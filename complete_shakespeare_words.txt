From
fairest
creatures
we
desire
increase,
That
thereby
beauty's
rose
might
never
die,
But
as
the
riper
should
by
time
decease,
His
tender
heir
might
bear
his
memory:
But
thou
contracted
to
thine
own
bright
eyes,
Feed'st
thy
light's
flame
with
self-substantial
fuel,
Making
a
famine
where
abundance
lies,
Thy
self
thy
foe,
to
thy
sweet
self
too
cruel:
Thou
that
art
now
the
world's
fresh
ornament,
And
only
herald
to
the
gaudy
spring,
Within
thine
own
bud
buriest
thy
content,
And
tender
churl
mak'st
waste
in
niggarding:
Pity
the
world,
or
else
this
glutton
be,
To
eat
the
world's
due,
by
the
grave
and
thee.

When
forty
winters
shall
besiege
thy
brow,
And
dig
deep
trenches
in
thy
beauty's
field,
Thy
youth's
proud
livery
so
gazed
on
now,
Will
be
a
tattered
weed
of
small
worth
held:
Then
being
asked,
where
all
thy
beauty
lies,
Where
all
the
treasure
of
thy
lusty
days;
To
say
within
thine
own
deep
sunken
eyes,
Were
an
all-eating
shame,
and
thriftless
praise.
How
much
more
praise
deserved
thy
beauty's
use,
If
thou
couldst
answer
'This
fair
child
of
mine
Shall
sum
my
count,
and
make
my
old
excuse'
Proving
his
beauty
by
succession
thine.
This
were
to
be
new
made
when
thou
art
old,
And
see
thy
blood
warm
when
thou
feel'st
it
cold.

Look
in
thy
glass
and
tell
the
face
thou
viewest,
Now
is
the
time
that
face
should
form
another,
Whose
fresh
repair
if
now
thou
not
renewest,
Thou
dost
beguile
the
world,
unbless
some
mother.
For
where
is
she
so
fair
whose
uneared
womb
Disdains
the
tillage
of
thy
husbandry?
Or
who
is
he
so
fond
will
be
the
tomb,
Of
his
self-love
to
stop
posterity?
Thou
art
thy
mother's
glass
and
she
in
thee
Calls
back
the
lovely
April
of
her
prime,
So
thou
through
windows
of
thine
age
shalt
see,
Despite
of
wrinkles
this
thy
golden
time.
But
if
thou
live
remembered
not
to
be,
Die
single
and
thine
image
dies
with
thee.

Unthrifty
loveliness
why
dost
thou
spend,
Upon
thy
self
thy
beauty's
legacy?
Nature's
bequest
gives
nothing
but
doth
lend,
And
being
frank
she
lends
to
those
are
free:
Then
beauteous
niggard
why
dost
thou
abuse,
The
bounteous
largess
given
thee
to
give?
Profitless
usurer
why
dost
thou
use
So
great
a
sum
of
sums
yet
canst
not
live?
For
having
traffic
with
thy
self
alone,
Thou
of
thy
self
thy
sweet
self
dost
deceive,
Then
how
when
nature
calls
thee
to
be
gone,
What
acceptable
audit
canst
thou
leave?
Thy
unused
beauty
must
be
tombed
with
thee,
Which
used
lives
th'
executor
to
be.

Those
hours
that
with
gentle
work
did
frame
The
lovely
gaze
where
every
eye
doth
dwell
Will
play
the
tyrants
to
the
very
same,
And
that
unfair
which
fairly
doth
excel:
For
never-resting
time
leads
summer
on
To
hideous
winter
and
confounds
him
there,
Sap
checked
with
frost
and
lusty
leaves
quite
gone,
Beauty
o'er-snowed
and
bareness
every
where:
Then
were
not
summer's
distillation
left
A
liquid
prisoner
pent
in
walls
of
glass,
Beauty's
effect
with
beauty
were
bereft,
Nor
it
nor
no
remembrance
what
it
was.
But
flowers
distilled
though
they
with
winter
meet,
Leese
but
their
show,
their
substance
still
lives
sweet.

Then
let
not
winter's
ragged
hand
deface,
In
thee
thy
summer
ere
thou
be
distilled:
Make
sweet
some
vial;
treasure
thou
some
place,
With
beauty's
treasure
ere
it
be
self-killed:
That
use
is
not
forbidden
usury,
Which
happies
those
that
pay
the
willing
loan;
That's
for
thy
self
to
breed
another
thee,
Or
ten
times
happier
be
it
ten
for
one,
Ten
times
thy
self
were
happier
than
thou
art,
If
ten
of
thine
ten
times
refigured
thee:
Then
what
could
death
do
if
thou
shouldst
depart,
Leaving
thee
living
in
posterity?
Be
not
self-willed
for
thou
art
much
too
fair,
To
be
death's
conquest
and
make
worms
thine
heir.

Lo
in
the
orient
when
the
gracious
light
Lifts
up
his
burning
head,
each
under
eye
Doth
homage
to
his
new-appearing
sight,
Serving
with
looks
his
sacred
majesty,
And
having
climbed
the
steep-up
heavenly
hill,
Resembling
strong
youth
in
his
middle
age,
Yet
mortal
looks
adore
his
beauty
still,
Attending
on
his
golden
pilgrimage:
But
when
from
highmost
pitch
with
weary
car,
Like
feeble
age
he
reeleth
from
the
day,
The
eyes
(fore
duteous)
now
converted
are
From
his
low
tract
and
look
another
way:
So
thou,
thy
self
out-going
in
thy
noon:
Unlooked
on
diest
unless
thou
get
a
son.

Music
to
hear,
why
hear'st
thou
music
sadly?
Sweets
with
sweets
war
not,
joy
delights
in
joy:
Why
lov'st
thou
that
which
thou
receiv'st
not
gladly,
Or
else
receiv'st
with
pleasure
thine
annoy?
If
the
true
concord
of
well-tuned
sounds,
By
unions
married
do
offend
thine
ear,
They
do
but
sweetly
chide
thee,
who
confounds
In
singleness
the
parts
that
thou
shouldst
bear:
Mark
how
one
string
sweet
husband
to
another,
Strikes
each
in
each
by
mutual
ordering;
Resembling
sire,
and
child,
and
happy
mother,
Who
all
in
one,
one
pleasing
note
do
sing:
Whose
speechless
song
being
many,
seeming
one,
Sings
this
to
thee,
'Thou
single
wilt
prove
none'.

Is
it
for
fear
to
wet
a
widow's
eye,
That
thou
consum'st
thy
self
in
single
life?
Ah,
if
thou
issueless
shalt
hap
to
die,
The
world
will
wail
thee
like
a
makeless
wife,
The
world
will
be
thy
widow
and
still
weep,
That
thou
no
form
of
thee
hast
left
behind,
When
every
private
widow
well
may
keep,
By
children's
eyes,
her
husband's
shape
in
mind:
Look
what
an
unthrift
in
the
world
doth
spend
Shifts
but
his
place,
for
still
the
world
enjoys
it;
But
beauty's
waste
hath
in
the
world
an
end,
And
kept
unused
the
user
so
destroys
it:
No
love
toward
others
in
that
bosom
sits
That
on
himself
such
murd'rous
shame
commits.

For
shame
deny
that
thou
bear'st
love
to
any
Who
for
thy
self
art
so
unprovident.
Grant
if
thou
wilt,
thou
art
beloved
of
many,
But
that
thou
none
lov'st
is
most
evident:
For
thou
art
so
possessed
with
murd'rous
hate,
That
'gainst
thy
self
thou
stick'st
not
to
conspire,
Seeking
that
beauteous
roof
to
ruinate
Which
to
repair
should
be
thy
chief
desire:
O
change
thy
thought,
that
I
may
change
my
mind,
Shall
hate
be
fairer
lodged
than
gentle
love?
Be
as
thy
presence
is
gracious
and
kind,
Or
to
thy
self
at
least
kind-hearted
prove,
Make
thee
another
self
for
love
of
me,
That
beauty
still
may
live
in
thine
or
thee.

As
fast
as
thou
shalt
wane
so
fast
thou
grow'st,
In
one
of
thine,
from
that
which
thou
departest,
And
that
fresh
blood
which
youngly
thou
bestow'st,
Thou
mayst
call
thine,
when
thou
from
youth
convertest,
Herein
lives
wisdom,
beauty,
and
increase,
Without
this
folly,
age,
and
cold
decay,
If
all
were
minded
so,
the
times
should
cease,
And
threescore
year
would
make
the
world
away:
Let
those
whom
nature
hath
not
made
for
store,
Harsh,
featureless,
and
rude,
barrenly
perish:
Look
whom
she
best
endowed,
she
gave
thee
more;
Which
bounteous
gift
thou
shouldst
in
bounty
cherish:
She
carved
thee
for
her
seal,
and
meant
thereby,
Thou
shouldst
print
more,
not
let
that
copy
die.

When
I
do
count
the
clock
that
tells
the
time,
And
see
the
brave
day
sunk
in
hideous
night,
When
I
behold
the
violet
past
prime,
And
sable
curls
all
silvered
o'er
with
white:
When
lofty
trees
I
see
barren
of
leaves,
Which
erst
from
heat
did
canopy
the
herd
And
summer's
green
all
girded
up
in
sheaves
Borne
on
the
bier
with
white
and
bristly
beard:
Then
of
thy
beauty
do
I
question
make
That
thou
among
the
wastes
of
time
must
go,
Since
sweets
and
beauties
do
themselves
forsake,
And
die
as
fast
as
they
see
others
grow,
And
nothing
'gainst
Time's
scythe
can
make
defence
Save
breed
to
brave
him,
when
he
takes
thee
hence.

O
that
you
were
your
self,
but
love
you
are
No
longer
yours,
than
you
your
self
here
live,
Against
this
coming
end
you
should
prepare,
And
your
sweet
semblance
to
some
other
give.
So
should
that
beauty
which
you
hold
in
lease
Find
no
determination,
then
you
were
Your
self
again
after
your
self's
decease,
When
your
sweet
issue
your
sweet
form
should
bear.
Who
lets
so
fair
a
house
fall
to
decay,
Which
husbandry
in
honour
might
uphold,
Against
the
stormy
gusts
of
winter's
day
And
barren
rage
of
death's
eternal
cold?
O
none
but
unthrifts,
dear
my
love
you
know,
You
had
a
father,
let
your
son
say
so.

Not
from
the
stars
do
I
my
judgement
pluck,
And
yet
methinks
I
have
astronomy,
But
not
to
tell
of
good,
or
evil
luck,
Of
plagues,
of
dearths,
or
seasons'
quality,
Nor
can
I
fortune
to
brief
minutes
tell;
Pointing
to
each
his
thunder,
rain
and
wind,
Or
say
with
princes
if
it
shall
go
well
By
oft
predict
that
I
in
heaven
find.
But
from
thine
eyes
my
knowledge
I
derive,
And
constant
stars
in
them
I
read
such
art
As
truth
and
beauty
shall
together
thrive
If
from
thy
self,
to
store
thou
wouldst
convert:
Or
else
of
thee
this
I
prognosticate,
Thy
end
is
truth's
and
beauty's
doom
and
date.

When
I
consider
every
thing
that
grows
Holds
in
perfection
but
a
little
moment.
That
this
huge
stage
presenteth
nought
but
shows
Whereon
the
stars
in
secret
influence
comment.
When
I
perceive
that
men
as
plants
increase,
Cheered
and
checked
even
by
the
self-same
sky:
Vaunt
in
their
youthful
sap,
at
height
decrease,
And
wear
their
brave
state
out
of
memory.
Then
the
conceit
of
this
inconstant
stay,
Sets
you
most
rich
in
youth
before
my
sight,
Where
wasteful
time
debateth
with
decay
To
change
your
day
of
youth
to
sullied
night,
And
all
in
war
with
Time
for
love
of
you,
As
he
takes
from
you,
I
engraft
you
new.

But
wherefore
do
not
you
a
mightier
way
Make
war
upon
this
bloody
tyrant
Time?
And
fortify
your
self
in
your
decay
With
means
more
blessed
than
my
barren
rhyme?
Now
stand
you
on
the
top
of
happy
hours,
And
many
maiden
gardens
yet
unset,
With
virtuous
wish
would
bear
you
living
flowers,
Much
liker
than
your
painted
counterfeit:
So
should
the
lines
of
life
that
life
repair
Which
this
(Time's
pencil)
or
my
pupil
pen
Neither
in
inward
worth
nor
outward
fair
Can
make
you
live
your
self
in
eyes
of
men.
To
give
away
your
self,
keeps
your
self
still,
And
you
must
live
drawn
by
your
own
sweet
skill.

Who
will
believe
my
verse
in
time
to
come
If
it
were
filled
with
your
most
high
deserts?
Though
yet
heaven
knows
it
is
but
as
a
tomb
Which
hides
your
life,
and
shows
not
half
your
parts:
If
I
could
write
the
beauty
of
your
eyes,
And
in
fresh
numbers
number
all
your
graces,
The
age
to
come
would
say
this
poet
lies,
Such
heavenly
touches
ne'er
touched
earthly
faces.
So
should
my
papers
(yellowed
with
their
age)
Be
scorned,
like
old
men
of
less
truth
than
tongue,
And
your
true
rights
be
termed
a
poet's
rage,
And
stretched
metre
of
an
antique
song.
But
were
some
child
of
yours
alive
that
time,
You
should
live
twice
in
it,
and
in
my
rhyme.

Shall
I
compare
thee
to
a
summer's
day?
Thou
art
more
lovely
and
more
temperate:
Rough
winds
do
shake
the
darling
buds
of
May,
And
summer's
lease
hath
all
too
short
a
date:
Sometime
too
hot
the
eye
of
heaven
shines,
And
often
is
his
gold
complexion
dimmed,
And
every
fair
from
fair
sometime
declines,
By
chance,
or
nature's
changing
course
untrimmed:
But
thy
eternal
summer
shall
not
fade,
Nor
lose
possession
of
that
fair
thou
ow'st,
Nor
shall
death
brag
thou
wand'rest
in
his
shade,
When
in
eternal
lines
to
time
thou
grow'st,
So
long
as
men
can
breathe
or
eyes
can
see,
So
long
lives
this,
and
this
gives
life
to
thee.

Devouring
Time
blunt
thou
the
lion's
paws,
And
make
the
earth
devour
her
own
sweet
brood,
Pluck
the
keen
teeth
from
the
fierce
tiger's
jaws,
And
burn
the
long-lived
phoenix,
in
her
blood,
Make
glad
and
sorry
seasons
as
thou
fleet'st,
And
do
whate'er
thou
wilt
swift-footed
Time
To
the
wide
world
and
all
her
fading
sweets:
But
I
forbid
thee
one
most
heinous
crime,
O
carve
not
with
thy
hours
my
love's
fair
brow,
Nor
draw
no
lines
there
with
thine
antique
pen,
Him
in
thy
course
untainted
do
allow,
For
beauty's
pattern
to
succeeding
men.
Yet
do
thy
worst
old
Time:
despite
thy
wrong,
My
love
shall
in
my
verse
ever
live
young.

A
woman's
face
with
nature's
own
hand
painted,
Hast
thou
the
master
mistress
of
my
passion,
A
woman's
gentle
heart
but
not
acquainted
With
shifting
change
as
is
false
women's
fashion,
An
eye
more
bright
than
theirs,
less
false
in
rolling:
Gilding
the
object
whereupon
it
gazeth,
A
man
in
hue
all
hues
in
his
controlling,
Which
steals
men's
eyes
and
women's
souls
amazeth.
And
for
a
woman
wert
thou
first
created,
Till
nature
as
she
wrought
thee
fell
a-doting,
And
by
addition
me
of
thee
defeated,
By
adding
one
thing
to
my
purpose
nothing.
But
since
she
pricked
thee
out
for
women's
pleasure,
Mine
be
thy
love
and
thy
love's
use
their
treasure.

So
is
it
not
with
me
as
with
that
muse,
Stirred
by
a
painted
beauty
to
his
verse,
Who
heaven
it
self
for
ornament
doth
use,
And
every
fair
with
his
fair
doth
rehearse,
Making
a
couplement
of
proud
compare
With
sun
and
moon,
with
earth
and
sea's
rich
gems:
With
April's
first-born
flowers
and
all
things
rare,
That
heaven's
air
in
this
huge
rondure
hems.
O
let
me
true
in
love
but
truly
write,
And
then
believe
me,
my
love
is
as
fair,
As
any
mother's
child,
though
not
so
bright
As
those
gold
candles
fixed
in
heaven's
air:
Let
them
say
more
that
like
of
hearsay
well,
I
will
not
praise
that
purpose
not
to
sell.

My
glass
shall
not
persuade
me
I
am
old,
So
long
as
youth
and
thou
are
of
one
date,
But
when
in
thee
time's
furrows
I
behold,
Then
look
I
death
my
days
should
expiate.
For
all
that
beauty
that
doth
cover
thee,
Is
but
the
seemly
raiment
of
my
heart,
Which
in
thy
breast
doth
live,
as
thine
in
me,
How
can
I
then
be
elder
than
thou
art?
O
therefore
love
be
of
thyself
so
wary,
As
I
not
for
my
self,
but
for
thee
will,
Bearing
thy
heart
which
I
will
keep
so
chary
As
tender
nurse
her
babe
from
faring
ill.
Presume
not
on
thy
heart
when
mine
is
slain,
Thou
gav'st
me
thine
not
to
give
back
again.

As
an
unperfect
actor
on
the
stage,
Who
with
his
fear
is
put
beside
his
part,
Or
some
fierce
thing
replete
with
too
much
rage,
Whose
strength's
abundance
weakens
his
own
heart;
So
I
for
fear
of
trust,
forget
to
say,
The
perfect
ceremony
of
love's
rite,
And
in
mine
own
love's
strength
seem
to
decay,
O'ercharged
with
burthen
of
mine
own
love's
might:
O
let
my
looks
be
then
the
eloquence,
And
dumb
presagers
of
my
speaking
breast,
Who
plead
for
love,
and
look
for
recompense,
More
than
that
tongue
that
more
hath
more
expressed.
O
learn
to
read
what
silent
love
hath
writ,
To
hear
with
eyes
belongs
to
love's
fine
wit.

Mine
eye
hath
played
the
painter
and
hath
stelled,
Thy
beauty's
form
in
table
of
my
heart,
My
body
is
the
frame
wherein
'tis
held,
And
perspective
it
is
best
painter's
art.
For
through
the
painter
must
you
see
his
skill,
To
find
where
your
true
image
pictured
lies,
Which
in
my
bosom's
shop
is
hanging
still,
That
hath
his
windows
glazed
with
thine
eyes:
Now
see
what
good
turns
eyes
for
eyes
have
done,
Mine
eyes
have
drawn
thy
shape,
and
thine
for
me
Are
windows
to
my
breast,
where-through
the
sun
Delights
to
peep,
to
gaze
therein
on
thee;
Yet
eyes
this
cunning
want
to
grace
their
art,
They
draw
but
what
they
see,
know
not
the
heart.

Let
those
who
are
in
favour
with
their
stars,
Of
public
honour
and
proud
titles
boast,
Whilst
I
whom
fortune
of
such
triumph
bars
Unlooked
for
joy
in
that
I
honour
most;
Great
princes'
favourites
their
fair
leaves
spread,
But
as
the
marigold
at
the
sun's
eye,
And
in
themselves
their
pride
lies
buried,
For
at
a
frown
they
in
their
glory
die.
The
painful
warrior
famoused
for
fight,
After
a
thousand
victories
once
foiled,
Is
from
the
book
of
honour
razed
quite,
And
all
the
rest
forgot
for
which
he
toiled:
Then
happy
I
that
love
and
am
beloved
Where
I
may
not
remove
nor
be
removed.

Lord
of
my
love,
to
whom
in
vassalage
Thy
merit
hath
my
duty
strongly
knit;
To
thee
I
send
this
written
embassage
To
witness
duty,
not
to
show
my
wit.
Duty
so
great,
which
wit
so
poor
as
mine
May
make
seem
bare,
in
wanting
words
to
show
it;
But
that
I
hope
some
good
conceit
of
thine
In
thy
soul's
thought
(all
naked)
will
bestow
it:
Till
whatsoever
star
that
guides
my
moving,
Points
on
me
graciously
with
fair
aspect,
And
puts
apparel
on
my
tattered
loving,
To
show
me
worthy
of
thy
sweet
respect,
Then
may
I
dare
to
boast
how
I
do
love
thee,
Till
then,
not
show
my
head
where
thou
mayst
prove
me.

Weary
with
toil,
I
haste
me
to
my
bed,
The
dear
respose
for
limbs
with
travel
tired,
But
then
begins
a
journey
in
my
head
To
work
my
mind,
when
body's
work's
expired.
For
then
my
thoughts
(from
far
where
I
abide)
Intend
a
zealous
pilgrimage
to
thee,
And
keep
my
drooping
eyelids
open
wide,
Looking
on
darkness
which
the
blind
do
see.
Save
that
my
soul's
imaginary
sight
Presents
thy
shadow
to
my
sightless
view,
Which
like
a
jewel
(hung
in
ghastly
night)
Makes
black
night
beauteous,
and
her
old
face
new.
Lo
thus
by
day
my
limbs,
by
night
my
mind,
For
thee,
and
for
my
self,
no
quiet
find.

How
can
I
then
return
in
happy
plight
That
am
debarred
the
benefit
of
rest?
When
day's
oppression
is
not
eased
by
night,
But
day
by
night
and
night
by
day
oppressed.
And
each
(though
enemies
to
either's
reign)
Do
in
consent
shake
hands
to
torture
me,
The
one
by
toil,
the
other
to
complain
How
far
I
toil,
still
farther
off
from
thee.
I
tell
the
day
to
please
him
thou
art
bright,
And
dost
him
grace
when
clouds
do
blot
the
heaven:
So
flatter
I
the
swart-complexioned
night,
When
sparkling
stars
twire
not
thou
gild'st
the
even.
But
day
doth
daily
draw
my
sorrows
longer,
And
night
doth
nightly
make
grief's
length
seem
stronger

When
in
disgrace
with
Fortune
and
men's
eyes,
I
all
alone
beweep
my
outcast
state,
And
trouble
deaf
heaven
with
my
bootless
cries,
And
look
upon
my
self
and
curse
my
fate,
Wishing
me
like
to
one
more
rich
in
hope,
Featured
like
him,
like
him
with
friends
possessed,
Desiring
this
man's
art,
and
that
man's
scope,
With
what
I
most
enjoy
contented
least,
Yet
in
these
thoughts
my
self
almost
despising,
Haply
I
think
on
thee,
and
then
my
state,
(Like
to
the
lark
at
break
of
day
arising
From
sullen
earth)
sings
hymns
at
heaven's
gate,
For
thy
sweet
love
remembered
such
wealth
brings,
That
then
I
scorn
to
change
my
state
with
kings.

When
to
the
sessions
of
sweet
silent
thought,
I
summon
up
remembrance
of
things
past,
I
sigh
the
lack
of
many
a
thing
I
sought,
And
with
old
woes
new
wail
my
dear
time's
waste:
Then
can
I
drown
an
eye
(unused
to
flow)
For
precious
friends
hid
in
death's
dateless
night,
And
weep
afresh
love's
long
since
cancelled
woe,
And
moan
th'
expense
of
many
a
vanished
sight.
Then
can
I
grieve
at
grievances
foregone,
And
heavily
from
woe
to
woe
tell
o'er
The
sad
account
of
fore-bemoaned
moan,
Which
I
new
pay
as
if
not
paid
before.
But
if
the
while
I
think
on
thee
(dear
friend)
All
losses
are
restored,
and
sorrows
end.

Thy
bosom
is
endeared
with
all
hearts,
Which
I
by
lacking
have
supposed
dead,
And
there
reigns
love
and
all
love's
loving
parts,
And
all
those
friends
which
I
thought
buried.
How
many
a
holy
and
obsequious
tear
Hath
dear
religious
love
stol'n
from
mine
eye,
As
interest
of
the
dead,
which
now
appear,
But
things
removed
that
hidden
in
thee
lie.
Thou
art
the
grave
where
buried
love
doth
live,
Hung
with
the
trophies
of
my
lovers
gone,
Who
all
their
parts
of
me
to
thee
did
give,
That
due
of
many,
now
is
thine
alone.
Their
images
I
loved,
I
view
in
thee,
And
thou
(all
they)
hast
all
the
all
of
me.

If
thou
survive
my
well-contented
day,
When
that
churl
death
my
bones
with
dust
shall
cover
And
shalt
by
fortune
once
more
re-survey
These
poor
rude
lines
of
thy
deceased
lover:
Compare
them
with
the
bett'ring
of
the
time,
And
though
they
be
outstripped
by
every
pen,
Reserve
them
for
my
love,
not
for
their
rhyme,
Exceeded
by
the
height
of
happier
men.
O
then
vouchsafe
me
but
this
loving
thought,
'Had
my
friend's
Muse
grown
with
this
growing
age,
A
dearer
birth
than
this
his
love
had
brought
To
march
in
ranks
of
better
equipage:
But
since
he
died
and
poets
better
prove,
Theirs
for
their
style
I'll
read,
his
for
his
love'.

Full
many
a
glorious
morning
have
I
seen,
Flatter
the
mountain
tops
with
sovereign
eye,
Kissing
with
golden
face
the
meadows
green;
Gilding
pale
streams
with
heavenly
alchemy:
Anon
permit
the
basest
clouds
to
ride,
With
ugly
rack
on
his
celestial
face,
And
from
the
forlorn
world
his
visage
hide
Stealing
unseen
to
west
with
this
disgrace:
Even
so
my
sun
one
early
morn
did
shine,
With
all
triumphant
splendour
on
my
brow,
But
out
alack,
he
was
but
one
hour
mine,
The
region
cloud
hath
masked
him
from
me
now.
Yet
him
for
this,
my
love
no
whit
disdaineth,
Suns
of
the
world
may
stain,
when
heaven's
sun
staineth.

Why
didst
thou
promise
such
a
beauteous
day,
And
make
me
travel
forth
without
my
cloak,
To
let
base
clouds
o'ertake
me
in
my
way,
Hiding
thy
brav'ry
in
their
rotten
smoke?
'Tis
not
enough
that
through
the
cloud
thou
break,
To
dry
the
rain
on
my
storm-beaten
face,
For
no
man
well
of
such
a
salve
can
speak,
That
heals
the
wound,
and
cures
not
the
disgrace:
Nor
can
thy
shame
give
physic
to
my
grief,
Though
thou
repent,
yet
I
have
still
the
loss,
Th'
offender's
sorrow
lends
but
weak
relief
To
him
that
bears
the
strong
offence's
cross.
Ah
but
those
tears
are
pearl
which
thy
love
sheds,
And
they
are
rich,
and
ransom
all
ill
deeds.

No
more
be
grieved
at
that
which
thou
hast
done,
Roses
have
thorns,
and
silver
fountains
mud,
Clouds
and
eclipses
stain
both
moon
and
sun,
And
loathsome
canker
lives
in
sweetest
bud.
All
men
make
faults,
and
even
I
in
this,
Authorizing
thy
trespass
with
compare,
My
self
corrupting
salving
thy
amiss,
Excusing
thy
sins
more
than
thy
sins
are:
For
to
thy
sensual
fault
I
bring
in
sense,
Thy
adverse
party
is
thy
advocate,
And
'gainst
my
self
a
lawful
plea
commence:
Such
civil
war
is
in
my
love
and
hate,
That
I
an
accessary
needs
must
be,
To
that
sweet
thief
which
sourly
robs
from
me.

Let
me
confess
that
we
two
must
be
twain,
Although
our
undivided
loves
are
one:
So
shall
those
blots
that
do
with
me
remain,
Without
thy
help,
by
me
be
borne
alone.
In
our
two
loves
there
is
but
one
respect,
Though
in
our
lives
a
separable
spite,
Which
though
it
alter
not
love's
sole
effect,
Yet
doth
it
steal
sweet
hours
from
love's
delight.
I
may
not
evermore
acknowledge
thee,
Lest
my
bewailed
guilt
should
do
thee
shame,
Nor
thou
with
public
kindness
honour
me,
Unless
thou
take
that
honour
from
thy
name:
But
do
not
so,
I
love
thee
in
such
sort,
As
thou
being
mine,
mine
is
thy
good
report.

As
a
decrepit
father
takes
delight,
To
see
his
active
child
do
deeds
of
youth,
So
I,
made
lame
by
Fortune's
dearest
spite
Take
all
my
comfort
of
thy
worth
and
truth.
For
whether
beauty,
birth,
or
wealth,
or
wit,
Or
any
of
these
all,
or
all,
or
more
Entitled
in
thy
parts,
do
crowned
sit,
I
make
my
love
engrafted
to
this
store:
So
then
I
am
not
lame,
poor,
nor
despised,
Whilst
that
this
shadow
doth
such
substance
give,
That
I
in
thy
abundance
am
sufficed,
And
by
a
part
of
all
thy
glory
live:
Look
what
is
best,
that
best
I
wish
in
thee,
This
wish
I
have,
then
ten
times
happy
me.

How
can
my
muse
want
subject
to
invent
While
thou
dost
breathe
that
pour'st
into
my
verse,
Thine
own
sweet
argument,
too
excellent,
For
every
vulgar
paper
to
rehearse?
O
give
thy
self
the
thanks
if
aught
in
me,
Worthy
perusal
stand
against
thy
sight,
For
who's
so
dumb
that
cannot
write
to
thee,
When
thou
thy
self
dost
give
invention
light?
Be
thou
the
tenth
Muse,
ten
times
more
in
worth
Than
those
old
nine
which
rhymers
invocate,
And
he
that
calls
on
thee,
let
him
bring
forth
Eternal
numbers
to
outlive
long
date.
If
my
slight
muse
do
please
these
curious
days,
The
pain
be
mine,
but
thine
shall
be
the
praise.

O
how
thy
worth
with
manners
may
I
sing,
When
thou
art
all
the
better
part
of
me?
What
can
mine
own
praise
to
mine
own
self
bring:
And
what
is't
but
mine
own
when
I
praise
thee?
Even
for
this,
let
us
divided
live,
And
our
dear
love
lose
name
of
single
one,
That
by
this
separation
I
may
give:
That
due
to
thee
which
thou
deserv'st
alone:
O
absence
what
a
torment
wouldst
thou
prove,
Were
it
not
thy
sour
leisure
gave
sweet
leave,
To
entertain
the
time
with
thoughts
of
love,
Which
time
and
thoughts
so
sweetly
doth
deceive.
And
that
thou
teachest
how
to
make
one
twain,
By
praising
him
here
who
doth
hence
remain.

Take
all
my
loves,
my
love,
yea
take
them
all,
What
hast
thou
then
more
than
thou
hadst
before?
No
love,
my
love,
that
thou
mayst
true
love
call,
All
mine
was
thine,
before
thou
hadst
this
more:
Then
if
for
my
love,
thou
my
love
receivest,
I
cannot
blame
thee,
for
my
love
thou
usest,
But
yet
be
blamed,
if
thou
thy
self
deceivest
By
wilful
taste
of
what
thy
self
refusest.
I
do
forgive
thy
robbery
gentle
thief
Although
thou
steal
thee
all
my
poverty:
And
yet
love
knows
it
is
a
greater
grief
To
bear
greater
wrong,
than
hate's
known
injury.
Lascivious
grace,
in
whom
all
ill
well
shows,
Kill
me
with
spites
yet
we
must
not
be
foes.

Those
pretty
wrongs
that
liberty
commits,
When
I
am
sometime
absent
from
thy
heart,
Thy
beauty,
and
thy
years
full
well
befits,
For
still
temptation
follows
where
thou
art.
Gentle
thou
art,
and
therefore
to
be
won,
Beauteous
thou
art,
therefore
to
be
assailed.
And
when
a
woman
woos,
what
woman's
son,
Will
sourly
leave
her
till
he
have
prevailed?
Ay
me,
but
yet
thou
mightst
my
seat
forbear,
And
chide
thy
beauty,
and
thy
straying
youth,
Who
lead
thee
in
their
riot
even
there
Where
thou
art
forced
to
break
a
twofold
truth:
Hers
by
thy
beauty
tempting
her
to
thee,
Thine
by
thy
beauty
being
false
to
me.

That
thou
hast
her
it
is
not
all
my
grief,
And
yet
it
may
be
said
I
loved
her
dearly,
That
she
hath
thee
is
of
my
wailing
chief,
A
loss
in
love
that
touches
me
more
nearly.
Loving
offenders
thus
I
will
excuse
ye,
Thou
dost
love
her,
because
thou
know'st
I
love
her,
And
for
my
sake
even
so
doth
she
abuse
me,
Suff'ring
my
friend
for
my
sake
to
approve
her.
If
I
lose
thee,
my
loss
is
my
love's
gain,
And
losing
her,
my
friend
hath
found
that
loss,
Both
find
each
other,
and
I
lose
both
twain,
And
both
for
my
sake
lay
on
me
this
cross,
But
here's
the
joy,
my
friend
and
I
are
one,
Sweet
flattery,
then
she
loves
but
me
alone.

When
most
I
wink
then
do
mine
eyes
best
see,
For
all
the
day
they
view
things
unrespected,
But
when
I
sleep,
in
dreams
they
look
on
thee,
And
darkly
bright,
are
bright
in
dark
directed.
Then
thou
whose
shadow
shadows
doth
make
bright
How
would
thy
shadow's
form,
form
happy
show,
To
the
clear
day
with
thy
much
clearer
light,
When
to
unseeing
eyes
thy
shade
shines
so!
How
would
(I
say)
mine
eyes
be
blessed
made,
By
looking
on
thee
in
the
living
day,
When
in
dead
night
thy
fair
imperfect
shade,
Through
heavy
sleep
on
sightless
eyes
doth
stay!
All
days
are
nights
to
see
till
I
see
thee,
And
nights
bright
days
when
dreams
do
show
thee
me.

If
the
dull
substance
of
my
flesh
were
thought,
Injurious
distance
should
not
stop
my
way,
For
then
despite
of
space
I
would
be
brought,
From
limits
far
remote,
where
thou
dost
stay,
No
matter
then
although
my
foot
did
stand
Upon
the
farthest
earth
removed
from
thee,
For
nimble
thought
can
jump
both
sea
and
land,
As
soon
as
think
the
place
where
he
would
be.
But
ah,
thought
kills
me
that
I
am
not
thought
To
leap
large
lengths
of
miles
when
thou
art
gone,
But
that
so
much
of
earth
and
water
wrought,
I
must
attend,
time's
leisure
with
my
moan.
Receiving
nought
by
elements
so
slow,
But
heavy
tears,
badges
of
either's
woe.

The
other
two,
slight
air,
and
purging
fire,
Are
both
with
thee,
wherever
I
abide,
The
first
my
thought,
the
other
my
desire,
These
present-absent
with
swift
motion
slide.
For
when
these
quicker
elements
are
gone
In
tender
embassy
of
love
to
thee,
My
life
being
made
of
four,
with
two
alone,
Sinks
down
to
death,
oppressed
with
melancholy.
Until
life's
composition
be
recured,
By
those
swift
messengers
returned
from
thee,
Who
even
but
now
come
back
again
assured,
Of
thy
fair
health,
recounting
it
to
me.
This
told,
I
joy,
but
then
no
longer
glad,
I
send
them
back
again
and
straight
grow
sad.

Mine
eye
and
heart
are
at
a
mortal
war,
How
to
divide
the
conquest
of
thy
sight,
Mine
eye,
my
heart
thy
picture's
sight
would
bar,
My
heart,
mine
eye
the
freedom
of
that
right,
My
heart
doth
plead
that
thou
in
him
dost
lie,
(A
closet
never
pierced
with
crystal
eyes)
But
the
defendant
doth
that
plea
deny,
And
says
in
him
thy
fair
appearance
lies.
To
side
this
title
is
impanelled
A
quest
of
thoughts,
all
tenants
to
the
heart,
And
by
their
verdict
is
determined
The
clear
eye's
moiety,
and
the
dear
heart's
part.
As
thus,
mine
eye's
due
is
thy
outward
part,
And
my
heart's
right,
thy
inward
love
of
heart.

Betwixt
mine
eye
and
heart
a
league
is
took,
And
each
doth
good
turns
now
unto
the
other,
When
that
mine
eye
is
famished
for
a
look,
Or
heart
in
love
with
sighs
himself
doth
smother;
With
my
love's
picture
then
my
eye
doth
feast,
And
to
the
painted
banquet
bids
my
heart:
Another
time
mine
eye
is
my
heart's
guest,
And
in
his
thoughts
of
love
doth
share
a
part.
So
either
by
thy
picture
or
my
love,
Thy
self
away,
art
present
still
with
me,
For
thou
not
farther
than
my
thoughts
canst
move,
And
I
am
still
with
them,
and
they
with
thee.
Or
if
they
sleep,
thy
picture
in
my
sight
Awakes
my
heart,
to
heart's
and
eye's
delight.

How
careful
was
I
when
I
took
my
way,
Each
trifle
under
truest
bars
to
thrust,
That
to
my
use
it
might
unused
stay
From
hands
of
falsehood,
in
sure
wards
of
trust!
But
thou,
to
whom
my
jewels
trifles
are,
Most
worthy
comfort,
now
my
greatest
grief,
Thou
best
of
dearest,
and
mine
only
care,
Art
left
the
prey
of
every
vulgar
thief.
Thee
have
I
not
locked
up
in
any
chest,
Save
where
thou
art
not,
though
I
feel
thou
art,
Within
the
gentle
closure
of
my
breast,
From
whence
at
pleasure
thou
mayst
come
and
part,
And
even
thence
thou
wilt
be
stol'n
I
fear,
For
truth
proves
thievish
for
a
prize
so
dear.

Against
that
time
(if
ever
that
time
come)
When
I
shall
see
thee
frown
on
my
defects,
When
as
thy
love
hath
cast
his
utmost
sum,
Called
to
that
audit
by
advised
respects,
Against
that
time
when
thou
shalt
strangely
pass,
And
scarcely
greet
me
with
that
sun
thine
eye,
When
love
converted
from
the
thing
it
was
Shall
reasons
find
of
settled
gravity;
Against
that
time
do
I
ensconce
me
here
Within
the
knowledge
of
mine
own
desert,
And
this
my
hand,
against
my
self
uprear,
To
guard
the
lawful
reasons
on
thy
part,
To
leave
poor
me,
thou
hast
the
strength
of
laws,
Since
why
to
love,
I
can
allege
no
cause.

How
heavy
do
I
journey
on
the
way,
When
what
I
seek
(my
weary
travel's
end)
Doth
teach
that
case
and
that
repose
to
say
'Thus
far
the
miles
are
measured
from
thy
friend.'
The
beast
that
bears
me,
tired
with
my
woe,
Plods
dully
on,
to
bear
that
weight
in
me,
As
if
by
some
instinct
the
wretch
did
know
His
rider
loved
not
speed
being
made
from
thee:
The
bloody
spur
cannot
provoke
him
on,
That
sometimes
anger
thrusts
into
his
hide,
Which
heavily
he
answers
with
a
groan,
More
sharp
to
me
than
spurring
to
his
side,
For
that
same
groan
doth
put
this
in
my
mind,
My
grief
lies
onward
and
my
joy
behind.

Thus
can
my
love
excuse
the
slow
offence,
Of
my
dull
bearer,
when
from
thee
I
speed,
From
where
thou
art,
why
should
I
haste
me
thence?
Till
I
return
of
posting
is
no
need.
O
what
excuse
will
my
poor
beast
then
find,
When
swift
extremity
can
seem
but
slow?
Then
should
I
spur
though
mounted
on
the
wind,
In
winged
speed
no
motion
shall
I
know,
Then
can
no
horse
with
my
desire
keep
pace,
Therefore
desire
(of
perfect'st
love
being
made)
Shall
neigh
(no
dull
flesh)
in
his
fiery
race,
But
love,
for
love,
thus
shall
excuse
my
jade,
Since
from
thee
going,
he
went
wilful-slow,
Towards
thee
I'll
run,
and
give
him
leave
to
go.

So
am
I
as
the
rich
whose
blessed
key,
Can
bring
him
to
his
sweet
up-locked
treasure,
The
which
he
will
not
every
hour
survey,
For
blunting
the
fine
point
of
seldom
pleasure.
Therefore
are
feasts
so
solemn
and
so
rare,
Since
seldom
coming
in
that
long
year
set,
Like
stones
of
worth
they
thinly
placed
are,
Or
captain
jewels
in
the
carcanet.
So
is
the
time
that
keeps
you
as
my
chest
Or
as
the
wardrobe
which
the
robe
doth
hide,
To
make
some
special
instant
special-blest,
By
new
unfolding
his
imprisoned
pride.
Blessed
are
you
whose
worthiness
gives
scope,
Being
had
to
triumph,
being
lacked
to
hope.

What
is
your
substance,
whereof
are
you
made,
That
millions
of
strange
shadows
on
you
tend?
Since
every
one,
hath
every
one,
one
shade,
And
you
but
one,
can
every
shadow
lend:
Describe
Adonis
and
the
counterfeit,
Is
poorly
imitated
after
you,
On
Helen's
cheek
all
art
of
beauty
set,
And
you
in
Grecian
tires
are
painted
new:
Speak
of
the
spring,
and
foison
of
the
year,
The
one
doth
shadow
of
your
beauty
show,
The
other
as
your
bounty
doth
appear,
And
you
in
every
blessed
shape
we
know.
In
all
external
grace
you
have
some
part,
But
you
like
none,
none
you
for
constant
heart.

O
how
much
more
doth
beauty
beauteous
seem,
By
that
sweet
ornament
which
truth
doth
give!
The
rose
looks
fair,
but
fairer
we
it
deem
For
that
sweet
odour,
which
doth
in
it
live:
The
canker
blooms
have
full
as
deep
a
dye,
As
the
perfumed
tincture
of
the
roses,
Hang
on
such
thorns,
and
play
as
wantonly,
When
summer's
breath
their
masked
buds
discloses:
But
for
their
virtue
only
is
their
show,
They
live
unwooed,
and
unrespected
fade,
Die
to
themselves.
Sweet
roses
do
not
so,
Of
their
sweet
deaths,
are
sweetest
odours
made:
And
so
of
you,
beauteous
and
lovely
youth,
When
that
shall
fade,
my
verse
distills
your
truth.

Not
marble,
nor
the
gilded
monuments
Of
princes
shall
outlive
this
powerful
rhyme,
But
you
shall
shine
more
bright
in
these
contents
Than
unswept
stone,
besmeared
with
sluttish
time.
When
wasteful
war
shall
statues
overturn,
And
broils
root
out
the
work
of
masonry,
Nor
Mars
his
sword,
nor
war's
quick
fire
shall
burn:
The
living
record
of
your
memory.
'Gainst
death,
and
all-oblivious
enmity
Shall
you
pace
forth,
your
praise
shall
still
find
room,
Even
in
the
eyes
of
all
posterity
That
wear
this
world
out
to
the
ending
doom.
So
till
the
judgment
that
your
self
arise,
You
live
in
this,
and
dwell
in
lovers'
eyes.

Sweet
love
renew
thy
force,
be
it
not
said
Thy
edge
should
blunter
be
than
appetite,
Which
but
to-day
by
feeding
is
allayed,
To-morrow
sharpened
in
his
former
might.
So
love
be
thou,
although
to-day
thou
fill
Thy
hungry
eyes,
even
till
they
wink
with
fulness,
To-morrow
see
again,
and
do
not
kill
The
spirit
of
love,
with
a
perpetual
dulness:
Let
this
sad
interim
like
the
ocean
be
Which
parts
the
shore,
where
two
contracted
new,
Come
daily
to
the
banks,
that
when
they
see:
Return
of
love,
more
blest
may
be
the
view.
Or
call
it
winter,
which
being
full
of
care,
Makes
summer's
welcome,
thrice
more
wished,
more
rare.

Being
your
slave
what
should
I
do
but
tend,
Upon
the
hours,
and
times
of
your
desire?
I
have
no
precious
time
at
all
to
spend;
Nor
services
to
do
till
you
require.
Nor
dare
I
chide
the
world-without-end
hour,
Whilst
I
(my
sovereign)
watch
the
clock
for
you,
Nor
think
the
bitterness
of
absence
sour,
When
you
have
bid
your
servant
once
adieu.
Nor
dare
I
question
with
my
jealous
thought,
Where
you
may
be,
or
your
affairs
suppose,
But
like
a
sad
slave
stay
and
think
of
nought
Save
where
you
are,
how
happy
you
make
those.
So
true
a
fool
is
love,
that
in
your
will,
(Though
you
do
any
thing)
he
thinks
no
ill.

That
god
forbid,
that
made
me
first
your
slave,
I
should
in
thought
control
your
times
of
pleasure,
Or
at
your
hand
th'
account
of
hours
to
crave,
Being
your
vassal
bound
to
stay
your
leisure.
O
let
me
suffer
(being
at
your
beck)
Th'
imprisoned
absence
of
your
liberty,
And
patience
tame
to
sufferance
bide
each
check,
Without
accusing
you
of
injury.
Be
where
you
list,
your
charter
is
so
strong,
That
you
your
self
may
privilage
your
time
To
what
you
will,
to
you
it
doth
belong,
Your
self
to
pardon
of
self-doing
crime.
I
am
to
wait,
though
waiting
so
be
hell,
Not
blame
your
pleasure
be
it
ill
or
well.

If
there
be
nothing
new,
but
that
which
is,
Hath
been
before,
how
are
our
brains
beguiled,
Which
labouring
for
invention
bear
amis
The
second
burthen
of
a
former
child!
O
that
record
could
with
a
backward
look,
Even
of
five
hundred
courses
of
the
sun,
Show
me
your
image
in
some
antique
book,
Since
mind
at
first
in
character
was
done.
That
I
might
see
what
the
old
world
could
say,
To
this
composed
wonder
of
your
frame,
Whether
we
are
mended,
or
whether
better
they,
Or
whether
revolution
be
the
same.
O
sure
I
am
the
wits
of
former
days,
To
subjects
worse
have
given
admiring
praise.

Like
as
the
waves
make
towards
the
pebbled
shore,
So
do
our
minutes
hasten
to
their
end,
Each
changing
place
with
that
which
goes
before,
In
sequent
toil
all
forwards
do
contend.
Nativity
once
in
the
main
of
light,
Crawls
to
maturity,
wherewith
being
crowned,
Crooked
eclipses
'gainst
his
glory
fight,
And
Time
that
gave,
doth
now
his
gift
confound.
Time
doth
transfix
the
flourish
set
on
youth,
And
delves
the
parallels
in
beauty's
brow,
Feeds
on
the
rarities
of
nature's
truth,
And
nothing
stands
but
for
his
scythe
to
mow.
And
yet
to
times
in
hope,
my
verse
shall
stand
Praising
thy
worth,
despite
his
cruel
hand.

Is
it
thy
will,
thy
image
should
keep
open
My
heavy
eyelids
to
the
weary
night?
Dost
thou
desire
my
slumbers
should
be
broken,
While
shadows
like
to
thee
do
mock
my
sight?
Is
it
thy
spirit
that
thou
send'st
from
thee
So
far
from
home
into
my
deeds
to
pry,
To
find
out
shames
and
idle
hours
in
me,
The
scope
and
tenure
of
thy
jealousy?
O
no,
thy
love
though
much,
is
not
so
great,
It
is
my
love
that
keeps
mine
eye
awake,
Mine
own
true
love
that
doth
my
rest
defeat,
To
play
the
watchman
ever
for
thy
sake.
For
thee
watch
I,
whilst
thou
dost
wake
elsewhere,
From
me
far
off,
with
others
all
too
near.

Sin
of
self-love
possesseth
all
mine
eye,
And
all
my
soul,
and
all
my
every
part;
And
for
this
sin
there
is
no
remedy,
It
is
so
grounded
inward
in
my
heart.
Methinks
no
face
so
gracious
is
as
mine,
No
shape
so
true,
no
truth
of
such
account,
And
for
my
self
mine
own
worth
do
define,
As
I
all
other
in
all
worths
surmount.
But
when
my
glass
shows
me
my
self
indeed
beated
and
chopt
with
tanned
antiquity,
Mine
own
self-love
quite
contrary
I
read:
Self,
so
self-loving
were
iniquity.
'Tis
thee
(my
self)
that
for
my
self
I
praise,
Painting
my
age
with
beauty
of
thy
days.

Against
my
love
shall
be
as
I
am
now
With
Time's
injurious
hand
crushed
and
o'erworn,
When
hours
have
drained
his
blood
and
filled
his
brow
With
lines
and
wrinkles,
when
his
youthful
morn
Hath
travelled
on
to
age's
steepy
night,
And
all
those
beauties
whereof
now
he's
king
Are
vanishing,
or
vanished
out
of
sight,
Stealing
away
the
treasure
of
his
spring:
For
such
a
time
do
I
now
fortify
Against
confounding
age's
cruel
knife,
That
he
shall
never
cut
from
memory
My
sweet
love's
beauty,
though
my
lover's
life.
His
beauty
shall
in
these
black
lines
be
seen,
And
they
shall
live,
and
he
in
them
still
green.

When
I
have
seen
by
Time's
fell
hand
defaced
The
rich-proud
cost
of
outworn
buried
age,
When
sometime
lofty
towers
I
see
down-rased,
And
brass
eternal
slave
to
mortal
rage.
When
I
have
seen
the
hungry
ocean
gain
Advantage
on
the
kingdom
of
the
shore,
And
the
firm
soil
win
of
the
watery
main,
Increasing
store
with
loss,
and
loss
with
store.
When
I
have
seen
such
interchange
of
State,
Or
state
it
self
confounded,
to
decay,
Ruin
hath
taught
me
thus
to
ruminate
That
Time
will
come
and
take
my
love
away.
This
thought
is
as
a
death
which
cannot
choose
But
weep
to
have,
that
which
it
fears
to
lose.

Since
brass,
nor
stone,
nor
earth,
nor
boundless
sea,
But
sad
mortality
o'ersways
their
power,
How
with
this
rage
shall
beauty
hold
a
plea,
Whose
action
is
no
stronger
than
a
flower?
O
how
shall
summer's
honey
breath
hold
out,
Against
the
wrackful
siege
of
batt'ring
days,
When
rocks
impregnable
are
not
so
stout,
Nor
gates
of
steel
so
strong
but
time
decays?
O
fearful
meditation,
where
alack,
Shall
Time's
best
jewel
from
Time's
chest
lie
hid?
Or
what
strong
hand
can
hold
his
swift
foot
back,
Or
who
his
spoil
of
beauty
can
forbid?
O
none,
unless
this
miracle
have
might,
That
in
black
ink
my
love
may
still
shine
bright.

Tired
with
all
these
for
restful
death
I
cry,
As
to
behold
desert
a
beggar
born,
And
needy
nothing
trimmed
in
jollity,
And
purest
faith
unhappily
forsworn,
And
gilded
honour
shamefully
misplaced,
And
maiden
virtue
rudely
strumpeted,
And
right
perfection
wrongfully
disgraced,
And
strength
by
limping
sway
disabled
And
art
made
tongue-tied
by
authority,
And
folly
(doctor-like)
controlling
skill,
And
simple
truth
miscalled
simplicity,
And
captive
good
attending
captain
ill.
Tired
with
all
these,
from
these
would
I
be
gone,
Save
that
to
die,
I
leave
my
love
alone.

Ah
wherefore
with
infection
should
he
live,
And
with
his
presence
grace
impiety,
That
sin
by
him
advantage
should
achieve,
And
lace
it
self
with
his
society?
Why
should
false
painting
imitate
his
cheek,
And
steal
dead
seeming
of
his
living
hue?
Why
should
poor
beauty
indirectly
seek,
Roses
of
shadow,
since
his
rose
is
true?
Why
should
he
live,
now
nature
bankrupt
is,
Beggared
of
blood
to
blush
through
lively
veins,
For
she
hath
no
exchequer
now
but
his,
And
proud
of
many,
lives
upon
his
gains?
O
him
she
stores,
to
show
what
wealth
she
had,
In
days
long
since,
before
these
last
so
bad.

Thus
is
his
cheek
the
map
of
days
outworn,
When
beauty
lived
and
died
as
flowers
do
now,
Before
these
bastard
signs
of
fair
were
born,
Or
durst
inhabit
on
a
living
brow:
Before
the
golden
tresses
of
the
dead,
The
right
of
sepulchres,
were
shorn
away,
To
live
a
second
life
on
second
head,
Ere
beauty's
dead
fleece
made
another
gay:
In
him
those
holy
antique
hours
are
seen,
Without
all
ornament,
it
self
and
true,
Making
no
summer
of
another's
green,
Robbing
no
old
to
dress
his
beauty
new,
And
him
as
for
a
map
doth
Nature
store,
To
show
false
Art
what
beauty
was
of
yore.

Those
parts
of
thee
that
the
world's
eye
doth
view,
Want
nothing
that
the
thought
of
hearts
can
mend:
All
tongues
(the
voice
of
souls)
give
thee
that
due,
Uttering
bare
truth,
even
so
as
foes
commend.
Thy
outward
thus
with
outward
praise
is
crowned,
But
those
same
tongues
that
give
thee
so
thine
own,
In
other
accents
do
this
praise
confound
By
seeing
farther
than
the
eye
hath
shown.
They
look
into
the
beauty
of
thy
mind,
And
that
in
guess
they
measure
by
thy
deeds,
Then
churls
their
thoughts
(although
their
eyes
were
kind)
To
thy
fair
flower
add
the
rank
smell
of
weeds:
But
why
thy
odour
matcheth
not
thy
show,
The
soil
is
this,
that
thou
dost
common
grow.

That
thou
art
blamed
shall
not
be
thy
defect,
For
slander's
mark
was
ever
yet
the
fair,
The
ornament
of
beauty
is
suspect,
A
crow
that
flies
in
heaven's
sweetest
air.
So
thou
be
good,
slander
doth
but
approve,
Thy
worth
the
greater
being
wooed
of
time,
For
canker
vice
the
sweetest
buds
doth
love,
And
thou
present'st
a
pure
unstained
prime.
Thou
hast
passed
by
the
ambush
of
young
days,
Either
not
assailed,
or
victor
being
charged,
Yet
this
thy
praise
cannot
be
so
thy
praise,
To
tie
up
envy,
evermore
enlarged,
If
some
suspect
of
ill
masked
not
thy
show,
Then
thou
alone
kingdoms
of
hearts
shouldst
owe.

No
longer
mourn
for
me
when
I
am
dead,
Than
you
shall
hear
the
surly
sullen
bell
Give
warning
to
the
world
that
I
am
fled
From
this
vile
world
with
vilest
worms
to
dwell:
Nay
if
you
read
this
line,
remember
not,
The
hand
that
writ
it,
for
I
love
you
so,
That
I
in
your
sweet
thoughts
would
be
forgot,
If
thinking
on
me
then
should
make
you
woe.
O
if
(I
say)
you
look
upon
this
verse,
When
I
(perhaps)
compounded
am
with
clay,
Do
not
so
much
as
my
poor
name
rehearse;
But
let
your
love
even
with
my
life
decay.
Lest
the
wise
world
should
look
into
your
moan,
And
mock
you
with
me
after
I
am
gone.

O
lest
the
world
should
task
you
to
recite,
What
merit
lived
in
me
that
you
should
love
After
my
death
(dear
love)
forget
me
quite,
For
you
in
me
can
nothing
worthy
prove.
Unless
you
would
devise
some
virtuous
lie,
To
do
more
for
me
than
mine
own
desert,
And
hang
more
praise
upon
deceased
I,
Than
niggard
truth
would
willingly
impart:
O
lest
your
true
love
may
seem
false
in
this,
That
you
for
love
speak
well
of
me
untrue,
My
name
be
buried
where
my
body
is,
And
live
no
more
to
shame
nor
me,
nor
you.
For
I
am
shamed
by
that
which
I
bring
forth,
And
so
should
you,
to
love
things
nothing
worth.

That
time
of
year
thou
mayst
in
me
behold,
When
yellow
leaves,
or
none,
or
few
do
hang
Upon
those
boughs
which
shake
against
the
cold,
Bare
ruined
choirs,
where
late
the
sweet
birds
sang.
In
me
thou
seest
the
twilight
of
such
day,
As
after
sunset
fadeth
in
the
west,
Which
by
and
by
black
night
doth
take
away,
Death's
second
self
that
seals
up
all
in
rest.
In
me
thou
seest
the
glowing
of
such
fire,
That
on
the
ashes
of
his
youth
doth
lie,
As
the
death-bed,
whereon
it
must
expire,
Consumed
with
that
which
it
was
nourished
by.
This
thou
perceiv'st,
which
makes
thy
love
more
strong,
To
love
that
well,
which
thou
must
leave
ere
long.

But
be
contented
when
that
fell
arrest,
Without
all
bail
shall
carry
me
away,
My
life
hath
in
this
line
some
interest,
Which
for
memorial
still
with
thee
shall
stay.
When
thou
reviewest
this,
thou
dost
review,
The
very
part
was
consecrate
to
thee,
The
earth
can
have
but
earth,
which
is
his
due,
My
spirit
is
thine
the
better
part
of
me,
So
then
thou
hast
but
lost
the
dregs
of
life,
The
prey
of
worms,
my
body
being
dead,
The
coward
conquest
of
a
wretch's
knife,
Too
base
of
thee
to
be
remembered,
The
worth
of
that,
is
that
which
it
contains,
And
that
is
this,
and
this
with
thee
remains.

So
are
you
to
my
thoughts
as
food
to
life,
Or
as
sweet-seasoned
showers
are
to
the
ground;
And
for
the
peace
of
you
I
hold
such
strife
As
'twixt
a
miser
and
his
wealth
is
found.
Now
proud
as
an
enjoyer,
and
anon
Doubting
the
filching
age
will
steal
his
treasure,
Now
counting
best
to
be
with
you
alone,
Then
bettered
that
the
world
may
see
my
pleasure,
Sometime
all
full
with
feasting
on
your
sight,
And
by
and
by
clean
starved
for
a
look,
Possessing
or
pursuing
no
delight
Save
what
is
had,
or
must
from
you
be
took.
Thus
do
I
pine
and
surfeit
day
by
day,
Or
gluttoning
on
all,
or
all
away.

Why
is
my
verse
so
barren
of
new
pride?
So
far
from
variation
or
quick
change?
Why
with
the
time
do
I
not
glance
aside
To
new-found
methods,
and
to
compounds
strange?
Why
write
I
still
all
one,
ever
the
same,
And
keep
invention
in
a
noted
weed,
That
every
word
doth
almost
tell
my
name,
Showing
their
birth,
and
where
they
did
proceed?
O
know
sweet
love
I
always
write
of
you,
And
you
and
love
are
still
my
argument:
So
all
my
best
is
dressing
old
words
new,
Spending
again
what
is
already
spent:
For
as
the
sun
is
daily
new
and
old,
So
is
my
love
still
telling
what
is
told.

Thy
glass
will
show
thee
how
thy
beauties
wear,
Thy
dial
how
thy
precious
minutes
waste,
These
vacant
leaves
thy
mind's
imprint
will
bear,
And
of
this
book,
this
learning
mayst
thou
taste.
The
wrinkles
which
thy
glass
will
truly
show,
Of
mouthed
graves
will
give
thee
memory,
Thou
by
thy
dial's
shady
stealth
mayst
know,
Time's
thievish
progress
to
eternity.
Look
what
thy
memory
cannot
contain,
Commit
to
these
waste
blanks,
and
thou
shalt
find
Those
children
nursed,
delivered
from
thy
brain,
To
take
a
new
acquaintance
of
thy
mind.
These
offices,
so
oft
as
thou
wilt
look,
Shall
profit
thee,
and
much
enrich
thy
book.

So
oft
have
I
invoked
thee
for
my
muse,
And
found
such
fair
assistance
in
my
verse,
As
every
alien
pen
hath
got
my
use,
And
under
thee
their
poesy
disperse.
Thine
eyes,
that
taught
the
dumb
on
high
to
sing,
And
heavy
ignorance
aloft
to
fly,
Have
added
feathers
to
the
learned's
wing,
And
given
grace
a
double
majesty.
Yet
be
most
proud
of
that
which
I
compile,
Whose
influence
is
thine,
and
born
of
thee,
In
others'
works
thou
dost
but
mend
the
style,
And
arts
with
thy
sweet
graces
graced
be.
But
thou
art
all
my
art,
and
dost
advance
As
high
as
learning,
my
rude
ignorance.

Whilst
I
alone
did
call
upon
thy
aid,
My
verse
alone
had
all
thy
gentle
grace,
But
now
my
gracious
numbers
are
decayed,
And
my
sick
muse
doth
give
an
other
place.
I
grant
(sweet
love)
thy
lovely
argument
Deserves
the
travail
of
a
worthier
pen,
Yet
what
of
thee
thy
poet
doth
invent,
He
robs
thee
of,
and
pays
it
thee
again,
He
lends
thee
virtue,
and
he
stole
that
word,
From
thy
behaviour,
beauty
doth
he
give
And
found
it
in
thy
cheek:
he
can
afford
No
praise
to
thee,
but
what
in
thee
doth
live.
Then
thank
him
not
for
that
which
he
doth
say,
Since
what
he
owes
thee,
thou
thy
self
dost
pay.

O
how
I
faint
when
I
of
you
do
write,
Knowing
a
better
spirit
doth
use
your
name,
And
in
the
praise
thereof
spends
all
his
might,
To
make
me
tongue-tied
speaking
of
your
fame.
But
since
your
worth
(wide
as
the
ocean
is)
The
humble
as
the
proudest
sail
doth
bear,
My
saucy
bark
(inferior
far
to
his)
On
your
broad
main
doth
wilfully
appear.
Your
shallowest
help
will
hold
me
up
afloat,
Whilst
he
upon
your
soundless
deep
doth
ride,
Or
(being
wrecked)
I
am
a
worthless
boat,
He
of
tall
building,
and
of
goodly
pride.
Then
if
he
thrive
and
I
be
cast
away,
The
worst
was
this,
my
love
was
my
decay.

Or
I
shall
live
your
epitaph
to
make,
Or
you
survive
when
I
in
earth
am
rotten,
From
hence
your
memory
death
cannot
take,
Although
in
me
each
part
will
be
forgotten.
Your
name
from
hence
immortal
life
shall
have,
Though
I
(once
gone)
to
all
the
world
must
die,
The
earth
can
yield
me
but
a
common
grave,
When
you
entombed
in
men's
eyes
shall
lie,
Your
monument
shall
be
my
gentle
verse,
Which
eyes
not
yet
created
shall
o'er-read,
And
tongues
to
be,
your
being
shall
rehearse,
When
all
the
breathers
of
this
world
are
dead,
You
still
shall
live
(such
virtue
hath
my
pen)
Where
breath
most
breathes,
even
in
the
mouths
of
men.

I
grant
thou
wert
not
married
to
my
muse,
And
therefore
mayst
without
attaint
o'erlook
The
dedicated
words
which
writers
use
Of
their
fair
subject,
blessing
every
book.
Thou
art
as
fair
in
knowledge
as
in
hue,
Finding
thy
worth
a
limit
past
my
praise,
And
therefore
art
enforced
to
seek
anew,
Some
fresher
stamp
of
the
time-bettering
days.
And
do
so
love,
yet
when
they
have
devised,
What
strained
touches
rhetoric
can
lend,
Thou
truly
fair,
wert
truly
sympathized,
In
true
plain
words,
by
thy
true-telling
friend.
And
their
gross
painting
might
be
better
used,
Where
cheeks
need
blood,
in
thee
it
is
abused.

I
never
saw
that
you
did
painting
need,
And
therefore
to
your
fair
no
painting
set,
I
found
(or
thought
I
found)
you
did
exceed,
That
barren
tender
of
a
poet's
debt:
And
therefore
have
I
slept
in
your
report,
That
you
your
self
being
extant
well
might
show,
How
far
a
modern
quill
doth
come
too
short,
Speaking
of
worth,
what
worth
in
you
doth
grow.
This
silence
for
my
sin
you
did
impute,
Which
shall
be
most
my
glory
being
dumb,
For
I
impair
not
beauty
being
mute,
When
others
would
give
life,
and
bring
a
tomb.
There
lives
more
life
in
one
of
your
fair
eyes,
Than
both
your
poets
can
in
praise
devise.

Who
is
it
that
says
most,
which
can
say
more,
Than
this
rich
praise,
that
you
alone,
are
you?
In
whose
confine
immured
is
the
store,
Which
should
example
where
your
equal
grew.
Lean
penury
within
that
pen
doth
dwell,
That
to
his
subject
lends
not
some
small
glory,
But
he
that
writes
of
you,
if
he
can
tell,
That
you
are
you,
so
dignifies
his
story.
Let
him
but
copy
what
in
you
is
writ,
Not
making
worse
what
nature
made
so
clear,
And
such
a
counterpart
shall
fame
his
wit,
Making
his
style
admired
every
where.
You
to
your
beauteous
blessings
add
a
curse,
Being
fond
on
praise,
which
makes
your
praises
worse.

My
tongue-tied
muse
in
manners
holds
her
still,
While
comments
of
your
praise
richly
compiled,
Reserve
their
character
with
golden
quill,
And
precious
phrase
by
all
the
Muses
filed.
I
think
good
thoughts,
whilst
other
write
good
words,
And
like
unlettered
clerk
still
cry
Amen,
To
every
hymn
that
able
spirit
affords,
In
polished
form
of
well
refined
pen.
Hearing
you
praised,
I
say
'tis
so,
'tis
true,
And
to
the
most
of
praise
add
something
more,
But
that
is
in
my
thought,
whose
love
to
you
(Though
words
come
hindmost)
holds
his
rank
before,
Then
others,
for
the
breath
of
words
respect,
Me
for
my
dumb
thoughts,
speaking
in
effect.

Was
it
the
proud
full
sail
of
his
great
verse,
Bound
for
the
prize
of
(all
too
precious)
you,
That
did
my
ripe
thoughts
in
my
brain
inhearse,
Making
their
tomb
the
womb
wherein
they
grew?
Was
it
his
spirit,
by
spirits
taught
to
write,
Above
a
mortal
pitch,
that
struck
me
dead?
No,
neither
he,
nor
his
compeers
by
night
Giving
him
aid,
my
verse
astonished.
He
nor
that
affable
familiar
ghost
Which
nightly
gulls
him
with
intelligence,
As
victors
of
my
silence
cannot
boast,
I
was
not
sick
of
any
fear
from
thence.
But
when
your
countenance
filled
up
his
line,
Then
lacked
I
matter,
that
enfeebled
mine.

Farewell!
thou
art
too
dear
for
my
possessing,
And
like
enough
thou
know'st
thy
estimate,
The
charter
of
thy
worth
gives
thee
releasing:
My
bonds
in
thee
are
all
determinate.
For
how
do
I
hold
thee
but
by
thy
granting,
And
for
that
riches
where
is
my
deserving?
The
cause
of
this
fair
gift
in
me
is
wanting,
And
so
my
patent
back
again
is
swerving.
Thy
self
thou
gav'st,
thy
own
worth
then
not
knowing,
Or
me
to
whom
thou
gav'st
it,
else
mistaking,
So
thy
great
gift
upon
misprision
growing,
Comes
home
again,
on
better
judgement
making.
Thus
have
I
had
thee
as
a
dream
doth
flatter,
In
sleep
a
king,
but
waking
no
such
matter.

When
thou
shalt
be
disposed
to
set
me
light,
And
place
my
merit
in
the
eye
of
scorn,
Upon
thy
side,
against
my
self
I'll
fight,
And
prove
thee
virtuous,
though
thou
art
forsworn:
With
mine
own
weakness
being
best
acquainted,
Upon
thy
part
I
can
set
down
a
story
Of
faults
concealed,
wherein
I
am
attainted:
That
thou
in
losing
me,
shalt
win
much
glory:
And
I
by
this
will
be
a
gainer
too,
For
bending
all
my
loving
thoughts
on
thee,
The
injuries
that
to
my
self
I
do,
Doing
thee
vantage,
double-vantage
me.
Such
is
my
love,
to
thee
I
so
belong,
That
for
thy
right,
my
self
will
bear
all
wrong.

Say
that
thou
didst
forsake
me
for
some
fault,
And
I
will
comment
upon
that
offence,
Speak
of
my
lameness,
and
I
straight
will
halt:
Against
thy
reasons
making
no
defence.
Thou
canst
not
(love)
disgrace
me
half
so
ill,
To
set
a
form
upon
desired
change,
As
I'll
my
self
disgrace,
knowing
thy
will,
I
will
acquaintance
strangle
and
look
strange:
Be
absent
from
thy
walks
and
in
my
tongue,
Thy
sweet
beloved
name
no
more
shall
dwell,
Lest
I
(too
much
profane)
should
do
it
wronk:
And
haply
of
our
old
acquaintance
tell.
For
thee,
against
my
self
I'll
vow
debate,
For
I
must
ne'er
love
him
whom
thou
dost
hate.

Then
hate
me
when
thou
wilt,
if
ever,
now,
Now
while
the
world
is
bent
my
deeds
to
cross,
join
with
the
spite
of
fortune,
make
me
bow,
And
do
not
drop
in
for
an
after-loss:
Ah
do
not,
when
my
heart
hath
'scaped
this
sorrow,
Come
in
the
rearward
of
a
conquered
woe,
Give
not
a
windy
night
a
rainy
morrow,
To
linger
out
a
purposed
overthrow.
If
thou
wilt
leave
me,
do
not
leave
me
last,
When
other
petty
griefs
have
done
their
spite,
But
in
the
onset
come,
so
shall
I
taste
At
first
the
very
worst
of
fortune's
might.
And
other
strains
of
woe,
which
now
seem
woe,
Compared
with
loss
of
thee,
will
not
seem
so.

Some
glory
in
their
birth,
some
in
their
skill,
Some
in
their
wealth,
some
in
their
body's
force,
Some
in
their
garments
though
new-fangled
ill:
Some
in
their
hawks
and
hounds,
some
in
their
horse.
And
every
humour
hath
his
adjunct
pleasure,
Wherein
it
finds
a
joy
above
the
rest,
But
these
particulars
are
not
my
measure,
All
these
I
better
in
one
general
best.
Thy
love
is
better
than
high
birth
to
me,
Richer
than
wealth,
prouder
than
garments'
costs,
Of
more
delight
than
hawks
and
horses
be:
And
having
thee,
of
all
men's
pride
I
boast.
Wretched
in
this
alone,
that
thou
mayst
take,
All
this
away,
and
me
most
wretchcd
make.

But
do
thy
worst
to
steal
thy
self
away,
For
term
of
life
thou
art
assured
mine,
And
life
no
longer
than
thy
love
will
stay,
For
it
depends
upon
that
love
of
thine.
Then
need
I
not
to
fear
the
worst
of
wrongs,
When
in
the
least
of
them
my
life
hath
end,
I
see,
a
better
state
to
me
belongs
Than
that,
which
on
thy
humour
doth
depend.
Thou
canst
not
vex
me
with
inconstant
mind,
Since
that
my
life
on
thy
revolt
doth
lie,
O
what
a
happy
title
do
I
find,
Happy
to
have
thy
love,
happy
to
die!
But
what's
so
blessed-fair
that
fears
no
blot?
Thou
mayst
be
false,
and
yet
I
know
it
not.

So
shall
I
live,
supposing
thou
art
true,
Like
a
deceived
husband,
so
love's
face,
May
still
seem
love
to
me,
though
altered
new:
Thy
looks
with
me,
thy
heart
in
other
place.
For
there
can
live
no
hatred
in
thine
eye,
Therefore
in
that
I
cannot
know
thy
change,
In
many's
looks,
the
false
heart's
history
Is
writ
in
moods
and
frowns
and
wrinkles
strange.
But
heaven
in
thy
creation
did
decree,
That
in
thy
face
sweet
love
should
ever
dwell,
Whate'er
thy
thoughts,
or
thy
heart's
workings
be,
Thy
looks
should
nothing
thence,
but
sweetness
tell.
How
like
Eve's
apple
doth
thy
beauty
grow,
If
thy
sweet
virtue
answer
not
thy
show.

They
that
have
power
to
hurt,
and
will
do
none,
That
do
not
do
the
thing,
they
most
do
show,
Who
moving
others,
are
themselves
as
stone,
Unmoved,
cold,
and
to
temptation
slow:
They
rightly
do
inherit
heaven's
graces,
And
husband
nature's
riches
from
expense,
Tibey
are
the
lords
and
owners
of
their
faces,
Others,
but
stewards
of
their
excellence:
The
summer's
flower
is
to
the
summer
sweet,
Though
to
it
self,
it
only
live
and
die,
But
if
that
flower
with
base
infection
meet,
The
basest
weed
outbraves
his
dignity:
For
sweetest
things
turn
sourest
by
their
deeds,
Lilies
that
fester,
smell
far
worse
than
weeds.

How
sweet
and
lovely
dost
thou
make
the
shame,
Which
like
a
canker
in
the
fragrant
rose,
Doth
spot
the
beauty
of
thy
budding
name!
O
in
what
sweets
dost
thou
thy
sins
enclose!
That
tongue
that
tells
the
story
of
thy
days,
(Making
lascivious
comments
on
thy
sport)
Cannot
dispraise,
but
in
a
kind
of
praise,
Naming
thy
name,
blesses
an
ill
report.
O
what
a
mansion
have
those
vices
got,
Which
for
their
habitation
chose
out
thee,
Where
beauty's
veil
doth
cover
every
blot,
And
all
things
turns
to
fair,
that
eyes
can
see!
Take
heed
(dear
heart)
of
this
large
privilege,
The
hardest
knife
ill-used
doth
lose
his
edge.

Some
say
thy
fault
is
youth,
some
wantonness,
Some
say
thy
grace
is
youth
and
gentle
sport,
Both
grace
and
faults
are
loved
of
more
and
less:
Thou
mak'st
faults
graces,
that
to
thee
resort:
As
on
the
finger
of
a
throned
queen,
The
basest
jewel
will
be
well
esteemed:
So
are
those
errors
that
in
thee
are
seen,
To
truths
translated,
and
for
true
things
deemed.
How
many
lambs
might
the
stern
wolf
betray,
If
like
a
lamb
he
could
his
looks
translate!
How
many
gazers
mightst
thou
lead
away,
if
thou
wouldst
use
the
strength
of
all
thy
state!
But
do
not
so,
I
love
thee
in
such
sort,
As
thou
being
mine,
mine
is
thy
good
report.

How
like
a
winter
hath
my
absence
been
From
thee,
the
pleasure
of
the
fleeting
year!
What
freezings
have
I
felt,
what
dark
days
seen!
What
old
December's
bareness
everywhere!
And
yet
this
time
removed
was
summer's
time,
The
teeming
autumn
big
with
rich
increase,
Bearing
the
wanton
burden
of
the
prime,
Like
widowed
wombs
after
their
lords'
decease:
Yet
this
abundant
issue
seemed
to
me
But
hope
of
orphans,
and
unfathered
fruit,
For
summer
and
his
pleasures
wait
on
thee,
And
thou
away,
the
very
birds
are
mute.
Or
if
they
sing,
'tis
with
so
dull
a
cheer,
That
leaves
look
pale,
dreading
the
winter's
near.

From
you
have
I
been
absent
in
the
spring,
When
proud-pied
April
(dressed
in
all
his
trim)
Hath
put
a
spirit
of
youth
in
every
thing:
That
heavy
Saturn
laughed
and
leaped
with
him.
Yet
nor
the
lays
of
birds,
nor
the
sweet
smell
Of
different
flowers
in
odour
and
in
hue,
Could
make
me
any
summer's
story
tell:
Or
from
their
proud
lap
pluck
them
where
they
grew:
Nor
did
I
wonder
at
the
lily's
white,
Nor
praise
the
deep
vermilion
in
the
rose,
They
were
but
sweet,
but
figures
of
delight:
Drawn
after
you,
you
pattern
of
all
those.
Yet
seemed
it
winter
still,
and
you
away,
As
with
your
shadow
I
with
these
did
play.

The
forward
violet
thus
did
I
chide,
Sweet
thief,
whence
didst
thou
steal
thy
sweet
that
smells,
If
not
from
my
love's
breath?
The
purple
pride
Which
on
thy
soft
check
for
complexion
dwells,
In
my
love's
veins
thou
hast
too
grossly
dyed.
The
lily
I
condemned
for
thy
hand,
And
buds
of
marjoram
had
stol'n
thy
hair,
The
roses
fearfully
on
thorns
did
stand,
One
blushing
shame,
another
white
despair:
A
third
nor
red,
nor
white,
had
stol'n
of
both,
And
to
his
robbery
had
annexed
thy
breath,
But
for
his
theft
in
pride
of
all
his
growth
A
vengeful
canker
eat
him
up
to
death.
More
flowers
I
noted,
yet
I
none
could
see,
But
sweet,
or
colour
it
had
stol'n
from
thee.

Where
art
thou
Muse
that
thou
forget'st
so
long,
To
speak
of
that
which
gives
thee
all
thy
might?
Spend'st
thou
thy
fury
on
some
worthless
song,
Darkening
thy
power
to
lend
base
subjects
light?
Return
forgetful
Muse,
and
straight
redeem,
In
gentle
numbers
time
so
idly
spent,
Sing
to
the
ear
that
doth
thy
lays
esteem,
And
gives
thy
pen
both
skill
and
argument.
Rise
resty
Muse,
my
love's
sweet
face
survey,
If
time
have
any
wrinkle
graven
there,
If
any,
be
a
satire
to
decay,
And
make
time's
spoils
despised
everywhere.
Give
my
love
fame
faster
than
Time
wastes
life,
So
thou
prevent'st
his
scythe,
and
crooked
knife.

O
truant
Muse
what
shall
be
thy
amends,
For
thy
neglect
of
truth
in
beauty
dyed?
Both
truth
and
beauty
on
my
love
depends:
So
dost
thou
too,
and
therein
dignified:
Make
answer
Muse,
wilt
thou
not
haply
say,
'Truth
needs
no
colour
with
his
colour
fixed,
Beauty
no
pencil,
beauty's
truth
to
lay:
But
best
is
best,
if
never
intermixed'?
Because
he
needs
no
praise,
wilt
thou
be
dumb?
Excuse
not
silence
so,
for't
lies
in
thee,
To
make
him
much
outlive
a
gilded
tomb:
And
to
be
praised
of
ages
yet
to
be.
Then
do
thy
office
Muse,
I
teach
thee
how,
To
make
him
seem
long
hence,
as
he
shows
now.

My
love
is
strengthened
though
more
weak
in
seeming,
I
love
not
less,
though
less
the
show
appear,
That
love
is
merchandized,
whose
rich
esteeming,
The
owner's
tongue
doth
publish
every
where.
Our
love
was
new,
and
then
but
in
the
spring,
When
I
was
wont
to
greet
it
with
my
lays,
As
Philomel
in
summer's
front
doth
sing,
And
stops
her
pipe
in
growth
of
riper
days:
Not
that
the
summer
is
less
pleasant
now
Than
when
her
mournful
hymns
did
hush
the
night,
But
that
wild
music
burthens
every
bough,
And
sweets
grown
common
lose
their
dear
delight.
Therefore
like
her,
I
sometime
hold
my
tongue:
Because
I
would
not
dull
you
with
my
song.

Alack
what
poverty
my
muse
brings
forth,
That
having
such
a
scope
to
show
her
pride,
The
argument
all
bare
is
of
more
worth
Than
when
it
hath
my
added
praise
beside.
O
blame
me
not
if
I
no
more
can
write!
Look
in
your
glass
and
there
appears
a
face,
That
over-goes
my
blunt
invention
quite,
Dulling
my
lines,
and
doing
me
disgrace.
Were
it
not
sinful
then
striving
to
mend,
To
mar
the
subject
that
before
was
well?
For
to
no
other
pass
my
verses
tend,
Than
of
your
graces
and
your
gifts
to
tell.
And
more,
much
more
than
in
my
verse
can
sit,
Your
own
glass
shows
you,
when
you
look
in
it.

To
me
fair
friend
you
never
can
be
old,
For
as
you
were
when
first
your
eye
I
eyed,
Such
seems
your
beauty
still:
three
winters
cold,
Have
from
the
forests
shook
three
summers'
pride,
Three
beauteous
springs
to
yellow
autumn
turned,
In
process
of
the
seasons
have
I
seen,
Three
April
perfumes
in
three
hot
Junes
burned,
Since
first
I
saw
you
fresh
which
yet
are
green.
Ah
yet
doth
beauty
like
a
dial
hand,
Steal
from
his
figure,
and
no
pace
perceived,
So
your
sweet
hue,
which
methinks
still
doth
stand
Hath
motion,
and
mine
eye
may
be
deceived.
For
fear
of
which,
hear
this
thou
age
unbred,
Ere
you
were
born
was
beauty's
summer
dead.

Let
not
my
love
be
called
idolatry,
Nor
my
beloved
as
an
idol
show,
Since
all
alike
my
songs
and
praises
be
To
one,
of
one,
still
such,
and
ever
so.
Kind
is
my
love
to-day,
to-morrow
kind,
Still
constant
in
a
wondrous
excellence,
Therefore
my
verse
to
constancy
confined,
One
thing
expressing,
leaves
out
difference.
Fair,
kind,
and
true,
is
all
my
argument,
Fair,
kind,
and
true,
varying
to
other
words,
And
in
this
change
is
my
invention
spent,
Three
themes
in
one,
which
wondrous
scope
affords.
Fair,
kind,
and
true,
have
often
lived
alone.
Which
three
till
now,
never
kept
seat
in
one.

When
in
the
chronicle
of
wasted
time,
I
see
descriptions
of
the
fairest
wights,
And
beauty
making
beautiful
old
rhyme,
In
praise
of
ladies
dead,
and
lovely
knights,
Then
in
the
blazon
of
sweet
beauty's
best,
Of
hand,
of
foot,
of
lip,
of
eye,
of
brow,
I
see
their
antique
pen
would
have
expressed,
Even
such
a
beauty
as
you
master
now.
So
all
their
praises
are
but
prophecies
Of
this
our
time,
all
you
prefiguring,
And
for
they
looked
but
with
divining
eyes,
They
had
not
skill
enough
your
worth
to
sing:
For
we
which
now
behold
these
present
days,
Have
eyes
to
wonder,
but
lack
tongues
to
praise.

Not
mine
own
fears,
nor
the
prophetic
soul,
Of
the
wide
world,
dreaming
on
things
to
come,
Can
yet
the
lease
of
my
true
love
control,
Supposed
as
forfeit
to
a
confined
doom.
The
mortal
moon
hath
her
eclipse
endured,
And
the
sad
augurs
mock
their
own
presage,
Incertainties
now
crown
themselves
assured,
And
peace
proclaims
olives
of
endless
age.
Now
with
the
drops
of
this
most
balmy
time,
My
love
looks
fresh,
and
death
to
me
subscribes,
Since
spite
of
him
I'll
live
in
this
poor
rhyme,
While
he
insults
o'er
dull
and
speechless
tribes.
And
thou
in
this
shalt
find
thy
monument,
When
tyrants'
crests
and
tombs
of
brass
are
spent.

What's
in
the
brain
that
ink
may
character,
Which
hath
not
figured
to
thee
my
true
spirit,
What's
new
to
speak,
what
now
to
register,
That
may
express
my
love,
or
thy
dear
merit?
Nothing
sweet
boy,
but
yet
like
prayers
divine,
I
must
each
day
say
o'er
the
very
same,
Counting
no
old
thing
old,
thou
mine,
I
thine,
Even
as
when
first
I
hallowed
thy
fair
name.
So
that
eternal
love
in
love's
fresh
case,
Weighs
not
the
dust
and
injury
of
age,
Nor
gives
to
necessary
wrinkles
place,
But
makes
antiquity
for
aye
his
page,
Finding
the
first
conceit
of
love
there
bred,
Where
time
and
outward
form
would
show
it
dead.

O
never
say
that
I
was
false
of
heart,
Though
absence
seemed
my
flame
to
qualify,
As
easy
might
I
from
my
self
depart,
As
from
my
soul
which
in
thy
breast
doth
lie:
That
is
my
home
of
love,
if
I
have
ranged,
Like
him
that
travels
I
return
again,
Just
to
the
time,
not
with
the
time
exchanged,
So
that
my
self
bring
water
for
my
stain,
Never
believe
though
in
my
nature
reigned,
All
frailties
that
besiege
all
kinds
of
blood,
That
it
could
so
preposterously
be
stained,
To
leave
for
nothing
all
thy
sum
of
good:
For
nothing
this
wide
universe
I
call,
Save
thou
my
rose,
in
it
thou
art
my
all.

Alas
'tis
true,
I
have
gone
here
and
there,
And
made
my
self
a
motley
to
the
view,
Gored
mine
own
thoughts,
sold
cheap
what
is
most
dear,
Made
old
offences
of
affections
new.
Most
true
it
is,
that
I
have
looked
on
truth
Askance
and
strangely:
but
by
all
above,
These
blenches
gave
my
heart
another
youth,
And
worse
essays
proved
thee
my
best
of
love.
Now
all
is
done,
have
what
shall
have
no
end,
Mine
appetite
I
never
more
will
grind
On
newer
proof,
to
try
an
older
friend,
A
god
in
love,
to
whom
I
am
confined.
Then
give
me
welcome,
next
my
heaven
the
best,
Even
to
thy
pure
and
most
most
loving
breast.

O
for
my
sake
do
you
with
Fortune
chide,
The
guilty
goddess
of
my
harmful
deeds,
That
did
not
better
for
my
life
provide,
Than
public
means
which
public
manners
breeds.
Thence
comes
it
that
my
name
receives
a
brand,
And
almost
thence
my
nature
is
subdued
To
what
it
works
in,
like
the
dyer's
hand:
Pity
me
then,
and
wish
I
were
renewed,
Whilst
like
a
willing
patient
I
will
drink,
Potions
of
eisel
'gainst
my
strong
infection,
No
bitterness
that
I
will
bitter
think,
Nor
double
penance
to
correct
correction.
Pity
me
then
dear
friend,
and
I
assure
ye,
Even
that
your
pity
is
enough
to
cure
me.

Your
love
and
pity
doth
th'
impression
fill,
Which
vulgar
scandal
stamped
upon
my
brow,
For
what
care
I
who
calls
me
well
or
ill,
So
you
o'er-green
my
bad,
my
good
allow?
You
are
my
all
the
world,
and
I
must
strive,
To
know
my
shames
and
praises
from
your
tongue,
None
else
to
me,
nor
I
to
none
alive,
That
my
steeled
sense
or
changes
right
or
wrong.
In
so
profound
abysm
I
throw
all
care
Of
others'
voices,
that
my
adder's
sense,
To
critic
and
to
flatterer
stopped
are:
Mark
how
with
my
neglect
I
do
dispense.
You
are
so
strongly
in
my
purpose
bred,
That
all
the
world
besides
methinks
are
dead.

Since
I
left
you,
mine
eye
is
in
my
mind,
And
that
which
governs
me
to
go
about,
Doth
part
his
function,
and
is
partly
blind,
Seems
seeing,
but
effectually
is
out:
For
it
no
form
delivers
to
the
heart
Of
bird,
of
flower,
or
shape
which
it
doth
latch,
Of
his
quick
objects
hath
the
mind
no
part,
Nor
his
own
vision
holds
what
it
doth
catch:
For
if
it
see
the
rud'st
or
gentlest
sight,
The
most
sweet
favour
or
deformed'st
creature,
The
mountain,
or
the
sea,
the
day,
or
night:
The
crow,
or
dove,
it
shapes
them
to
your
feature.
Incapable
of
more,
replete
with
you,
My
most
true
mind
thus
maketh
mine
untrue.

Or
whether
doth
my
mind
being
crowned
with
you
Drink
up
the
monarch's
plague
this
flattery?
Or
whether
shall
I
say
mine
eye
saith
true,
And
that
your
love
taught
it
this
alchemy?
To
make
of
monsters,
and
things
indigest,
Such
cherubins
as
your
sweet
self
resemble,
Creating
every
bad
a
perfect
best
As
fast
as
objects
to
his
beams
assemble:
O
'tis
the
first,
'tis
flattery
in
my
seeing,
And
my
great
mind
most
kingly
drinks
it
up,
Mine
eye
well
knows
what
with
his
gust
is
'greeing,
And
to
his
palate
doth
prepare
the
cup.
If
it
be
poisoned,
'tis
the
lesser
sin,
That
mine
eye
loves
it
and
doth
first
begin.

Those
lines
that
I
before
have
writ
do
lie,
Even
those
that
said
I
could
not
love
you
dearer,
Yet
then
my
judgment
knew
no
reason
why,
My
most
full
flame
should
afterwards
burn
clearer,
But
reckoning
time,
whose
millioned
accidents
Creep
in
'twixt
vows,
and
change
decrees
of
kings,
Tan
sacred
beauty,
blunt
the
sharp'st
intents,
Divert
strong
minds
to
the
course
of
alt'ring
things:
Alas
why
fearing
of
time's
tyranny,
Might
I
not
then
say
'Now
I
love
you
best,'
When
I
was
certain
o'er
incertainty,
Crowning
the
present,
doubting
of
the
rest?
Love
is
a
babe,
then
might
I
not
say
so
To
give
full
growth
to
that
which
still
doth
grow.

Let
me
not
to
the
marriage
of
true
minds
Admit
impediments,
love
is
not
love
Which
alters
when
it
alteration
finds,
Or
bends
with
the
remover
to
remove.
O
no,
it
is
an
ever-fixed
mark
That
looks
on
tempests
and
is
never
shaken;
It
is
the
star
to
every
wand'ring
bark,
Whose
worth's
unknown,
although
his
height
be
taken.
Love's
not
Time's
fool,
though
rosy
lips
and
cheeks
Within
his
bending
sickle's
compass
come,
Love
alters
not
with
his
brief
hours
and
weeks,
But
bears
it
out
even
to
the
edge
of
doom:
If
this
be
error
and
upon
me
proved,
I
never
writ,
nor
no
man
ever
loved.

Accuse
me
thus,
that
I
have
scanted
all,
Wherein
I
should
your
great
deserts
repay,
Forgot
upon
your
dearest
love
to
call,
Whereto
all
bonds
do
tie
me
day
by
day,
That
I
have
frequent
been
with
unknown
minds,
And
given
to
time
your
own
dear-purchased
right,
That
I
have
hoisted
sail
to
all
the
winds
Which
should
transport
me
farthest
from
your
sight.
Book
both
my
wilfulness
and
errors
down,
And
on
just
proof
surmise,
accumulate,
Bring
me
within
the
level
of
your
frown,
But
shoot
not
at
me
in
your
wakened
hate:
Since
my
appeal
says
I
did
strive
to
prove
The
constancy
and
virtue
of
your
love.

Like
as
to
make
our
appetite
more
keen
With
eager
compounds
we
our
palate
urge,
As
to
prevent
our
maladies
unseen,
We
sicken
to
shun
sickness
when
we
purge.
Even
so
being
full
of
your
ne'er-cloying
sweetness,
To
bitter
sauces
did
I
frame
my
feeding;
And
sick
of
welfare
found
a
kind
of
meetness,
To
be
diseased
ere
that
there
was
true
needing.
Thus
policy
in
love
t'
anticipate
The
ills
that
were
not,
grew
to
faults
assured,
And
brought
to
medicine
a
healthful
state
Which
rank
of
goodness
would
by
ill
be
cured.
But
thence
I
learn
and
find
the
lesson
true,
Drugs
poison
him
that
so
feil
sick
of
you.

What
potions
have
I
drunk
of
Siren
tears
Distilled
from
limbecks
foul
as
hell
within,
Applying
fears
to
hopes,
and
hopes
to
fears,
Still
losing
when
I
saw
my
self
to
win!
What
wretched
errors
hath
my
heart
committed,
Whilst
it
hath
thought
it
self
so
blessed
never!
How
have
mine
eyes
out
of
their
spheres
been
fitted
In
the
distraction
of
this
madding
fever!
O
benefit
of
ill,
now
I
find
true
That
better
is,
by
evil
still
made
better.
And
ruined
love
when
it
is
built
anew
Grows
fairer
than
at
first,
more
strong,
far
greater.
So
I
return
rebuked
to
my
content,
And
gain
by
ills
thrice
more
than
I
have
spent.

That
you
were
once
unkind
befriends
me
now,
And
for
that
sorrow,
which
I
then
did
feel,
Needs
must
I
under
my
transgression
bow,
Unless
my
nerves
were
brass
or
hammered
steel.
For
if
you
were
by
my
unkindness
shaken
As
I
by
yours,
y'have
passed
a
hell
of
time,
And
I
a
tyrant
have
no
leisure
taken
To
weigh
how
once
I
suffered
in
your
crime.
O
that
our
night
of
woe
might
have
remembered
My
deepest
sense,
how
hard
true
sorrow
hits,
And
soon
to
you,
as
you
to
me
then
tendered
The
humble
salve,
which
wounded
bosoms
fits!
But
that
your
trespass
now
becomes
a
fee,
Mine
ransoms
yours,
and
yours
must
ransom
me.

'Tis
better
to
be
vile
than
vile
esteemed,
When
not
to
be,
receives
reproach
of
being,
And
the
just
pleasure
lost,
which
is
so
deemed,
Not
by
our
feeling,
but
by
others'
seeing.
For
why
should
others'
false
adulterate
eyes
Give
salutation
to
my
sportive
blood?
Or
on
my
frailties
why
are
frailer
spies,
Which
in
their
wills
count
bad
what
I
think
good?
No,
I
am
that
I
am,
and
they
that
level
At
my
abuses,
reckon
up
their
own,
I
may
be
straight
though
they
themselves
be
bevel;
By
their
rank
thoughts,
my
deeds
must
not
be
shown
Unless
this
general
evil
they
maintain,
All
men
are
bad
and
in
their
badness
reign.

Thy
gift,
thy
tables,
are
within
my
brain
Full
charactered
with
lasting
memory,
Which
shall
above
that
idle
rank
remain
Beyond
all
date
even
to
eternity.
Or
at
the
least,
so
long
as
brain
and
heart
Have
faculty
by
nature
to
subsist,
Till
each
to
razed
oblivion
yield
his
part
Of
thee,
thy
record
never
can
be
missed:
That
poor
retention
could
not
so
much
hold,
Nor
need
I
tallies
thy
dear
love
to
score,
Therefore
to
give
them
from
me
was
I
bold,
To
trust
those
tables
that
receive
thee
more:
To
keep
an
adjunct
to
remember
thee
Were
to
import
forgetfulness
in
me.

No!
Time,
thou
shalt
not
boast
that
I
do
change,
Thy
pyramids
built
up
with
newer
might
To
me
are
nothing
novel,
nothing
strange,
They
are
but
dressings
Of
a
former
sight:
Our
dates
are
brief,
and
therefore
we
admire,
What
thou
dost
foist
upon
us
that
is
old,
And
rather
make
them
born
to
our
desire,
Than
think
that
we
before
have
heard
them
told:
Thy
registers
and
thee
I
both
defy,
Not
wond'ring
at
the
present,
nor
the
past,
For
thy
records,
and
what
we
see
doth
lie,
Made
more
or
less
by
thy
continual
haste:
This
I
do
vow
and
this
shall
ever
be,
I
will
be
true
despite
thy
scythe
and
thee.

If
my
dear
love
were
but
the
child
of
state,
It
might
for
Fortune's
bastard
be
unfathered,
As
subject
to
time's
love
or
to
time's
hate,
Weeds
among
weeds,
or
flowers
with
flowers
gathered.
No
it
was
builded
far
from
accident,
It
suffers
not
in
smiling
pomp,
nor
falls
Under
the
blow
of
thralled
discontent,
Whereto
th'
inviting
time
our
fashion
calls:
It
fears
not
policy
that
heretic,
Which
works
on
leases
of
short-numbered
hours,
But
all
alone
stands
hugely
politic,
That
it
nor
grows
with
heat,
nor
drowns
with
showers.
To
this
I
witness
call
the
fools
of
time,
Which
die
for
goodness,
who
have
lived
for
crime.

Were't
aught
to
me
I
bore
the
canopy,
With
my
extern
the
outward
honouring,
Or
laid
great
bases
for
eternity,
Which
proves
more
short
than
waste
or
ruining?
Have
I
not
seen
dwellers
on
form
and
favour
Lose
all,
and
more
by
paying
too
much
rent
For
compound
sweet;
forgoing
simple
savour,
Pitiful
thrivers
in
their
gazing
spent?
No,
let
me
be
obsequious
in
thy
heart,
And
take
thou
my
oblation,
poor
but
free,
Which
is
not
mixed
with
seconds,
knows
no
art,
But
mutual
render,
only
me
for
thee.
Hence,
thou
suborned
informer,
a
true
soul
When
most
impeached,
stands
least
in
thy
control.

O
thou
my
lovely
boy
who
in
thy
power,
Dost
hold
Time's
fickle
glass
his
fickle
hour:
Who
hast
by
waning
grown,
and
therein
show'st,
Thy
lovers
withering,
as
thy
sweet
self
grow'st.
If
Nature
(sovereign
mistress
over
wrack)
As
thou
goest
onwards
still
will
pluck
thee
back,
She
keeps
thee
to
this
purpose,
that
her
skill
May
time
disgrace,
and
wretched
minutes
kill.
Yet
fear
her
O
thou
minion
of
her
pleasure,
She
may
detain,
but
not
still
keep
her
treasure!
Her
audit
(though
delayed)
answered
must
be,
And
her
quietus
is
to
render
thee.

In
the
old
age
black
was
not
counted
fair,
Or
if
it
were
it
bore
not
beauty's
name:
But
now
is
black
beauty's
successive
heir,
And
beauty
slandered
with
a
bastard
shame,
For
since
each
hand
hath
put
on
nature's
power,
Fairing
the
foul
with
art's
false
borrowed
face,
Sweet
beauty
hath
no
name
no
holy
bower,
But
is
profaned,
if
not
lives
in
disgrace.
Therefore
my
mistress'
eyes
are
raven
black,
Her
eyes
so
suited,
and
they
mourners
seem,
At
such
who
not
born
fair
no
beauty
lack,
Slandering
creation
with
a
false
esteem,
Yet
so
they
mourn
becoming
of
their
woe,
That
every
tongue
says
beauty
should
look
so.

How
oft
when
thou,
my
music,
music
play'st,
Upon
that
blessed
wood
whose
motion
sounds
With
thy
sweet
fingers
when
thou
gently
sway'st
The
wiry
concord
that
mine
ear
confounds,
Do
I
envy
those
jacks
that
nimble
leap,
To
kiss
the
tender
inward
of
thy
hand,
Whilst
my
poor
lips
which
should
that
harvest
reap,
At
the
wood's
boldness
by
thee
blushing
stand.
To
be
so
tickled
they
would
change
their
state
And
situation
with
those
dancing
chips,
O'er
whom
thy
fingers
walk
with
gentle
gait,
Making
dead
wood
more
blest
than
living
lips,
Since
saucy
jacks
so
happy
are
in
this,
Give
them
thy
fingers,
me
thy
lips
to
kiss.

Th'
expense
of
spirit
in
a
waste
of
shame
Is
lust
in
action,
and
till
action,
lust
Is
perjured,
murd'rous,
bloody
full
of
blame,
Savage,
extreme,
rude,
cruel,
not
to
trust,
Enjoyed
no
sooner
but
despised
straight,
Past
reason
hunted,
and
no
sooner
had
Past
reason
hated
as
a
swallowed
bait,
On
purpose
laid
to
make
the
taker
mad.
Mad
in
pursuit
and
in
possession
so,
Had,
having,
and
in
quest,
to
have
extreme,
A
bliss
in
proof
and
proved,
a
very
woe,
Before
a
joy
proposed
behind
a
dream.
All
this
the
world
well
knows
yet
none
knows
well,
To
shun
the
heaven
that
leads
men
to
this
hell.

My
mistress'
eyes
are
nothing
like
the
sun,
Coral
is
far
more
red,
than
her
lips
red,
If
snow
be
white,
why
then
her
breasts
are
dun:
If
hairs
be
wires,
black
wires
grow
on
her
head:
I
have
seen
roses
damasked,
red
and
white,
But
no
such
roses
see
I
in
her
cheeks,
And
in
some
perfumes
is
there
more
delight,
Than
in
the
breath
that
from
my
mistress
reeks.
I
love
to
hear
her
speak,
yet
well
I
know,
That
music
hath
a
far
more
pleasing
sound:
I
grant
I
never
saw
a
goddess
go,
My
mistress
when
she
walks
treads
on
the
ground.
And
yet
by
heaven
I
think
my
love
as
rare,
As
any
she
belied
with
false
compare.

Thou
art
as
tyrannous,
so
as
thou
art,
As
those
whose
beauties
proudly
make
them
cruel;
For
well
thou
know'st
to
my
dear
doting
heart
Thou
art
the
fairest
and
most
precious
jewel.
Yet
in
good
faith
some
say
that
thee
behold,
Thy
face
hath
not
the
power
to
make
love
groan;
To
say
they
err,
I
dare
not
be
so
bold,
Although
I
swear
it
to
my
self
alone.
And
to
be
sure
that
is
not
false
I
swear,
A
thousand
groans
but
thinking
on
thy
face,
One
on
another's
neck
do
witness
bear
Thy
black
is
fairest
in
my
judgment's
place.
In
nothing
art
thou
black
save
in
thy
deeds,
And
thence
this
slander
as
I
think
proceeds.

Thine
eyes
I
love,
and
they
as
pitying
me,
Knowing
thy
heart
torment
me
with
disdain,
Have
put
on
black,
and
loving
mourners
be,
Looking
with
pretty
ruth
upon
my
pain.
And
truly
not
the
morning
sun
of
heaven
Better
becomes
the
grey
cheeks
of
the
east,
Nor
that
full
star
that
ushers
in
the
even
Doth
half
that
glory
to
the
sober
west
As
those
two
mourning
eyes
become
thy
face:
O
let
it
then
as
well
beseem
thy
heart
To
mourn
for
me
since
mourning
doth
thee
grace,
And
suit
thy
pity
like
in
every
part.
Then
will
I
swear
beauty
herself
is
black,
And
all
they
foul
that
thy
complexion
lack.

Beshrew
that
heart
that
makes
my
heart
to
groan
For
that
deep
wound
it
gives
my
friend
and
me;
Is't
not
enough
to
torture
me
alone,
But
slave
to
slavery
my
sweet'st
friend
must
be?
Me
from
my
self
thy
cruel
eye
hath
taken,
And
my
next
self
thou
harder
hast
engrossed,
Of
him,
my
self,
and
thee
I
am
forsaken,
A
torment
thrice
three-fold
thus
to
be
crossed:
Prison
my
heart
in
thy
steel
bosom's
ward,
But
then
my
friend's
heart
let
my
poor
heart
bail,
Whoe'er
keeps
me,
let
my
heart
be
his
guard,
Thou
canst
not
then
use
rigour
in
my
gaol.
And
yet
thou
wilt,
for
I
being
pent
in
thee,
Perforce
am
thine
and
all
that
is
in
me.

So
now
I
have
confessed
that
he
is
thine,
And
I
my
self
am
mortgaged
to
thy
will,
My
self
I'll
forfeit,
so
that
other
mine,
Thou
wilt
restore
to
be
my
comfort
still:
But
thou
wilt
not,
nor
he
will
not
be
free,
For
thou
art
covetous,
and
he
is
kind,
He
learned
but
surety-like
to
write
for
me,
Under
that
bond
that
him
as
fist
doth
bind.
The
statute
of
thy
beauty
thou
wilt
take,
Thou
usurer
that
put'st
forth
all
to
use,
And
sue
a
friend,
came
debtor
for
my
sake,
So
him
I
lose
through
my
unkind
abuse.
Him
have
I
lost,
thou
hast
both
him
and
me,
He
pays
the
whole,
and
yet
am
I
not
free.

Whoever
hath
her
wish,
thou
hast
thy
will,
And
'Will'
to
boot,
and
'Will'
in
over-plus,
More
than
enough
am
I
that
vex
thee
still,
To
thy
sweet
will
making
addition
thus.
Wilt
thou
whose
will
is
large
and
spacious,
Not
once
vouchsafe
to
hide
my
will
in
thine?
Shall
will
in
others
seem
right
gracious,
And
in
my
will
no
fair
acceptance
shine?
The
sea
all
water,
yet
receives
rain
still,
And
in
abundance
addeth
to
his
store,
So
thou
being
rich
in
will
add
to
thy
will
One
will
of
mine
to
make
thy
large
will
more.
Let
no
unkind,
no
fair
beseechers
kill,
Think
all
but
one,
and
me
in
that
one
'Will.'

If
thy
soul
check
thee
that
I
come
so
near,
Swear
to
thy
blind
soul
that
I
was
thy
'Will',
And
will
thy
soul
knows
is
admitted
there,
Thus
far
for
love,
my
love-suit
sweet
fulfil.
'Will',
will
fulfil
the
treasure
of
thy
love,
Ay,
fill
it
full
with
wills,
and
my
will
one,
In
things
of
great
receipt
with
case
we
prove,
Among
a
number
one
is
reckoned
none.
Then
in
the
number
let
me
pass
untold,
Though
in
thy
store's
account
I
one
must
be,
For
nothing
hold
me,
so
it
please
thee
hold,
That
nothing
me,
a
something
sweet
to
thee.
Make
but
my
name
thy
love,
and
love
that
still,
And
then
thou
lov'st
me
for
my
name
is
Will.

Thou
blind
fool
Love,
what
dost
thou
to
mine
eyes,
That
they
behold
and
see
not
what
they
see?
They
know
what
beauty
is,
see
where
it
lies,
Yet
what
the
best
is,
take
the
worst
to
be.
If
eyes
corrupt
by
over-partial
looks,
Be
anchored
in
the
bay
where
all
men
ride,
Why
of
eyes'
falsehood
hast
thou
forged
hooks,
Whereto
the
judgment
of
my
heart
is
tied?
Why
should
my
heart
think
that
a
several
plot,
Which
my
heart
knows
the
wide
world's
common
place?
Or
mine
eyes
seeing
this,
say
this
is
not
To
put
fair
truth
upon
so
foul
a
face?
In
things
right
true
my
heart
and
eyes
have
erred,
And
to
this
false
plague
are
they
now
transferred.

When
my
love
swears
that
she
is
made
of
truth,
I
do
believe
her
though
I
know
she
lies,
That
she
might
think
me
some
untutored
youth,
Unlearned
in
the
world's
false
subtleties.
Thus
vainly
thinking
that
she
thinks
me
young,
Although
she
knows
my
days
are
past
the
best,
Simply
I
credit
her
false-speaking
tongue,
On
both
sides
thus
is
simple
truth
suppressed:
But
wherefore
says
she
not
she
is
unjust?
And
wherefore
say
not
I
that
I
am
old?
O
love's
best
habit
is
in
seeming
trust,
And
age
in
love,
loves
not
to
have
years
told.
Therefore
I
lie
with
her,
and
she
with
me,
And
in
our
faults
by
lies
we
flattered
be.

O
call
not
me
to
justify
the
wrong,
That
thy
unkindness
lays
upon
my
heart,
Wound
me
not
with
thine
eye
but
with
thy
tongue,
Use
power
with
power,
and
slay
me
not
by
art,
Tell
me
thou
lov'st
elsewhere;
but
in
my
sight,
Dear
heart
forbear
to
glance
thine
eye
aside,
What
need'st
thou
wound
with
cunning
when
thy
might
Is
more
than
my
o'erpressed
defence
can
bide?
Let
me
excuse
thee,
ah
my
love
well
knows,
Her
pretty
looks
have
been
mine
enemies,
And
therefore
from
my
face
she
turns
my
foes,
That
they
elsewhere
might
dart
their
injuries:
Yet
do
not
so,
but
since
I
am
near
slain,
Kill
me
outright
with
looks,
and
rid
my
pain.

Be
wise
as
thou
art
cruel,
do
not
press
My
tongue-tied
patience
with
too
much
disdain:
Lest
sorrow
lend
me
words
and
words
express,
The
manner
of
my
pity-wanting
pain.
If
I
might
teach
thee
wit
better
it
were,
Though
not
to
love,
yet
love
to
tell
me
so,
As
testy
sick
men
when
their
deaths
be
near,
No
news
but
health
from
their
physicians
know.
For
if
I
should
despair
I
should
grow
mad,
And
in
my
madness
might
speak
ill
of
thee,
Now
this
ill-wresting
world
is
grown
so
bad,
Mad
slanderers
by
mad
ears
believed
be.
That
I
may
not
be
so,
nor
thou
belied,
Bear
thine
eyes
straight,
though
thy
proud
heart
go
wide.

In
faith
I
do
not
love
thee
with
mine
eyes,
For
they
in
thee
a
thousand
errors
note,
But
'tis
my
heart
that
loves
what
they
despise,
Who
in
despite
of
view
is
pleased
to
dote.
Nor
are
mine
cars
with
thy
tongue's
tune
delighted,
Nor
tender
feeling
to
base
touches
prone,
Nor
taste,
nor
smell,
desire
to
be
invited
To
any
sensual
feast
with
thee
alone:
But
my
five
wits,
nor
my
five
senses
can
Dissuade
one
foolish
heart
from
serving
thee,
Who
leaves
unswayed
the
likeness
of
a
man,
Thy
proud
heart's
slave
and
vassal
wretch
to
be:
Only
my
plague
thus
far
I
count
my
gain,
That
she
that
makes
me
sin,
awards
me
pain.

Love
is
my
sin,
and
thy
dear
virtue
hate,
Hate
of
my
sin,
grounded
on
sinful
loving,
O
but
with
mine,
compare
thou
thine
own
state,
And
thou
shalt
find
it
merits
not
reproving,
Or
if
it
do,
not
from
those
lips
of
thine,
That
have
profaned
their
scarlet
ornaments,
And
sealed
false
bonds
of
love
as
oft
as
mine,
Robbed
others'
beds'
revenues
of
their
rents.
Be
it
lawful
I
love
thee
as
thou
lov'st
those,
Whom
thine
eyes
woo
as
mine
importune
thee,
Root
pity
in
thy
heart
that
when
it
grows,
Thy
pity
may
deserve
to
pitied
be.
If
thou
dost
seek
to
have
what
thou
dost
hide,
By
self-example
mayst
thou
be
denied.

Lo
as
a
careful
huswife
runs
to
catch,
One
of
her
feathered
creatures
broke
away,
Sets
down
her
babe
and
makes
all
swift
dispatch
In
pursuit
of
the
thing
she
would
have
stay:
Whilst
her
neglected
child
holds
her
in
chase,
Cries
to
catch
her
whose
busy
care
is
bent,
To
follow
that
which
flies
before
her
face:
Not
prizing
her
poor
infant's
discontent;
So
run'st
thou
after
that
which
flies
from
thee,
Whilst
I
thy
babe
chase
thee
afar
behind,
But
if
thou
catch
thy
hope
turn
back
to
me:
And
play
the
mother's
part,
kiss
me,
be
kind.
So
will
I
pray
that
thou
mayst
have
thy
Will,
If
thou
turn
back
and
my
loud
crying
still.

Two
loves
I
have
of
comfort
and
despair,
Which
like
two
spirits
do
suggest
me
still,
The
better
angel
is
a
man
right
fair:
The
worser
spirit
a
woman
coloured
ill.
To
win
me
soon
to
hell
my
female
evil,
Tempteth
my
better
angel
from
my
side,
And
would
corrupt
my
saint
to
be
a
devil:
Wooing
his
purity
with
her
foul
pride.
And
whether
that
my
angel
be
turned
fiend,
Suspect
I
may,
yet
not
directly
tell,
But
being
both
from
me
both
to
each
friend,
I
guess
one
angel
in
another's
hell.
Yet
this
shall
I
ne'er
know
but
live
in
doubt,
Till
my
bad
angel
fire
my
good
one
out.

Those
lips
that
Love's
own
hand
did
make,
Breathed
forth
the
sound
that
said
'I
hate',
To
me
that
languished
for
her
sake:
But
when
she
saw
my
woeful
state,
Straight
in
her
heart
did
mercy
come,
Chiding
that
tongue
that
ever
sweet,
Was
used
in
giving
gentle
doom:
And
taught
it
thus
anew
to
greet:
'I
hate'
she
altered
with
an
end,
That
followed
it
as
gentle
day,
Doth
follow
night
who
like
a
fiend
From
heaven
to
hell
is
flown
away.
'I
hate',
from
hate
away
she
threw,
And
saved
my
life
saying
'not
you'.

Poor
soul
the
centre
of
my
sinful
earth,
My
sinful
earth
these
rebel
powers
array,
Why
dost
thou
pine
within
and
suffer
dearth
Painting
thy
outward
walls
so
costly
gay?
Why
so
large
cost
having
so
short
a
lease,
Dost
thou
upon
thy
fading
mansion
spend?
Shall
worms
inheritors
of
this
excess
Eat
up
thy
charge?
is
this
thy
body's
end?
Then
soul
live
thou
upon
thy
servant's
loss,
And
let
that
pine
to
aggravate
thy
store;
Buy
terms
divine
in
selling
hours
of
dross;
Within
be
fed,
without
be
rich
no
more,
So
shall
thou
feed
on
death,
that
feeds
on
men,
And
death
once
dead,
there's
no
more
dying
then.

My
love
is
as
a
fever
longing
still,
For
that
which
longer
nurseth
the
disease,
Feeding
on
that
which
doth
preserve
the
ill,
Th'
uncertain
sickly
appetite
to
please:
My
reason
the
physician
to
my
love,
Angry
that
his
prescriptions
are
not
kept
Hath
left
me,
and
I
desperate
now
approve,
Desire
is
death,
which
physic
did
except.
Past
cure
I
am,
now
reason
is
past
care,
And
frantic-mad
with
evermore
unrest,
My
thoughts
and
my
discourse
as
mad
men's
are,
At
random
from
the
truth
vainly
expressed.
For
I
have
sworn
thee
fair,
and
thought
thee
bright,
Who
art
as
black
as
hell,
as
dark
as
night.

O
me!
what
eyes
hath
love
put
in
my
head,
Which
have
no
correspondence
with
true
sight,
Or
if
they
have,
where
is
my
judgment
fled,
That
censures
falsely
what
they
see
aright?
If
that
be
fair
whereon
my
false
eyes
dote,
What
means
the
world
to
say
it
is
not
so?
If
it
be
not,
then
love
doth
well
denote,
Love's
eye
is
not
so
true
as
all
men's:
no,
How
can
it?
O
how
can
love's
eye
be
true,
That
is
so
vexed
with
watching
and
with
tears?
No
marvel
then
though
I
mistake
my
view,
The
sun
it
self
sees
not,
till
heaven
clears.
O
cunning
love,
with
tears
thou
keep'st
me
blind,
Lest
eyes
well-seeing
thy
foul
faults
should
find.

Canst
thou
O
cruel,
say
I
love
thee
not,
When
I
against
my
self
with
thee
partake?
Do
I
not
think
on
thee
when
I
forgot
Am
of
my
self,
all-tyrant,
for
thy
sake?
Who
hateth
thee
that
I
do
call
my
friend,
On
whom
frown'st
thou
that
I
do
fawn
upon,
Nay
if
thou
lour'st
on
me
do
I
not
spend
Revenge
upon
my
self
with
present
moan?
What
merit
do
I
in
my
self
respect,
That
is
so
proud
thy
service
to
despise,
When
all
my
best
doth
worship
thy
defect,
Commanded
by
the
motion
of
thine
eyes?
But
love
hate
on
for
now
I
know
thy
mind,
Those
that
can
see
thou
lov'st,
and
I
am
blind.

O
from
what
power
hast
thou
this
powerful
might,
With
insufficiency
my
heart
to
sway,
To
make
me
give
the
lie
to
my
true
sight,
And
swear
that
brightness
doth
not
grace
the
day?
Whence
hast
thou
this
becoming
of
things
ill,
That
in
the
very
refuse
of
thy
deeds,
There
is
such
strength
and
warrantise
of
skill,
That
in
my
mind
thy
worst
all
best
exceeds?
Who
taught
thee
how
to
make
me
love
thee
more,
The
more
I
hear
and
see
just
cause
of
hate?
O
though
I
love
what
others
do
abhor,
With
others
thou
shouldst
not
abhor
my
state.
If
thy
unworthiness
raised
love
in
me,
More
worthy
I
to
be
beloved
of
thee.

Love
is
too
young
to
know
what
conscience
is,
Yet
who
knows
not
conscience
is
born
of
love?
Then
gentle
cheater
urge
not
my
amiss,
Lest
guilty
of
my
faults
thy
sweet
self
prove.
For
thou
betraying
me,
I
do
betray
My
nobler
part
to
my
gross
body's
treason,
My
soul
doth
tell
my
body
that
he
may,
Triumph
in
love,
flesh
stays
no
farther
reason,
But
rising
at
thy
name
doth
point
out
thee,
As
his
triumphant
prize,
proud
of
this
pride,
He
is
contented
thy
poor
drudge
to
be,
To
stand
in
thy
affairs,
fall
by
thy
side.
No
want
of
conscience
hold
it
that
I
call,
Her
love,
for
whose
dear
love
I
rise
and
fall.

In
loving
thee
thou
know'st
I
am
forsworn,
But
thou
art
twice
forsworn
to
me
love
swearing,
In
act
thy
bed-vow
broke
and
new
faith
torn,
In
vowing
new
hate
after
new
love
bearing:
But
why
of
two
oaths'
breach
do
I
accuse
thee,
When
I
break
twenty?
I
am
perjured
most,
For
all
my
vows
are
oaths
but
to
misuse
thee:
And
all
my
honest
faith
in
thee
is
lost.
For
I
have
sworn
deep
oaths
of
thy
deep
kindness:
Oaths
of
thy
love,
thy
truth,
thy
constancy,
And
to
enlighten
thee
gave
eyes
to
blindness,
Or
made
them
swear
against
the
thing
they
see.
For
I
have
sworn
thee
fair:
more
perjured
I,
To
swear
against
the
truth
so
foul
a
be.

Cupid
laid
by
his
brand
and
fell
asleep,
A
maid
of
Dian's
this
advantage
found,
And
his
love-kindling
fire
did
quickly
steep
In
a
cold
valley-fountain
of
that
ground:
Which
borrowed
from
this
holy
fire
of
Love,
A
dateless
lively
heat
still
to
endure,
And
grew
a
seeting
bath
which
yet
men
prove,
Against
strange
maladies
a
sovereign
cure:
But
at
my
mistress'
eye
Love's
brand
new-fired,
The
boy
for
trial
needs
would
touch
my
breast,
I
sick
withal
the
help
of
bath
desired,
And
thither
hied
a
sad
distempered
guest.
But
found
no
cure,
the
bath
for
my
help
lies,
Where
Cupid
got
new
fire;
my
mistress'
eyes.

The
little
Love-god
lying
once
asleep,
Laid
by
his
side
his
heart-inflaming
brand,
Whilst
many
nymphs
that
vowed
chaste
life
to
keep,
Came
tripping
by,
but
in
her
maiden
hand,
The
fairest
votary
took
up
that
fire,
Which
many
legions
of
true
hearts
had
warmed,
And
so
the
general
of
hot
desire,
Was
sleeping
by
a
virgin
hand
disarmed.
This
brand
she
quenched
in
a
cool
well
by,
Which
from
Love's
fire
took
heat
perpetual,
Growing
a
bath
and
healthful
remedy,
For
men
discased,
but
I
my
mistress'
thrall,
Came
there
for
cure
and
this
by
that
I
prove,
Love's
fire
heats
water,
water
cools
not
love.

In

his
physicians
madam
under
whose
practices
he
hath
persecuted
time
with
hope
and
finds
no
other
advantage
in
the
process
but
only
the
losing
of
hope
by
time
This
young
gentlewoman
had
a
father
that
had
how
sad
a
passage
tiswhose
skill
was
almost
as
great
as
his
honesty
had
it
stretchd
so
far
would
have
made
nature
immortal
and
death
should
have
play
for
lack
of
work
Would
for
the
Kings
sake
he
were
living
I
think
it
would
be
the
death
of
the
Kings
disease
How
calld
you
the
man
you
speak
of
madam
He
was
famous
sir
in
his
profession
and
it
was
his
great
right
to
be
so
Gerard
de
Narbon
He
was
excellent
indeed
madam
the
King
very
lately
spoke
of
him
admiringly
and
mourningly
he
was
skilful
enough
to
have
livd
still
if
knowledge
could
be
set
up
against
mortality
What
is
it
my
good
lord
the
King
languishes
of
fistula
my
lord
I
heard
not
of
it
before
I
would
it
were
not
notorious
Was
this
gentlewoman
the
daughter
of
Gerard
de
Narbon
His
sole
child
my
lord
and
bequeathed
to
my
overlooking
I
have
those
hopes
of
her
good
that
her
education
promises
her
dispositions
she
inherits
which
makes
fair
gifts
fairer
for
where
an
unclean
mind
carries
virtuous
qualities
there
commendations
go
with
pitythey
are
virtues
and
traitors
too
In
her
they
are
the
better
for
their
simpleness
she
derives
her
honesty
and
achieves
her
goodness
Your
commendations
madam
get
from
her
tears
Tis
the
best
brine
a
maiden
can
season
her
praise
in
The
remembrance
of
her
father
never
approaches
her
heart
but
the
tyranny
of
her
sorrows
takes
all
livelihood
from
her
cheek
No
more
of
this
Helena
go
to
no
more
lest
it
be
rather
thought
you
affect
a
sorrow
than
to
have
I
do
affect
a
sorrow
indeed
but
I
have
it
too
Moderate
lamentation
is
the
right
of
the
dead
excessive
grief
the
enemy
to
the
living
If
the
living
be
enemy
to
the
grief
the
excess
makes
it
soon
mortal
Madam
I
desire
your
holy
wishes
How
understand
we
that
Be
thou
blest
Bertram
and
succeed
thy
father
In
manners
as
in
shape
Thy
blood
and
virtue
Contend
for
empire
in
thee
and
thy
goodness
Share
with
thy
birthright
Love
all
trust
a
few
Do
wrong
to
none
be
able
for
thine
enemy
Rather
in
power
than
use
and
keep
thy
friend
Under
thy
own
lifes
key
be
checkd
for
silence
But
never
taxd
for
speech
What
heaven
more
will
That
thee
may
furnish
and
my
prayers
pluck
down
Fall
on
thy
head
Farewell
My
lord
Tis
an
unseasond
courtier
good
my
lord
Advise
him
He
cannot
want
the
best
That
shall
attend
his
love
Heaven
bless
him
Farewell
Bertram
The
best
wishes
that
can
be
forgd
in
your
thoughts
be
servants
to
you
To
Be
comfortable
to
my
mother
your
mistress
and
make
much
of
her
Farewell
pretty
lady
you
must
hold
the
credit
of
your
father
were
that
all
I
think
not
on
my
father
And
these
great
tears
grace
his
remembrance
more
Than
those
I
shed
for
him
What
was
he
like
I
have
forgot
him
my
imagination
Carries
no
favour
int
but
Bertrams
I
am
undone
there
is
no
living
none
If
Bertram
be
away
Twere
all
one
That
I
should
love
a
bright
particular
star
And
think
to
wed
it
he
is
so
above
me
In
his
bright
radiance
and
collateral
light
Must
I
be
comforted
not
in
his
sphere
Th
ambition
in
my
love
thus
plagues
itself
The
hind
that
would
be
mated
by
the
lion
Must
die
for
love
Twas
pretty
though
a
plague
To
see
him
every
hour
to
sit
and
draw
His
arched
brows
his
hawking
eye
his
curls
In
our
hearts
tableheart
too
capable
Of
every
line
and
trick
of
his
sweet
favour
But
now
hes
gone
and
my
idolatrous
fancy
Must
sanctify
his
relics
Who
comes
here
Enter
Aside
One
that
goes
with
him
I
love
him
for
his
sake
And
yet
I
know
him
a
notorious
liar
Think
him
a
great
way
fool
solely
a
coward
Yet
these
fixd
evils
sit
so
fit
in
him
That
they
take
place
when
virtues
steely
bones
Looks
bleak
i
th
cold
wind
withal
full
oft
we
see
Cold
wisdom
waiting
on
superfluous
folly
Save
you
fair
queen
And
you
monarch
No
And
no
Are
you
meditating
on
virginity
Ay
You
have
some
stain
of
soldier
in
you
let
me
ask
you
a
question
Man
is
enemy
to
virginity
how
may
we
barricado
it
against
him
Keep
him
out
But
he
assails
and
our
virginity
though
valiant
in
the
defence
yet
is
weak
Unfold
to
us
some
warlike
resistance
There
is
none
Man
setting
down
before
you
will
undermine
you
and
blow
you
up
Bless
our
poor
virginity
from
underminers
and
blowersup
Is
there
no
military
policy
how
virgins
might
blow
up
men
Virginity
being
blown
down
man
will
quicklier
be
blown
up
marry
in
blowing
him
down
again
with
the
breach
yourselves
made
you
lose
your
city
It
is
not
politic
in
the
commonwealth
of
nature
to
preserve
virginity
Loss
of
virginity
is
rational
increase
and
there
was
never
virgin
got
till
virginity
was
first
lost
That
you
were
made
of
is
metal
to
make
virgins
Virginity
by
being
once
lost
may
be
ten
times
found
by
being
ever
kept
it
is
ever
lost
Tis
too
cold
a
companion
away
witht
I
will
stand
for
t
a
little
though
therefore
I
die
a
virgin
Theres
little
can
be
said
in
t
tis
against
the
rule
of
nature
To
speak
on
the
part
of
virginity
is
to
accuse
your
mothers
which
is
most
infallible
disobedience
He
that
hangs
himself
is
a
virgin
virginity
murders
itself
and
should
be
buried
in
highways
out
of
all
sanctified
limit
as
a
desperate
offendress
against
nature
Virginity
breeds
mites
much
like
a
cheese
consumes
itself
to
the
very
paring
and
so
dies
with
feeding
his
own
stomach
Besides
virginity
is
peevish
proud
idle
made
of
selflove
which
is
the
most
inhibited
sin
in
the
canon
Keep
it
not
you
cannot
choose
but
lose
byt
Out
witht
Within
ten
year
it
will
make
itself
ten
which
is
a
goodly
increase
and
the
principal
itself
not
much
the
worse
Away
witht
How
might
one
do
sir
to
lose
it
to
her
own
liking
Let
me
see
Marry
ill
to
like
him
that
neer
it
likes
Tis
a
commodity
will
lose
the
gloss
with
lying
the
longer
kept
the
less
worth
Off
witht
while
tis
vendible
answer
the
time
of
request
Virginity
like
an
old
courtier
wears
her
cap
out
of
fashion
richly
suited
but
unsuitable
just
like
the
brooch
and
the
toothpick
which
wear
not
now
Your
date
is
better
in
your
pie
and
your
porridge
than
in
your
cheek
And
your
virginity
your
old
virginity
is
like
one
of
our
French
witherd
pears
it
looks
ill
it
eats
drily
marry
tis
a
witherd
pear
it
was
formerly
better
marry
yet
tis
a
witherd
pear
Will
you
anything
with
it
Not
my
virginity
yet
There
shall
your
master
have
a
thousand
loves
mother
and
a
mistress
and
a
friend
phoenix
captain
and
an
enemy
guide
a
goddess
and
a
sovereign
counsellor
a
traitress
and
a
dear
His
humble
ambition
proud
humility
His
jarring
concord
and
his
discord
dulcet
His
faith
his
sweet
disaster
with
a
world
Of
pretty
fond
adoptious
christendoms
That
blinking
Cupid
gossips
Now
shall
he
I
know
not
what
he
shall
God
send
him
well
The
courts
a
learningplace
and
he
is
one
What
one
i
faith
That
I
wish
well
Tis
pity
Whats
pity
That
wishing
well
had
not
a
body
int
Which
might
be
felt
that
we
the
poorer
born
Whose
baser
stars
do
shut
us
up
in
wishes
Might
with
effects
of
them
follow
our
friends
And
show
what
we
alone
must
think
which
never
Returns
us
thanks
Enter
Monsieur
Parolles
my
lord
calls
for
you
Little
Helen
farewell
if
I
can
remember
thee
I
will
think
of
thee
at
court
Monsieur
Parolles
you
were
born
under
a
charitable
star
Under
Mars
I
I
especially
think
under
Mars
Why
under
Man
The
wars
hath
so
kept
you
under
that
you
must
needs
be
born
under
Mars
When
he
was
predominant
When
he
was
retrograde
I
think
rather
Why
think
you
so
You
go
so
much
backward
when
you
fight
Thats
for
advantage
So
is
running
away
when
fear
proposes
the
safety
but
the
composition
that
your
valour
and
fear
makes
in
you
is
a
virtue
of
a
good
wing
and
I
like
the
wear
well
I
am
so
full
of
business
I
cannot
answer
thee
acutely
I
will
return
perfect
courtier
in
the
which
my
instruction
shall
serve
to
naturalize
thee
so
thou
wilt
be
capable
of
a
courtiers
counsel
and
understand
what
advice
shall
thrust
upon
thee
else
thou
diest
in
thine
unthankfulness
and
thine
ignorance
makes
thee
away
Farewell
When
thou
hast
leisure
say
thy
prayers
when
thou
hast
none
remember
thy
friends
Get
thee
a
good
husband
and
use
him
as
he
uses
thee
So
farewell
Our
remedies
oft
in
ourselves
do
lie
Which
we
ascribe
to
heaven
The
fated
sky
Gives
us
free
scope
only
doth
backward
pull
Our
slow
designs
when
we
ourselves
are
dull
What
power
is
it
which
mounts
my
love
so
high
That
makes
me
see
and
cannot
feed
mine
eye
The
mightiest
space
in
fortune
nature
brings
To
join
like
likes
and
kiss
like
native
things
Impossible
be
strange
attempts
to
those
That
weigh
their
pains
in
sense
and
do
suppose
What
hath
been
cannot
be
Who
ever
strove
To
show
her
merit
that
did
miss
her
love
The
Kings
diseasemy
project
may
deceive
me
But
my
intents
are
fixd
and
will
not
leave
me
I
Paris
The
palace
Flourish
of
cornets
Enter
the
with
letters
and
divers
The
Florentines
and
Senoys
are
by
th
ears
Have
fought
with
equal
fortune
and
continue
braving
war
So
tis
reported
sir
Nay
tis
most
credible
We
here
receive
it
certainty
vouchd
from
our
cousin
Austria
With
caution
that
the
Florentine
will
move
us
For
speedy
aid
wherein
our
dearest
friend
Prejudicates
the
business
and
would
seem
To
have
us
make
denial
His
love
and
wisdom
Approvd
so
to
your
Majesty
may
plead
For
amplest
credence
He
hath
armd
our
answer
And
Florence
is
denied
before
he
comes
Yet
for
our
gentlemen
that
mean
to
see
The
Tuscan
service
freely
have
they
leave
To
stand
on
either
part
It
well
may
serve
nursery
to
our
gentry
who
are
sick
For
breathing
and
exploit
Whats
he
comes
here
Enter
and
It
is
the
Count
Rousillon
my
good
lord
Young
Bertram
Youth
thou
bearst
thy
fathers
face
Frank
nature
rather
curious
than
in
haste
Hath
well
composd
thee
Thy
fathers
moral
parts
Mayst
thou
inherit
too
Welcome
to
Paris
My
thanks
and
duty
are
your
Majestys
I
would
I
had
that
corporal
soundness
now
As
when
thy
father
and
myself
in
friendship
First
tried
our
soldiership
He
did
look
far
Into
the
service
of
the
time
and
was
Discipled
of
the
bravest
He
lasted
long
But
on
us
both
did
haggish
age
steal
on
And
wore
us
out
of
act
It
much
repairs
me
To
talk
of
your
good
father
In
his
youth
He
had
the
wit
which
I
can
well
observe
Today
in
our
young
lords
but
they
may
jest
Till
their
own
scorn
return
to
them
unnoted
Ere
they
can
hide
their
levity
in
honour
So
like
a
courtier
contempt
nor
bitterness
Were
in
his
pride
or
sharpness
if
they
were
His
equal
had
awakd
them
and
his
honour
Clock
to
itself
knew
the
true
minute
when
Exception
bid
him
speak
and
at
this
time
His
tongue
obeyd
his
hand
Who
were
below
him
He
usd
as
creatures
of
another
place
And
bowd
his
eminent
top
to
their
low
ranks
Making
them
proud
of
his
humility
In
their
poor
praise
he
humbled
Such
a
man
Might
be
a
copy
to
these
younger
times
Which
followed
well
would
demonstrate
them
now
But
goers
backward
His
good
remembrance
sir
Lies
richer
in
your
thoughts
than
on
his
tomb
So
in
approof
lives
not
his
epitaph
As
in
your
royal
speech
Would
I
were
with
him
He
would
always
say
Methinks
I
hear
him
now
his
plausive
words
He
scatterd
not
in
ears
but
grafted
them
To
grow
there
and
to
bear
Let
me
not
live
This
his
good
melancholy
oft
began
On
the
catastrophe
and
heel
of
pastime
When
it
was
outLet
me
not
live
quoth
he
After
my
flame
lacks
oil
to
be
the
snuff
Of
younger
spirits
whose
apprehensive
senses
All
but
new
things
disdain
whose
judgments
are
Mere
fathers
of
their
garments
whose
constancies
Expire
before
their
fashions
This
he
wishd
I
after
him
do
after
him
wish
too
Since
I
nor
wax
nor
honey
can
bring
home
I
quickly
were
dissolved
from
my
hive
To
give
some
labourers
room
Youre
loved
sir
They
that
least
lend
it
you
shall
lack
you
first
I
fill
a
place
I
knowt
How
long
ist
Count
Since
the
physician
at
your
fathers
died
He
was
much
famd
Some
six
months
since
my
lord
If
he
were
living
I
would
try
him
yet
Lend
me
an
armthe
rest
have
worn
me
out
With
several
applications
Nature
and
sickness
Debate
it
at
their
leisure
Welcome
Count
My
sons
no
dearer
Thank
your
Majesty
I
Rousillon
The
palace
Enter
and
I
will
now
hear
what
say
you
of
this
gentlewoman
Madam
the
care
I
have
had
to
even
your
content
I
wish
might
be
found
in
the
calendar
of
my
past
endeavours
for
then
we
wound
our
modesty
and
make
foul
the
clearness
of
our
deservings
when
of
ourselves
we
publish
them
What
does
this
knave
here
Get
you
gone
sirrah
The
complaints
I
have
heard
of
you
I
do
not
all
believe
tis
my
slowness
that
I
do
not
for
I
know
you
lack
not
folly
to
commit
them
and
have
ability
enough
to
make
such
knaveries
yours
Tis
not
unknown
to
you
madam
I
am
a
poor
fellow
Well
sir
No
madam
tis
not
so
well
that
I
am
poor
though
many
of
the
rich
are
damnd
but
if
I
may
have
your
ladyships
good
will
to
go
to
the
world
Isbel
the
woman
and
I
will
do
as
we
may
Wilt
thou
needs
be
a
beggar
I
do
beg
your
good
will
in
this
case
In
what
case
In
Isbels
case
and
mine
own
Service
is
no
heritage
and
I
think
I
shall
never
have
the
blessing
of
God
till
I
have
issue
o
my
body
for
they
say
bames
are
blessings
Tell
me
thy
reason
why
thou
wilt
marry
My
poor
body
madam
requires
it
I
am
driven
on
by
the
flesh
and
he
must
needs
go
that
the
devil
drives
Is
this
all
your
worships
reason
Faith
madam
I
have
other
holy
reasons
such
as
they
are
May
the
world
know
them
I
have
been
madam
a
wicked
creature
as
you
and
all
flesh
and
blood
are
and
indeed
I
do
marry
that
I
may
repent
Thy
marriage
sooner
than
thy
wickedness
I
am
out
o
friends
madam
and
I
hope
to
have
friends
for
my
wifes
sake
Such
friends
are
thine
enemies
knave
Yare
shallow
madamin
great
friends
for
the
knaves
come
to
do
that
for
me
which
I
am
aweary
of
He
that
ears
my
land
spares
my
team
and
gives
me
leave
to
in
the
crop
If
I
be
his
cuckold
hes
my
drudge
He
that
comforts
my
wife
is
the
cherisher
of
my
flesh
and
blood
he
that
cherishes
my
flesh
and
blood
loves
my
flesh
and
blood
he
that
loves
my
flesh
and
blood
is
my
friend
ergo
he
that
kisses
my
wife
is
my
friend
If
men
could
be
contented
to
be
what
they
are
there
were
no
fear
in
marriage

That

make
title
to
as

love
as
she

There
is
more
owing
her
than

more
shall
be

than

Madam
I
was
very
late
more
near
her
than
I
think
she
wishd
me
Alone
she
was
and
did
communicate
to
herself
her
own
words
to
her
own
ears
she
thought
I
dare
vow
for
her
they
touchd
not
any
stranger
sense
Her
matter
was
she
loved
your
son
Fortune
she
said
was
no
goddess
that
had
put
such
difference
betwixt
their
two
estates
Love
no
god
that
would
not
extend
his
might
only
where
qualities
were
level
Diana
no
queen
of
virgins
that
would
suffer
her
poor
knight
surprisd
without
rescue
in
the
first
assault
or
ransom
afterward
This
she
deliverd
in
the
most
bitter
touch
of
sorrow
that
eer
I
heard
virgin
exclaim
in
which
I
held
my
duty
speedily
to
acquaint
you
withal
sithence
in
the
loss
that
may
happen
it
concerns
you
something

Many
likelihoods
informd
me
of
this
before
which
hung
so
tottring
in
the
balance
that
I
could
neither
believe
nor
misdoubt
Pray

Stall

in
your
bosom

your
honest

Our

It
is
the
show
and
seal
of

Where
loves
strong
passion
is
impressd
in
youth
By
our
remembrances
of
days
foregone
Such
were
our
faults

Why

That

So

Indeed

Or

Against

That

And

That

Speak

If

howeer
I

As

To

Good

Do

Your

noble

Love

Do

madam
Go

int
a
bond
Whereof
the
world
takes
note
Come
come

The
state
of
your
affection
for
your
passions
Have
to
the
full
appeachd
Then
I
confess
Here
on
my
knee
before
high
heaven
and
you
That
before
you
and
next
unto
high
heaven
I
love
your
son
My
friends
were
poor
but
honest
sos
my
love
Be
not
offended
for
it
hurts
not
him
That
he
is
lovd
of
me
I
follow
him
not
By
any
token
of
presumptuous
suit
Nor
would
I
have
him
till
I
do
deserve
him
Yet
never
know
how
that
desert
should
be
I
know
I
love
in
vain
strive
against
hope
Yet
in
this
captious
and
intenible
sieve
I
still
pour
in
the
waters
of
my
love
And
lack
not
to
lose
still
Thus
Indianlike
Religious
in
mine
error
I
adore
The
sun
that
looks
upon
his
worshipper
But
knows
of
him
no
more
My
dearest
madam
Let
not
your
hate
encounter
with
my
love
For
loving
where
you
do
but
if
yourself
Whose
aged
honour
cites
a
virtuous
youth
Did
ever
in
so
true
a
flame
of
liking
Wish
chastely
and
love
dearly
that
your
Dian
Was
both
herself
and
Love
then
give
pity
To
her
whose
state
is
such
that
cannot
choose
But
lend
and
give
where
she
is
sure
to
lose
That
seeks
not
to
find
that
her
search
implies
But
riddlelike
lives
sweetly
where
she
dies
Had
you
not
lately
an
intentspeak
truly
To
go
to
Paris
Madam
I
had
Wherefore
Tell
true
I
will
tell
truth
by
grace
itself
I
swear
You
know
my
father
left
me
some
prescriptions
Of
rare
and
provd
effects
such
as
his
reading
And
manifest
experience
had
collected
For
general
sovereignty
and
that
he
willd
me
In
heedfullst
reservation
to
bestow
them
As
notes
whose
faculties
inclusive
were
More
than
they
were
in
note
Amongst
the
rest
There
is
a
remedy
approvd
set
down
To
cure
the
desperate
languishings
whereof
The
King
is
renderd
lost
This
was
your
motive
For
Paris
was
it
Speak
My
lord
your
son
made
me
to
think
of
this
Else
Paris
and
the
medicine
and
the
King
Had
from

my
thoughts
Haply

absent
then
But
think
you
Helen
If
you

tender
your
supposed
aid
He
would
receive
it
He
and
his
physicians
Are
of
a
mind
he
that
they
cannot
help
him
They
that
they
cannot
help
How
shall
they
credit
poor
unlearned
virgin
when
the
schools
Embowelld
of
their
doctrine
have
let
off
The
danger
to
itself
Theres
something
int
More
than
my
fathers
skill
which
was
the
greatst
Of
his
profession
that
his
good
receipt
Shall
for
my
legacy
be
sanctified
By
th
luckiest
stars
in
heaven
and
would
your
honour
But
give
me
leave
to
try
success
Id
venture
The
welllost
life
of
mine
on
his
Graces
cure
By
such
a
day
and
hour
Dost
thou
believet
Ay

Be

Quicken

and
make
you
dance
canary
With
spritely
fire
and
motion
whose
simple

Is
powerful
to
araise
King
Pepin
nay
To
give

Charlemain
a
pen
ins

And
write
to

a
loveline
What
her
is
this
Why
Doctor
She
My
lord
theres

arrivd
If
you
will
see
her
Now
by
my
faith
and
honour
If
seriously
I
may
convey
my
thoughts
In
this
my
light
deliverance
I
have
spoke
With
one
that
in
her
sex
her
years
profession
Wisdom
and
constancy
hath
amazd
me
more
Than
I
dare
blame
my
weakness
Will
you
see
her
For
that
is
her
demand
and
know
her
business
That
done
laugh
well
at
me
Now
good
Lafeu
Bring
in
the
admiration
that
we
with
the
May
spend
our
wonder
too
or
take
off
thine
By
wondring
how
thou
tookst
it
Nay
Ill
fit
you
And
not
be

Thus

Reenter

Nay
come
your
ways
This
haste
hath
wings
indeed
Nay
come
your
ways
This
is
his
Majesty
say
your
mind
to
him
traitor
you
do
look
like
but
such
traitors
His
Majesty
seldom
fears
I
am
Cressids
uncle
That
dare
leave
two
together
Fare
you
well
Now
fair
one
does
your
business
follow
us
Ay
my
good
lord
Gerard
de
Narbon
was
my
father
In
what
he
did
profess
well
found
I
knew
him
The
rather
will
I
spare
my
praises
towards
him
Knowing
him
is
enough
Ons
bed
of
death
Many
receipts
he
gave
me
chiefly
one
Which
as
the
dearest
issue
of
his
practice
And
of
his
old
experience
th
only
darling
He
bade
me
store
up
as
a
triple
eye
Safer
than
mine
own
two
more
dear
I
have
so
And
hearing
your
high
Majesty
is
touchd
With
that
malignant
cause
wherein
the
honour
Of
my
dear
fathers
gift
stands
chief
in
power
I
come
to
tender
it
and
my
appliance
With
all
bound
humbleness
We
thank
you
maiden
But
may
not
be
so
credulous
of
cure
When
our
most
learned
doctors
leave
us
and
The
congregated
college
have
concluded
That
labouring
art
can
never
ransom
nature
From
her
inaidable
estateI
say
we
must
not
So
stain
our
judgment
or
corrupt
our
hope
To
prostitute
our
pastcure
malady
To
empirics
or
to
dissever
so
Our
great
self
and
our
credit
to
esteem
senseless
help
when
help
past
sense
we
deem
My
duty
then
shall
pay
me
for
my
pains
I
will
no
more
enforce
mine
office
on
you
Humbly
entreating
from
your
royal
thoughts
modest
one
to
bear
me
back
again
I
cannot
give
thee
less
to
be
calld
grateful
Thou
thoughtst
to
help
me
and
such
thanks
I
give
As
one
near
death
to

what
at

I

thou
knowst
no

I
knowing

thou
no

What
I
can
do
can
do
no

to

Since
you
set
up
your

gainst
remedy
He
that
of
greatest
works
is
finisher
Oft
does
them
by
the
weakest
minister
So
holy
writ
in
babes
hath
judgment
shown
When
judges
have
been
babes
Great
floods
have
flown
From
simple
sources
and
great
seas
have
dried
When
miracles
have
by
the
greatest
been
denied
Oft
expectation
fails
and
most
oft
there
Where
most
it
promises
and
oft
it
hits
Where
hope
is
coldest
and
despair
most
fits
I
must
not
hear
thee
Fare
thee
well
kind

Thy

not

by

Proffers
not

It
is
not
so
with
Him
that
all
things
knows
As
tis
with
us
that
square
our
guess
by
shows
But
most
it
is
presumption
in
us
when
The

of
heaven
we
count
the

of

Dear
sir
to
my

give
consent
Of

not

I
am
not
an

that
proclaim
Myself
against

of
mine

But
know
I
think
and
think
I
know
most
sure
My

not

Art
thou

Within

Come

sir
I
shall
now
put
you
to
the

of
your

I
will
show
myself
highly
fed
and
lowly

I
know
my
business
is
but
to
the
court
To
the
court
Why
what
place
make
you
special
when
you
put
off
that
with
such
contempt
But
to
the
court
Truly
madam
if
God
have
lent
a
man
any
manners
he
may
easily
put
it
off
at
court
He
that
cannot
make

put

and
say
nothing

neither

nor

and
indeed
such
a
fellow
to
say
precisely
were
not
for
the
court
but
for
me
I
have
an
answer
will
serve
all
men
Marry
thats
a
bountiful
answer
that
fits
all
questions
It
is
like
a
barbers
chair
that
fits
all
buttocksthe
pin
buttock
the
quatch
buttock
the
brawn
buttock
or
any
buttock
Will
your
answer
serve
fit
to
all
questions
As
fit
as
ten
groats
is
for
the
hand
of
an
attorney
as
your
French
crown
for
your
taffety
punk
as
Tibs

as

for

for

as

as

quean
to
a
wrangling
knave
as
the
nuns
lip
to
the
friars
mouth
nay
as
the
pudding
to
his
skin
Have
you
I
say
an
answer
of
such
fitness
for
all
questions
From
below
your
duke
to
beneath
your
constable
it
will
fit
any
question
It
must
be
an
answer
of
most
monstrous
size
that
must
fit
all
demands
But
a
trifle
neither
in
good
faith
if
the
learned
should
speak
truth
of
it
Here
it
is
and
all
that
belongs
tot
Ask
me
if
I
am
a

it
shall
do
you
no
harm
to

To
be

again
if
we
could
I
will
be
a
fool
in

hoping
to
be
the
wiser
by
your
answer
I
pray
you
sir
are
you
a
courtier
Lord

a
simple
putting
off
More
more
a
hundred
of

Sir
I
am
a
poor
friend
of
yours
that

Lord

I

Lord

you
You

sir
as
I

Lord
sirSpare
not

Do
you
cry
Lord
sir
at
your
whipping
and
spare
not
me
Indeed
your
Lord
sir
is
very
sequent
to
your
whipping
You
would
answer
very
well
to
a
whipping
if
you
were
but
bound
tot
I
neer
had
worse
luck
in
my
life
in
my
Lord
sir
I
see
things
may
serve
long
but
not
serve
ever
I
play
the
noble
housewife
with
the
time
To
entertain
it
so
merrily
with
a
fool
Lord
sirWhy
theret
serves
well
again
An
end
sir
To
your
business
give
Helen
this
And
urge
her
to
a
present
answer
back
Commend
me
to
my
kinsmen
and
my
son
This
is
not
much
Not
much
commendation
to
them
Not
much
employment
for
you
You
understand
me
Most
fruitfully
I
am
there
before
my
legs
Haste
you
again
Paris
The
palace
Enter
and
They
say
miracles
are
past
and
we
have
our
philosophical
persons
to
make
modern
and
familiar
things
supernatural
and
causeless
Hence
is
it
that
we
make
trifles
of
terrors
ensconcing
ourselves
into
seeming
knowledge
when
we
should
submit
ourselves
to
an
unknown
fear
Why
tis
the
rarest
argument
of
wonder
that
hath
shot
out
in
our
latter
times
And
so
tis
To
be
relinquishd
of
the
artists
So
I
sayboth
of
Galen
and
Paracelsus
Of
all
the
learned
and
authentic
fellows
Right
so
I
say
That
gave
him
out
incurable
Why
there
tis
so
say
I
too
Not
to
be
helpd
Right
as
twere
a
man
assurd
of
a
Uncertain
life
and
sure
death
Just
you
say
well
so
would
I
have
said
I
may
truly
say
it
is
a
novelty
to
the
world
It
is
indeed
If
you
will
have
it
in
showing
you
shall
read
it
in
whatdoyecallt
here
Reading
the
ballad
title
Showing
of
a
Heavenly
Effect
in
an
Earthly
Actor
Thats
it
I
would
have
said
the
very
same
Why
your
dolphin
is
not
lustier
Fore
me
I
speak
in
respect
Nay
tis
strange
tis
very
strange
that
is
the
brief
and
the
tedious
of
it
and
hes
of
a
most
facinerious
spirit
that
will
not
acknowledge
it
to
be
the
Very
hand
of
heaven
Ay
so
I
say
In
a
most
weak
And
debile
minister
great
power
great
transcendence
which
should
indeed
give
us
a
further
use
to
be
made
than
alone
the
recovry
of
the
King
as
to
be
Generally
thankful
Enter
and
I
would
have
said
it
you
say
well
Here
comes
the
King
Lustig
as
the
Dutchman
says
Ill
like
a
maid
the
better
whilst
I
have
a
tooth
in
my
head
Why
hes
able
to
lead
her
a
coranto
Mort
du
vinaigre
Is
not
this
Helen
Fore
God
I
think
so
Go
call
before
me
all
the
lords
in
court
Sit
my
preserver
by
thy
patients
side
And
with
this
healthful
hand
whose
banishd
sense
Thou
has
repeald
a
second
time
receive
The
confirmation
of
my
promisd
gift
Which
but
attends
thy
naming
Enter
three
or
four
Fair
maid

forth
thine
eye
This
youthful
parcel
Of
noble
bachelors
stand
at
my
bestowing
Oer
whom
both
sovereign
power
and
fathers
voice
I
have
to
use
Thy
frank
election

Thou
hast
power
to
choose
and
they
none
to
forsake
To
each
of
you
one
fair
and
virtuous
mistress
Fall

Marry
to
each
but
one
Id
give

Curtal

his
furniture
My
mouth
no
more
were
broken
than
these
boys
And
writ
as
little

Peruse
them
well
Not
one
of
those
but
had
a
noble
father
Gentlemen
Heaven
hath
through
me
restord
the
King
to
health
We
understand
it
and
thank
heaven
for
you
I
am
a
simple
maid
and
therein
wealthiest
That
I
protest
I
simply
am
a
maid
Please
it
your
Majesty
I
have
done
already
The
blushes
in
my
cheeks
thus
whisper
me
We
blush
that
thou
shouldst
choose
but
be
refused
Let
the
white
death
sit
on
thy
cheek
for
ever
Well
neer
come
there
again
Make
choice
and
see
Who
shuns
thy
love
shuns
all
his
love
in
me
Now
Dian
from
thy
altar
do
I
fly
And
to
imperial
Love
that
god
most
high
Do
my
sighs
stream
Sir
will
you
hear
my
suit
And
grant
it
Thanks
sir
all
the
rest
is
mute
I
had
rather
be
in
this
choice
than
throw
amesace
for
my
life
The
honour
sir
that
flames
in
your
fair
eyes
Before
I
speak
too
threatningly
replies
Love
make
your
fortunes
twenty
times
above
Her
that
so
wishes
and
her
humble
love
No
better
if
you
please
My
wish
receive
Which
great
Love
grant
and
so
I
take
my
leave
Do
all
they
deny
her
An
they
were
sons
of
mine
Id
have
them
whipt
or
I
would
send
them
to
th
Turk
to
make
eunuchs
of
Be
not
afraid
that
I
your
hand
should
take
Ill
never
do
you
wrong
for
your
own
sake
Blessing
upon
your
vows
and
in
your
bed
Find
fairer
fortune
if
you
ever
wed
These
boys
are
boys
of
ice
theyll
none
have
her
Sure
they
are
bastards
to
the
English
the
French
neer
got
em
You
are
too
young
too
happy
and
too
good
To
make
yourself
a
son
out
of
my
blood
Fair
one
I
think
not
so
Theres
one
grape
yet
I
am
sure
thy
father
drunk
winebut
if
thou
best
not
an
ass
I
am
a
youth
of
fourteen
I
have
known
thee
already
To
I
dare
not
say
I
take
you
but
I
give
Me
and
my
service
ever
whilst
I
live
Into
your
guiding
power
This
is
the
man
Why
then
young
Bertram
take
her
shes
thy
wife
My
wife
my
liege
I
shall
beseech
your
Highness
In
such
a
business
give
me
leave
to
use
The
help
of
mine
own
eyes
Knowst
thou
not
Bertram
What
she
has
done
for
me
Yes
my
good
lord
But
never
hope
to
know
why
I
should
marry
her
Thou
knowst
she
has
raisd
me
from
my
sickly
bed
But
follows
it
my
lord
to
bring
me
down
Must
answer
for
your
raising
I
know
her
well
She
had
her
breeding
at
my
fathers
charge
poor
physicians
daughter
my
wife
Disdain
Rather
corrupt
me
ever
Tis
only
title
thou
disdainst
in
her
the
which
I
can
build
up
Strange
is
it
that
our
bloods
Of
colour
weight
and
heat
pourd
all
together
Would
quite
confound
distinction
yet
stand
off
In
differences
so
mighty
If
she
be
All
that
is
virtuoussave
what
thou
dislikst
poor
physicians
daughterthou
dislikst
Of
virtue
for
the
name
but
do
not
so
From
lowest
place
when
virtuous
things
proceed
The
place
is
dignified
by
the
doers
deed
Where
great
additions
swells
and
virtue
none
It
is
a
dropsied
honour
Good
alone
Is
good
without
a
name
Vileness
is
so
The
property
by
what
it
is
should
go
Not
by
the
title
She
is
young
wise
fair
In
these
to
nature
shes
immediate
heir
And
these
breed
honour
That
is
honours
scorn
Which
challenges
itself
as
honours
born
And
is
not
like
the
sire
Honours
thrive
When
rather
from
our
acts
we
them
derive
Than
our
foregoers
The
mere
words
a
slave
Debauchd
on
every
tomb
on
every
grave
lying
trophy
and
as
oft
is
dumb
Where
dust
and
damnd
oblivion
is
the
tomb
Of
honourd
bones
indeed
What
should
be
said
If
thou
canst
like
this
creature
as
a
maid
I
can
create
the
rest
Virtue
and
she
Is
her
own
dower
honour
and
wealth
from
me
I
cannot
love
her
nor
will
strive
to
do
t
Thou
wrongst
thyself
if
thou
shouldst
strive
to
choose
That
you
are
well
restord
my
lord
Im
glad
Let
the
rest
go
My
honours
at
the
stake
which
to
defeat
I
must
produce
my
power
Here
take
her
hand
Proud
scornful
boy
unworthy
this
good
gift
That
dost
in
vile
misprision
shackle
up
My
love
and
her
desert
that
canst
not
dream
We
poising
us
in
her
defective
scale
Shall
weigh
thee
to
the
beam
that
wilt
not
know
It
is
in
us
to
plant
thine
honour
where
We
please
to
have
it
grow
Check
thy
contempt
Obey
our
will
which
travails
in
thy
good
Believe
not
thy
disdain
but
presently
Do
thine
own
fortunes
that
obedient
right
Which
both
thy
duty
owes
and
our
power
claims
Or
I
will
throw
thee
from
my
care
for
ever
Into
the
staggers
and
the
careless
lapse
Of
youth
and
ignorance
both
my
revenge
and
hate
Loosing
upon
thee
in
the
name
of
justice
Without
all
terms
of
pity
Speak
thine
answer
Pardon
my
gracious
lord
for
I
submit
My
fancy
to
your
eyes
When
I
consider
What
great
creation
and
what
dole
of
honour
Flies
where
you
bid
it
I
find
that
she
which
late
Was
in
my
nobler
thoughts
most
base
is
now
The
praised
of
the
King
who
so
ennobled
Is
as
twere
born
so
Take
her
by
the
hand
And
tell
her
she
is
thine
to
whom
I
promise
counterpoise
if
not
to
thy
estate
balance
more
replete
I
take
her
hand
Good
fortune
and
the
favour
of
the
King
Smile
upon
this
contract
whose
ceremony
Shall
seem
expedient
on
the
nowborn
brief
And
be
performd
tonight
The
solemn
feast
Shall
more
attend
upon
the
coming
space
Expecting
absent
friends
As
thou
lovst
her
Thy
loves
to
me
religious
else
does
err
commenting
of
this
wedding
Do
you
hear
monsieur
word
with
you
Your
pleasure
sir
Your
lord
and
master
did
well
to
make
his
recantation
Recantation
My
Lord
my
master
Ay
is
it
not
a
language
I
speak
most
harsh
one
and
not
to
be
understood
without
bloody
succeeding
My
master
Are
you
companion
to
the
Count
Rousillon
To
any
count
to
all
counts
to
what

To

too
old
sir
let
it
satisfy
you
you
are
too
old
I
must
tell
thee
sirrah
I
write
man
to
which
title
age
cannot
bring
thee
What
I
dare
too
well
do
I
dare
not
do
I
did
think
thee
for
two
ordinaries
to
be
a
pretty
wise
fellow
thou
didst
make
tolerable
vent
of
thy
travel
it
might
pass
Yet
the
scarfs
and
the
bannerets
about
thee
did
manifoldly
dissuade
me
from
believing
thee
a
vessel
of
too
great
a
burden
I
have
now
found
thee
when
I
lose
thee
again
I
care
not
yet
art
thou
good
for
nothing
but
taking
up
and
that
thourt
scarce
worth
Hadst
thou
not
the
privilege
of
antiquity
upon
thee
Do
not
plunge
thyself
too
far
in
anger
lest
thou
hasten
thy
trial
which
ifLord
have
mercy
on
thee
for
a
hen
So
my
good
window
of
lattice
fare
thee
well
thy
casement
I
need
not
open
for
I
look
through
thee
Give
me
thy
hand
My
lord
you
give
me
most
egregious
indignity
Ay
with
all
my
heart
and
thou
art
worthy
of
it
I
have
not
my
lord
deservd
it
Yes
good
faith
evry
dram
of
it
and
I
will
not
bate
thee
a
scruple
Well
I
shall
be
wiser
Evn
as
soon
as
thou
canst
for
thou
hast
to
pull
at
a
smack
o
th
contrary
If
ever
thou
best
bound
in
thy
scarf
and
beaten
thou
shalt
find
what
it
is
to
be
proud
of
thy
bondage
I
have
a
desire
to
hold
my
acquaintance
with
thee
or
rather
my
knowledge
that
I
may
say
in
the
default
He
is
a
man
I
know
My
lord
you
do
me
most
insupportable
vexation
I
would
it
were
hell
pains
for
thy
sake
and
my
poor
doing
eternal
for
doing
I
am
past
as
I
will
by
thee
in
what
motion
age
will
give
me
leave
Well
thou
hast
a
son
shall
take
this
disgrace
off
me
scurvy
old
filthy
scurvy
lord
Well
I
must
be
patient
there
is
no
fettering
of
authority
Ill
beat
him
by
my
life
if
I
can
meet
him
with
any
convenience
an
he
were
double
and
double
a
lord
Ill
have
no
more
pity
of
his
age
than
I
would
have
of
Ill
beat
him
and
if
I
could
but
meet
him
again
Reenter
Sirrah
your
lord
and
masters
married
theres
news
for
you
you
have
a
new
mistress
I
most
unfeignedly
beseech
your
lordship
to
make
some
reservation
of
your
wrongs
He
is
my
good
lord
whom
I
serve
above
is
my
master
Who
God
Ay
sir
The
devil
it
is
thats
thy
master
Why
dost
thou
garter
up
thy
arms
o
this
fashion
Dost
make
hose
of
thy
sleeves
Do
other
servants
so
Thou
wert
best
set
thy
lower
part
where
thy
nose
stands
By
mine
honour
if
I
were
but
two
hours
younger
Id
beat
thee
Methinkst
thou
art
a
general
offence
and
every
man
should
beat
thee
I
think
thou
wast
created
for
men
to
breathe
themselves
upon
thee
This
is
hard
and
undeserved
measure
my
lord
Go
to
sir
you
were
beaten
in
Italy
for
picking
a
kernel
out
of
a
pomegranate
you
are
a
vagabond
and
no
true
traveller
you
are
more
saucy
with
lords
and
honourable
personages
than
the
commission
of
your
birth
and
virtue
gives
you
heraldry
You
are
not
worth
another
word
else
Id
call
you
knave
I
leave
you
Enter
Good
very
good
it
is
so
then
Good
very
good

Undone

forfeited
to
cares

ever
Whats
the
matter
sweetheart
Although
before
the
solemn
priest
I
have
sworn
I
will
not
bed
her
What
what
sweetheart
my
Parolles
they
have
married
me
Ill
to
the
Tuscan
wars
and
never
bed
her
France
is
a
doghole
and
it
no
more
merits
The
tread
of
a
mans
foot
To
th
wars
Theres
letters
from
my
mother
what
th
import
is
I
know
not
yet
Ay
that
would
be
known
To
th
wars
my
boy
to
th
wars
He
wears
his
honour
in
a
box
unseen
That
hugs
his
kickywicky
here
at
home
Spending
his
manly
marrow
in
her
arms
Which
should
sustain
the
bound
and
high
curvet
Of
Marss
fiery
steed
To
other
regions
France
is
a
stable
we
that
dwell
int
jades
Therefore
to
th
war
It
shall
be
so
Ill
send
her
to
my
house
Acquaint
my
mother
with
my
hate
to
her
And
wherefore
I
am
fled
write
to
the
King
That
which
I
durst
not
speak
His
present
gift
Shall
furnish
me
to
those
Italian
fields
Where
noble
fellows
strike
War
is
no
strife
To
the
dark
house
and
the
detested
wife
Will
this
capriccio
hold
in
thee
art
sure
Go
with
me
to
my
chamber
and
advise
me
Ill
send
her
straight
away
Tomorrow
Ill
to
the
wars
she
to
her
single
sorrow
Why
these
balls
bound
theres
noise
in
it
Tis
hard
young
man
married
is
a
man
thats
marrd
Therefore
away
and
leave
her
bravely
go
The
King
has
done
you
wrong
but
hush
tis
so
Paris
The
palace
Enter
and
My
mother
greets
me
kindly
is
she
well
She
is
not
well
but
yet
she
has
her
health
shes
very
merry
but
yet
she
is
not
well
But
thanks
be
given
shes
very
well
and
wants
nothing
i
th
world
but
yet
she
is
not
well
If
she
be
very
well
what
does
she
ail
that
shes
not
very
well
Truly
shes
very
well
indeed
but
for
two
things
What
two
things
One
that
shes
not
in
heaven
whither
God
send
her
quickly
The
other
that
shes
in
earth
from
whence
God
send
her
quickly
Enter
Bless
you
my
fortunate
lady
I
hope
sir
I
have
your
good
will
to
have
mine
own
good
fortunes
You
had
my
prayers
to
lead
them
on
and
to
keep
them
on
have
them
still
my
knave
how
does
my
old
lady
So
that
you
had
her
wrinkles
and
I
her
money
I
would
she
did
as
you
say
Why
I
say
nothing
Marry
you
are
the
wiser
man
for
many
a
mans
tongue
shakes
out
his
masters
undoing
To
say
nothing
to
do
nothing
to
know
nothing
and
to
have
nothing
is
to
be
a
great
part
of
your
title
which
is
within
a
very
little
of
nothing
Away
thart
a
knave
You
should
have
said
sir
Before
a
knave
thart
a
knave
thats
Before
me
thart
a
knave
This
had
been
truth
sir
Go
to
thou
art
a
witty
fool
I
have
found
thee
Did
you
find
me
in
yourself
sir
or
were
you
taught
to
find
me
The
search
sir
was
profitable
and
much
fool
may
you
find
in
you
even
to
the
worlds
pleasure
and
the
increase
of
laughter
good
knave
i
faith
and
well
fed
Madam
my
lord
will
go
away
tonight
very
serious
business
calls
on
him
The
great
prerogative
and
rite
of
love
Which
as
your
due
time
claims
he
does
acknowledge
But
puts
it
off
to
a
compelld
restraint
Whose
want
and
whose
delay
is
strewd
with
sweets
Which
they
distil
now
in
the
curbed
time
To
make
the
coming
hour
oerflow
with
joy
And
pleasure
drown
the
brim
Whats
his
else
That
you
will
take
your
instant
leave
o
th
King
And
make
this
haste
as
your
own
good
proceeding
Strengthned
with
what
apology
you
think
May
make
it
probable
need
What
more
commands
he
That
having
this
obtaind
you
presently
Attend
his
further
pleasure
In
everything
I
wait
upon
his
will
I
shall
report
it
so
I
pray
you
Come
sirrah
Paris
The
palace
Enter
and
But
I
hope
your
lordship
thinks
not
him
a
soldier
Yes
my
lord
and
of
very
valiant
approof
You
have
it
from
his
own
deliverance
And
by
other
warranted
testimony
Then
my
dial
goes
not
true
I
took
this
lark
for
a
bunting
I
do
assure
you
my
lord
he
is
very
great
in
knowledge
and
accordingly
valiant
I
have
then
sinnd
against
his
experience
and
transgressd
against
his
valour
and
my
state
that
way
is
dangerous
since
I
cannot
yet
find
in
my
heart
to
repent
Here
he
comes
I
pray
you
make
us
friends
I
will
pursue
the
amity
Enter
To
These
things
shall
be
done
sir
Pray
you
sir
whos
his
tailor
Sir
I
know
him
well
Ay
sir
he
sir
s
a
good
workman
a
very
good
tailor
Aside
to
Is
she
gone
to
the
King
She
is
Will
she
away
tonight
As
youll
have
her
I
have
writ
my
letters
casketed
my
treasure
Given
order
for
our
horses
and
tonight
When
I
should
take
possession
of
the
bride
End
ere
I
do
begin
good
traveller
is
something
at
the
latter
end
of
a
dinner
but
one
that
lies
threethirds
and
uses
a
known
truth
to
pass
a
thousand
nothings
with
should
be
once
heard
and
thrice
beaten
God
save
you
Captain
Is
there
any
unkindness
between
my
lord
and
you
monsieur
I
know
not
how
I
have
deserved
to
run
into
my
lords
displeasure
You
have
made
shift
to
run
into
t
boots
and
spurs
and
all
like
him
that
leapt
into
the
custard
and
out
of
it
youll
run
again
rather
than
suffer
question
for
your
residence
It
may
be
you
have
mistaken
him
my
lord
And
shall
do
so
ever
though
I
took
him
ats
prayers
Fare
you
well
my
lord
and
believe
this
of
me
there
can
be
no
kernal
in
this
light
nut
the
soul
of
this
man
is
his
clothes
trust
him
not
in
matter
of
heavy
consequence
I
have
kept
of
them
tame
and
know
their
natures
Farewell
monsieur
I
have
spoken
better
of
you
than
you
have
or
will
to
deserve
at
my
hand
but
we
must
do
good
against
evil
An
idle
lord
I
swear
I
think
so
Why
do
you
not
know
him
Yes
I
do
know
him
well
and
common
speech
Gives
him
a
worthy
pass
Here
comes
my
clog
Enter
I
have
sir
as
I
was
commanded
from
you
Spoke
with
the
King
and
have
procurd
his
leave
For
present
parting
only
he
desires
Some
private
speech
with
you
I
shall
obey
his
will
You
must
not
marvel
Helen
at
my
course
Which
holds
not
colour
with
the
time
nor
does
The
ministration
and
required
office
On
my
particular
Prepard
I
was
not
For
such
a
business
therefore
am
I
found
So
much
unsettled
This
drives
me
to
entreat
you
That
presently
you
take
your
way
for
home
And
rather
muse
than
ask
why
I
entreat
you
For
my
respects
are
better
than
they
seem
And
my
appointments
have
in
them
a
need
Greater
than
shows
itself
at
the
first
view
To
you
that
know
them
not
This
to
my
mother
Giving
a
letter
Twill
be
two
days
ere
I
shall
see
you
so
I
leave
you
to
your
wisdom
Sir
I
can
nothing
say
But
that
I
am
your
most
obedient
servant
Come
come
no
more
of
that
And
ever
shall
With
true
observance
seek
to
eke
out
that
Wherein
toward
me
my
homely
stars
have
faild
To
equal
my
great
fortune
Let
that
go
My
haste
is
very
great
Farewell
hie
home
Pray
sir
your
pardon
Well
what
would
you
say
I
am
not
worthy
of
the
wealth
I
owe
Nor
dare
I
say
tis
mine
and
yet
it
is
But
like
a
timorous
thief
most
fain
would
steal
What
law
does
vouch
mine
own
What
would
you
have
Something
and
scarce
so
much
nothing
indeed
I
would
not
tell
you
what
I
would
my
lord
Faith
yes
Strangers
and
foes
do
sunder
and
not
kiss
I
pray
you
stay
not
but
in
haste
to
horse
I
shall
not
break
your
bidding
good
my
lord
Where
are
my
other
men
monsieur
Farewell
Go
thou
toward
home
where
I
will
never
come
Whilst
I
can
shake
my
sword
or
hear
the
drum
Away
and
for
our
flight
Bravely
coragio
Florence
The

palace
Flourish
Enter
the
attended
two
with
a
So
that
from
point
to
point
now
have
you
hear
The
fundamental
reasons
of
this
war
Whose
great
decision
hath
much
blood
let
forth
And
more
thirsts
after
Holy
seems
the
quarrel
Upon
your
Graces
part
black
and
fearful
On
the
opposer
Therefore
we
marvel
much
our
cousin
France
Would
in
so
just
a
business
shut
his
bosom
Against
our
borrowing
prayers
Good
my
lord
The
reasons
of
our
state
I
cannot
yield
But
like
a
common
and
an
outward
man
That
the
great
figure
of
a
council
frames
By
selfunable
motion
therefore
dare
not
Say
what
I
think
of
it
since
I
have
found
Myself
in
my
incertain
grounds
to
fail
As
often
as
I
guessd
Be
it
his
pleasure
But
I
am
sure
the
younger
of
our
nature
That
surfeit
on
their
ease
will
day
by
day
Come
here
for
physic
Welcome
shall
they
be
And
all
the
honours
that
can
fly
from
us
Shall
on
them
settle
You
know
your
places
well
When
better
fall
for
your
avails
they
fell
Tomorrow
to
th
field
Flourish
Rousillon
The
palace
Enter
and
It
hath
happend
all
as
I
would
have
had
it
save
that
he
comes
not
along
with
her
By
my
troth
I
take
my
young
lord
to
be
a
very
melancholy
man
By
what
observance
I
pray
you
Why
he
will
look
upon
his
boot
and
sing
mend
the
ruff
and
sing
ask
questions
and
sing
pick
his
teeth
and
sing
I
know
a
man
that
had
this
trick
of
melancholy
sold
a
goodly
manor
for
a
song
Let
me
see
what
he
writes
and
when
he
means
to
come
Opening
a
letter
I
have
no
mind
to
Isbel
since
I
was
at
court
Our
old
ling
and
our
Isbels
o
th
country
are
nothing
like
your
old
ling
and
your
Isbels
o
th
court
The
brains
of
my
Cupids
knockd
out
and
I
begin
to
love
as
an
old
man
loves
money
with
no
stomach
What
have

here
Een
that
you
have
there
Reads
I
have
sent

You

hear
I

If
there

I
will
hold
a
long
distance
My
duty
to
you
Your
unfortunate
son
This
is
not
well
rash
and
unbridled
boy
To
fly
the
favours
of
so
good
a
king
To
pluck
his
indignation
on
thy
head
By
the
misprizing
of
a
maid
too
virtuous
For
the
contempt
of
empire
Reenter
madam
yonder

heavy
news
within
between
two
soldiers
and
my
young
lady
What
is
the
matter
Nay
there
is
some
comfort
in
the
news
some
comfort
your
son
will
not
be
killd
so
soon
as
I
thought
he
would
Why
should
he
be
killd
So
say
I
madam
if
he
run
away
as
I
hear
he
does
the
danger
is
in
standing
to
t
thats
the
loss
of
men
though
it
be
the
getting
of
children
Here
they
come
will
tell
you
more
For
my
part
I
only
hear
your
son
was
run
away
Enter

the
two
Save

quirks
of

is
a
dreadful
sentence
Brought
you
this
letter
gentlemen
Ay
madam
And
for
the
contents
sake
are
sorry
for
our
pains
I
prithee
lady
have
a
better
cheer
If
thou
engrossest
all
the
griefs
are
thine
Thou
robbst
me
of
a
moiety
He
was
my
son
But
I
do
wash
his
name
out
of
my
blood
And
thou
art
all
my
child
Towards
Florence
is
he
Ay
madam
And
to
be
a
soldier
Such
is
his
noble
purpose
and
believe
t
The
Duke
will
lay
upon
him
all
the
honour
That
good
convenience
claims
Return
you
thither
Ay
madam
with
the
swiftest
wing
of
speed
Reads
Till
I
have
no
wife
I
have
nothing
in
France
Tis
bitter
Find
you
that
there
Ay
madam
Tis
but
the
boldness
of
his
hand
haply
which
his
heart
was
not
consenting
to
Nothing
in
France
until
he
have
no
wife
Theres
nothing
here
that
is
too
good
for
him
But
only
she
and
she
deserves
a
lord
That
twenty
such
rude
boys
might
tend
upon
And
call
her
hourly
mistress
Who
was
with
him
servant
only
and
a
gentleman
Which
I
have
sometime
known
Parolles
was
it
not
Ay
my
good
lady
he
very
tainted
fellow
and
full
of
wickedness
My
son
corrupts
a
wellderived
nature
With
his
inducement
Indeed
good
lady
The
fellow
has
a
deal
of
that
too
much
Which
holds
him
much
to
have
Yare
welcome
gentlemen
I
will
entreat
you
when
you
see
my
son
To
tell
him
that
his
sword
can
never
win
The
honour
that
he
loses
More
Ill
entreat
you
Written
to
bear
along
We
serve
you
madam
In
that
and
all
your
worthiest
affairs
Not
so
but
as
we
change
our
courtesies
Will
you
draw
near
Till
I
have
no
wife
I
have
nothing
in
France
Nothing
in
France
until
he
has
no
wife
Thou
shalt
have
none
Rousillon
none
in
France
Then
hast
thou
all
again
Poor
lord
ist
That
chase
thee
from
thy
country
and
expose
Those
tender
limbs
of
thine
to
the
event
Of
the
nonsparing
war
And
is
it
I
That
drive
thee
from
the
sportive
court
where
thou
Wast
shot
at
with
fair
eyes
to
be
the
mark
Of
smoky
muskets
you
leaden
messengers
That
ride
upon
the
violent
speed
of
fire
Fly
with
false
aim
move
the
stillpiecing
air
That
sings
with
piercing
do
not
touch
my
lord
Whoever
shoots
at
him
I
set
him
there
Whoever
charges
on
his
forward
breast
I
am
the
caitiff
that
do
hold
him
tot
And
though
I
kill
him
not
I
am
the
cause
His
death
was
so
effected
Better
twere
I
met
the
ravin
lion
when
he
roard
With
sharp
constraint
of
hunger
better
twere
That
all
the
miseries
which
nature
owes
Were
mine
at
once
No
come
thou
home
Rousillon
Whence
honour
but
of
danger
wins
a
scar
As
oft
it
loses
all
I
will
be
gone
My
being
here
it
is
that
holds
thee
hence
Shall
I
stay
here
to
do
t
No
no
although
The
air
of
paradise
did
fan
the
house
And
angels
officd
all
I
will
be
gone
That
pitiful
rumour
may
report
my
flight
To
consolate
thine
ear
Come
night
end
day
For
with
the
dark
poor
thief
Ill
steal
away
Florence
Before
the
DUKEs
palace
Flourish
Enter
the
drum
and
trumpets
The
General
of
our
Horse
thou
art
and
we
Great
in
our
hope
lay
our
best
love
and
credence
Upon
thy
promising
fortune
Sir
it
is
charge
too
heavy
for
my
strength
but
yet
Well
strive
to
bear
it
for
your
worthy
sake
To
th
extreme
edge
of
hazard
Then
go
thou
forth
And
Fortune
play
upon
thy
prosperous
helm
As
thy
auspicious
mistress
This
very
day
Great
Mars
I
put
myself
into
thy
file
Make
me
but
like
my
thoughts
and
I
shall
prove
lover
of
thy
drum
hater
of
love
Rousillon
The
palace
Enter
and
Alas
and
would
you
take
the
letter
of
her
Might
you
not
know
she
would
do
as
she
has
done
By
sending
me
a
letter
Read
it
again
Reads
I
am
Saint
Jaques
pilgrim
thither
gone
Ambitious
love
hath
so
in
me
offended
That
barefoot
plod
I
the
cold
ground
upon
With
sainted
vow
my
faults
to
have
amended
Write
write
that
from
the
bloody
course
of
war
My
dearest
master
your
dear
son
may
hie
Bless
him
at
home
in
peace
whilst
I
from
far
His
name
with
zealous
fervour
sanctify
His
taken
labours
bid
him
me
forgive
I
his
despiteful
Juno
sent
him
forth
From
courtly
friends
with
camping
foes
to
live
Where
death
and
danger
dogs
the
heels
of
worth
He
is
too
good
and
fair
for
death
and
me
Whom
I
myself
embrace
to
set
him
free
Ah
what
sharp
stings
are
in
her
mildest
words
Rinaldo
you
did
never
lack
advice
so
much
As
letting
her
pass
so
had
I
spoke
with
her
I
could
have
well
diverted
her
intents
Which
thus
she
hath
prevented
Pardon
me
madam
If
I
had
given
you
this
at
overnight
She
might
have
been
oer
taen
and
yet
she
writes
Pursuit
would
be
but
vain
What
angel
shall
Bless
this
unworthy
husband
He
cannot
thrive
Unless
her
prayers
whom
heaven
delights
to
hear
And
loves
to
grant
reprieve
him
from
the
wrath
Of
greatest
justice
Write
write
Rinaldo
To
this
unworthy
husband
of
his
wife
Let
every
word
weigh
heavy
of
her
worth
That
he
does
weigh
too
light
My
greatest
grief
Though
little
he
do
feel
it
set
down
sharply
Dispatch
the
most
convenient
messenger
When
haply
he
shall
hear
that
she
is
gone
He
will
return
and
hope
I
may
that
she
Hearing
so
much
will
speed
her
foot
again
Led
hither
by
pure
love
Which
of
them
both
Is
dearest
to
me
I
have
no
skill
in
sense
To
make
distinction
Provide
this
messenger
My
heart
is
heavy
and
mine
age
is
weak
Grief
would
have
tears
and
sorrow
bids
me
speak
Without
the
walls
of
Florence
tucket
afar
off
Enter
an
old
her
daughter
and
with
other
Nay
come
for
if
they
do
approach
the
city
we
shall
lose
all
the
sight
They
say
the
French
count
has
done
most
honourable
service
It
is
reported
that
he
has
taken
their
greatst
commander
and
that
with
his
own
hand
he
slew
the
Dukes
brother
Tucket
We
have
lost
our
labour
they
are
gone
a
contrary
way
Hark
you
may
know
by
their
trumpets
Come
lets
return
again
and
suffice
ourselves
with
the
report
of
it
Well
Diana
take
heed
of
this
French
earl
the
honour
of
a
maid
is
her
name
and
no
legacy
is
so
rich
as
honesty
I
have
told
my
neighbour
how
you
have
been
solicited
by
a
gentleman
his
companion
I
know
that
knave
hang
him
one
Parolles
a
filthy
officer
he
is
in
those
suggestions
for
the
young
earl
Beware
of
them
Diana
their
promises
enticements
oaths
tokens
and
all
these
engines
of
lust
are
not
the
things
they
go
under
many
a
maid
hath
been
seduced
by
them
and
the
misery
is
example
that
so
terrible
shows
in
the
wreck
of
maidenhood
cannot
for
all
that
dissuade
succession
but
that
they
are
limed
with
the
twigs
that
threatens
them
I
hope
I
need
not
to
advise
you
further
but
I
hope
your
own
grace
will
keep
you
where
you
are
though
there
were
no
further
danger
known
but
the
modesty
which
is
so
lost
You
shall
not
need
to
fear
me
Enter
in
the
dress
of
a
pilgrim
I
hope
so
Look
here
comes
a
pilgrim
I
know
she
will
lie
at
my
house
thither
they
send
one
another
Ill
question
her
God
save
you
pilgrim
Whither
are
bound
To
Saint
Jaques
le
Grand
Where
do
the
palmers
lodge
I
do
beseech
you
At
the
Saint
Francis
here
beside
the
port
Is
this
the
way
march
afar
Ay
marry
ist
Hark
you
They
come
this
way
If
you
will
tarry
holy
pilgrim
But
till
the
troops
come
by
I
will
conduct
you
where
you
shall
be
lodgd
The
rather
for
I
think
I
know
your
hostess
As
ample
as
myself
Is
it
yourself
If
you
shall
please
so
pilgrim
I
thank
you
and
will
stay
upon
your
leisure
You
came
I
think
from
France
I
did
so
Here
you
shall
see
a
countryman
of
yours
That
has
done
worthy
service
His
name
I
pray
you
The
Count
Rousillon
Know
you
such
a
one
But
by
the
ear
that
hears
most
nobly
of
him
His
face
I
know
not
What
someer
he
is
Hes
bravely
taken
here
He
stole
from
France
As
tis
reported
for
the
King
had
married
him
Against
his
liking
Think
you
it
is
so
Ay
surely
mere
the
truth
I
know
his
lady
There
is
a
gentleman
that
serves
the
Count
Reports
but
coarsely
of
her
Whats
his
name
Monsieur
Parolles
I
believe
with
him
In
argument
of
praise
or
to
the
worth
Of
the
great
Count
himself
she
is
too
mean
To
have
her
name
repeated
all
her
deserving
Is
a
reserved
honesty
and
that
I
have
not
heard
examind
Alas
poor
lady
Tis
a
hard
bondage
to
become
the
wife
Of
a
detesting
lord
I
sweet
good
creature
wheresoeer
she
is
Her
heart
weighs
sadly
This
young
maid
might
do
her
shrewd
turn
if
she
pleasd
How
do
you
mean
May
be
the
amorous
Count
solicits
her
In
the
unlawful
purpose
He
does
indeed
And
brokes
with
all
that
can
in
such
a
suit
Corrupt
the
tender
honour
of
a
maid
But
she
is
armd
for
him
and
keeps
her
guard
In
honestest
defence
Enter
with
drum
and
colours
and
the
whole
The
gods
forbid
else
So
now
they
come
That
is
Antonio
the
Dukes
eldest
son
That
Escalus
Which
is
the
Frenchman
He
That
with
the
plume
tis
a
most
gallant
fellow
I
would
he
lovd
his
wife
if
he
were
honester
He
were
much
goodlier
Ist
not
a
handsome
gentleman
I
like
him
well
Tis
pity
he
is
not
honest
Yonds
that
same
knave
That
leads
him
to
these
places
were
I
his
lady
I
would
poison
that
vile
rascal
Which
is
he
That
jackanapes
with
scarfs
Why
is
he
melancholy
Perchance
hes
hurt
i
th
battle
Lose
our
drum
well
Hes
shrewdly
vexd
at
something
Look
he
has
spied
us
Marry
hang
you
And
your
courtesy
for
a
ringcarrier
The
troop
is
past
Come
pilgrim
I
will
bring
you
Where
you
shall
host
Of
enjoind
penitents
Theres
four
or
five
to
great
Saint
Jaques
bound
Already
at
my
house
I
humbly
thank
you
Please
it
this
matron
and
this
gentle
maid
To
eat
with
us
tonight
the
charge
and
thanking
Shall
be
for
me
and
to
requite
you
further
I
will
bestow
some
precepts
of
this
virgin
Worthy
the
note
Well
take
your
offer
kindly
Camp
before
Florence
Enter
and
the
two
Nay
good
my
lord
put
him
tot
let
him
have
his
way
If
your
lordship
find
him
not
a
hiding
hold
me
no
more
in
your
respect
On
my
life
my
lord
a
bubble
Do
you
think
I
am
so
far
deceived
in
him
Believe
it
my
lord
in
mine
own
direct
knowledge
without
any
malice
but
to
speak
of
him
as
my
kinsman
hes
a
most
notable
coward
an
infinite
and
endless
liar
an
hourly
promisebreaker
the
owner
of
no
one
good
quality
worthy
your
lordships
entertainment
It
were
fit
you
knew
him
lest
reposing
too
far
in
his
virtue
which
he
hath
not
he
might
at
some
great
and
trusty
business
in
a
main
danger
fail
you
I
would
I
knew
in
what
particular
action
to
try
him
None
better
than
to
let
him
fetch
off
his
drum
which
you
hear
him
so
confidently
undertake
to
do
I
with
a
troop
of
Florentines
will
suddenly
surprise
him
such
I
will
have
whom
I
am
sure
he
knows
not
from
the
enemy
We
will
bind
and
hoodwink
him
so
that
he
shall
suppose
no
other
but
that
he
is
carried
into
the
leaguer
of
the
adversaries
when
we
bring
him
to
our
own
tents
Be
but
your
lordship
present
at
his
examination
if
he
do
not
for
the
promise
of
his
life
and
in
the
highest
compulsion
of
base
fear
offer
to
betray
you
and
deliver
all
the
intelligence
in
his
power
against
you
and
that
with
the
divine
forfeit
of
his
soul
upon
oath
never
trust
my
judgment
in
anything
for
the
love
of
laughter
let
him
fetch
his
drum
he
says
he
has
a
stratagem
fort
When
your
lordship
sees
the
bottom
of
his
success
int
and
to
what
metal
this
counterfeit
lump
of
ore
will
be
melted
if
you
give
him
not
John
Drums
entertainment
your
inclining
cannot
be
removed
Here
he
comes
Enter
for
the
love
of
laughter
hinder
not
the
honour
of
his
design
let
him
fetch
off
his
drum
in
any
hand
How
now
monsieur
This
drum
sticks
sorely
in
your
disposition
pox
on
t
let
it
go
tis
but
a
drum
But
a
drum
Ist
but
a
drum
drum
so
lost
There
was
excellent
command
to
charge
in
with
our
horse
upon
our
own
wings
and
to
rend
our
own
soldiers
That
was
not
to
be
blamd
in
the
command
of
the
service
it
was
a
disaster
of
war
that
Caesar
himself
could
not
have
prevented
if
he
had
been
there
to
command
Well
we
cannot
greatly
condemn
our
success
Some
dishonour
we
had
in
the
loss
of
that
drum
but
it
is
not
to
be
recovered
It
might
have
been
recovered
It
might
but
it
is
not
now
It
is
to
be
recovered
But
that
the
merit
of
service
is
seldom
attributed
to
the
true
and
exact
performer
I
would
have
that
drum
or
another
or
hic
jacet
Why
if
you
have
a
stomach
tot
monsieur
If
you
think
your
mystery
in
stratagem
can
bring
this
instrument
of
honour
again
into
his
native
quarter
be
magnanimous
in
the
enterprise
and
go
on
I
will
grace
the
attempt
for
a
worthy
exploit
If
you
speed
well
in
it
the
Duke
shall
both
speak
of
it
and
extend
to
you
what
further
becomes
his
greatness
even
to
the
utmost
syllable
of
our
worthiness
By
the
hand
of
a
soldier
I
will
undertake
it
But
you
must
not
now
slumber
in
it
Ill
about
it
this
evening
and
I
will
presently
pen
down
my
dilemmas
encourage
myself
in
my
certainty
put
myself
into
my
mortal
preparation
and
by
midnight
look
to
hear
further
from
me
May
I
be
bold
to
acquaint
his
Grace
you
are
gone
about
it
I
know
not
what
the
success
will
be
my
lord
but
the
attempt
I
vow
I
know
th
art
valiant
and
to
the
of
thy
soldiership
will
subscribe
for
thee
Farewell
I
love
not
many
words
No
more
than
a
fish
loves
water
Is
not
this
a
strange
fellow
my
lord
that
so
confidently
seems
to
undertake
this
business
which
he
knows
is
not
to
be
done
damns
himself
to
do
and
dares
better
be
damnd
than
to
do
t
You
do
not
know
him
my
lord
as
we
do
Certain
it
is
that
he
will
steal
himself
into
a
mans
favour
and
for
a
week
escape
a
great
deal
of
discoveries
but
when
you
find
him
out
you
have
him
ever
after
Why
do
you
think
he
will
make
no
deed
at
all
of
this
that
so
seriously
he
does
address
himself
unto
None
in
the
world
but
return
with
an
invention
and
clap
upon
you
two
or
three
probable
lies
But
we
have
almost
embossd
him
You
shall
see
his
fall
tonight
for
indeed
he
is
not
for
your
lordships
respect
Well
make
you
some
sport
with
the
fox
ere
we
case
him
He
was
first
smokd
by
the
old
Lord
Lafeu
When
his
disguise
and
he
is
parted
tell
me
what
a
sprat
you
shall
find
him
which
you
shall
see
this
very
night
I
must
go
look
my
twigs
he
shall
be
caught
Your
brother
he
shall
go
along
with
me
Ast
please
your
lordship
Ill
leave
you
Now
will
I
lead
you
to
the
house
and
show
you
The
lass
I
spoke
of
But
you
say
shes
honest
Thats
all
the
fault
I
spoke
with
her
but
once
And
found
her
wondrous
cold
but
I
sent
to
her
By
this
same
coxcomb
that
we
have
i
th
wind
Tokens
and
letters
which
she
did
resend
And
this
is
all
I
have
done
Shes
a
fair
creature
Will
you
go
see
her
With
all
my
heart
my
lord
Florence
The
house
Enter
and
If
you
misdoubt
me
that
I
am
not
she
I
know
not
how
I
shall
assure
you
further
But
I
shall
lose
the
grounds
I
work
upon
Though
my
estate
be
falln
I
was
well
born
Nothing
acquainted
with
these
businesses
And
would
not
put
my
reputation
now
In
any
staining
act
Nor
would
I
wish
you
give
me
trust
the
Count
he
is
my
husband
And
what
to
your
sworn
counsel
I
have
spoken
Is
so
from
word
to
word
and
then
you
cannot
By
the
good
aid
that
I
of
you
shall
borrow
Err
in
bestowing
it
I
should
believe
you
For
you
have
showd
me
that
which
well
approves
Yare
great
in
fortune
Take
this
purse
of
gold
And
let
me
buy
your
friendly
help
thus
far
Which
I
will
overpay
and
pay
again
When
I
have
found
it
The
Count
he
woos
your
daughter
Lays
down
his
wanton
siege
before
her
beauty
Resolvd
to
carry
her
Let
her
in
fine
consent
As
well
direct
her
how
tis
best
to
bear
it
Now
his
important
blood
will
nought
deny
That
shell
demand
ring
the
County
wears
That
downward
hath
succeeded
in
his
house
From
son
to
son
some
four
or
five
descents
Since
the
first
father
wore
it
This
ring
he
holds
In
most
rich
choice
yet
in
his
idle
fire
To
buy
his
will
it
would
not
seem
too
dear
Howeer
repented
after
Now
I
see
The
bottom
of
your
purpose
You
see
it
lawful
then
It
is
no
more
But
that
your
daughter
ere
she
seems
as
won
Desires
this
ring
appoints
him
an
encounter
In
fine
delivers
me
to
fill
the
time
Herself
most
chastely
absent
After
this
To
marry
her
Ill
add
three
thousand
crowns
To
what
is
passd
already
I
have
yielded
Instruct
my
daughter
how
she
shall
persever
That
time
and
place
with
this
deceit
so
lawful
May
prove
coherent
Every
night
he
comes
With
musics
of
all
sorts
and
songs
composd
To
her
unworthiness
It
nothing
steads
us
To
chide
him
from
our
eaves
for
he
persists
As
if
his
life
lay
on
t
Why
then
tonight
Let
us
assay
our
plot
which
if
it
speed
Is
wicked
meaning
in
a
lawful
deed
And
lawful
meaning
in
a
lawful
act
Where
both
not
sin
and
yet
a
sinful
fact
But
lets
about
it
Without
the
Florentine
camp
Enter
with
five
or
six
other
in
ambush
He
can
come
no
other
way
but
by
this
hedgecorner
When
you
sally
upon
him
speak
what
terrible
language
you
will
though
you
understand
it
not
yourselves
no
matter
for
we
must
not
seem
to
understand
him
unless
some
one
among
us
whom
we
must
produce
for
an
interpreter
Good
captain
let
me
be
th
interpreter
Art
not
acquainted
with
him
Knows
he
not
thy
voice
No
sir
I
warrant
you
But
what
linseywoolsey
has
thou
to
speak
to
us
again
Een
such
as
you
speak
to
me
He
must
think
us
some
band
of
strangers
i
th
adversarys
entertainment
Now
he
hath
a
smack
of
all
neighbouring
languages
therefore
we
must
every
one
be
a
man
of
his
own
fancy
not
to
know
what
we
speak
one
to
another
so
we
seem
to
know
is
to
know
straight
our
purpose
choughs
language
gabble
enough
and
good
enough
As
for
you
interpreter
you
must
seem
very
politic
But
couch
ho
here
he
comes
to
beguile
two
hours
in
a
sleep
and
then
to
return
and
swear
the
lies
he
forges
Enter
Ten
oclock
Within
these
three
hours
twill
be
time
enough
to
go
home
What
shall
I
say
I
have
done
It
must
be
a
very
plausive
invention
that
carries
it
They
begin
to
smoke
me
and
disgraces
have
of
late
knockd
to
often
at
my
door
I
find
my
tongue
is
too
foolhardy
but
my
heart
hath
the
fear
of
Mars
before
it
and
of
his
creatures
not
daring
the
reports
of
my
tongue
This
is
the
first
truth
that
eer
thine
own
tongue
was
guilty
of
What
the
devil
should
move
me
to
undertake
the
recovery
of
this
drum
being
not
ignorant
of
the
impossibility
and
knowing
I
had
no
such
purpose
I
must
give
myself
some
hurts
and
say
I
got
them
in
exploit
Yet
slight
ones
will
not
carry
it
They
will
say
Came
you
off
with
so
little
And
great
ones
I
dare
not
give
Wherefore
whats
the
instance
Tongue
I
must
put
you
into
a
butterwomans
mouth
and
buy
myself
another
of
Bajazets
mule
if
you
prattle
me
into
these
perils
Is
it
possible
he
should
know
what
he
is
and
be
that
he
is
I
would
the
cutting
of
my
garments
would
serve
the
turn
or
the
breaking
of
my
Spanish
sword
We
cannot
afford
you
so
Or
the
baring
of
my
beard
and
to
say
it
was
in
stratagem
Twould
not
do
Or
to
drown
my
clothes
and
say
I
was
strippd
Hardly

Though
I

I

How

Thirty

Florence
The
house
Enter
and
They
told
me
that
your
name
was
Fontibell
No
my
good
lord
Diana
Titled
goddess
And
worth
it
with
addition
But
fair
soul
In
your
fine
frame
hath
love
no
quality
If
the
quick
fire
of
youth
light
not
your
mind
You
are
no
maiden
but
a
monument
When
you
are
dead
you
should
be
such
a
one
As
you
are
now
for
you
are
cold
and
stern
And
now
you
should
be
as
your
mother
was
When
your
sweet
self
was
got
She
then
was
honest
So
should
you
be
No
My
mother
did
but
duty
such
my
lord
As
you
owe
to
your
wife
No
more
othat
I
prithee
do
not
strive
against
my
vows
I
was
compelld
to
her
but
I
love
the
By
loves
own
sweet
constraint
and
will
for
ever
Do
thee
all
rights
of
service
Ay
so
you
serve
us
Till
we
serve
you
but
when
you
have
our
roses
You
barely
leave
our
thorns
to
prick
ourselves
And
mock
us
with
our
bareness
How
have
I
sworn
Tis
not
the
many
oaths
that
makes
the
truth
But
the
plain
single
vow
that
is
vowd
true
What
is
not
holy
that
we
swear
not
by
But
take
the
Highst
to
witness
Then
pray
you
tell
me
If
I
should
swear
by
Joves
great
attributes
I
lovd
you
dearly
would
you
believe
my
oaths
When
I
did
love
you
ill
This
has
no
holding
To
swear
by
him
whom
I
protest
to
love
That
I
will
work
against
him
Therefore
your
oaths
Are
words
and
poor
conditions
but
unseald
At
least
in
my
opinion
Change
it
change
it
Be
not
so
holycruel
Love
is
holy
And
my
integrity
neer
knew
the
crafts
That
you
do
charge
men
with
Stand
no
more
off
But
give
thyself
unto
my
sick
desires
Who
then
recovers
Say
thou
art
mine
and
ever
My
love
as
it
begins
shall
so
persever
I
see
that
men
make
ropes
in
such
a
scarre
That
well
forsake
ourselves
Give
me
that
ring
Ill
lend
it
thee
my
dear
but
have
no
power
To
give
it
from
me
Will
you
not
my
lord
It
is
an
honour
longing
to
our
house
Bequeathed
down
from
many
ancestors
Which
were
the
greatest
obloquy
i
th
world
In
me
to
lose
Mine
honours
such
a
ring
My
chastitys
the
jewel
of
our
house
Bequeathed
down
from
many
ancestors
Which
were
the
greatest
obloquy
i
th
world
In
me
to
lose
Thus
your
own
proper
wisdom
Brings
in
the
champion
Honour
on
my
part
Against
your
vain
assault
Here
take
my
ring
My
house
mine
honour
yea
my
life
be
thine
And
Ill
be
bid
by
thee
When
midnight
comes
knock
at
my
chamber
window
Ill
order
take
my
mother
shall
not
hear
Now
will
I
charge
you
in
the
band
of
truth
When
you
have
conquerd
my
yet
maiden
bed
Remain
there
but
an
hour
nor
speak
to
me
My
reasons
are
most
strong
and
you
shall
know
them
When
back
again
this
ring
shall
be
deliverd
And
on
your
finger
in
the
night
Ill
put
Another
ring
that
what
in
time
proceeds
May
token
to
the
future
our
past
deeds
Adieu
till
then
then
fail
not
You
have
won
wife
of
me
though
there
my
hope
be
done
heaven
on
earth
I
have
won
by
wooing
thee
For
which
live
long
to
thank
both
heaven
and
me
You
may
so
in
the
end
My
mother
told
me
just
how
he
would
woo
As
if
she
sat
ins
heart
she
says
all
men
Have
the
like
oaths
He
had
sworn
to
marry
me
When
his
wifes
dead
therefore
Ill
lie
with
him
When
I
am
buried
Since
Frenchmen
are
so
braid
Marry
that
will
I
live
and
die
a
maid
Only
in
this
disguise
I
thinkt
no
sin
To
cozen
him
that
would
unjustly
win
The
Florentine
camp
Enter
the
two
and
two
or
three
You
have
not
given
him
his
mothers
letter
I
have
delivred
it
an
hour
since
There
is
something
int
that
stings
his
nature
for
on
the
reading
it
he
changd
almost
into
another
man
He
has
much
worthy
blame
laid
upon
him
for
shaking
off
so
good
a
wife
and
so
sweet
a
lady
Especially
he
hath
incurred
the
everlasting
displeasure
of
the
King
who
had
even
tund
his
bounty
to
sing
happiness
to
him
I
will
tell
you
a
thing
but
you
shall
let
it
dwell
darkly
with
you
When
you
have
spoken
it
tis
dead
and
I
am
the
grave
of
it
He
hath
perverted
a
young
gentlewoman
here
in
Florence
of
a
most
chaste
renown
and
this
night
he
fleshes
his
will
in
the
spoil
of
her
honour
He
hath
given
her
his
monumental
ring
and
thinks
himself
made
in
the
unchaste
composition
Now
God
delay
our
rebellion
As
we
are
ourselves
what
things
are
we
Merely
our
own
traitors
And
as
in
the
common
course
of
all
treasons
we
still
see
them
reveal
themselves
till
they
attain
to
their
abhorrd
ends
so
he
that
in
this
action
contrives
against
his
own
nobility
in
his
proper
stream
oerflows
himself
Is
it
not
meant
damnable
in
us
to
be
trumpeters
of
our
unlawful
intents
We
shall
not
then
have
his
company
tonight
Not
till
after
midnight
for
he
is
dieted
to
his
hour
That
approaches
apace
I
would
gladly
have
him
see
his
company
anatomizd
that
he
might
take
a
measure
of
his
own
judgments
wherein
so
curiously
he
had
set
this
counterfeit
We
will
not
meddle
with
him
till
he
come
for
his
presence
must
be
the
whip
of
the
other
In
the
meantime
what
hear
you
of
these
wars
I
hear
there
is
an
overture
of
peace
Nay
I
assure
you
a
peace
concluded
What
will
Count
Rousillon
do
then
Will
he
travel
higher
or
return
again
into
France
I
perceive
by
this
demand
you
are
not
altogether
of
his
counsel
Let
it
be
forbid
sir
So
should
I
be
a
great
deal
of
his
act
Sir
his
wife
some
two
months
since
fled
from
his
house
Her
pretence
is
a
pilgrimage
to
Saint
Jaques
le
Grand
which
holy
undertaking
with
most
austere
sanctimony
she
accomplishd
and
there
residing
the
tenderness
of
her
nature
became
as
a
prey
to
her
grief
in
fine
made
a
groan
of
her
last
breath
and
now
she
sings
in
heaven
How
is
this
justified
The
stronger
part
of
it
by
her
own
letters
which
makes
her
story
true
even
to
the
point
of
her
death
Her
death
itself
which
could
not
be
her
office
to
say
is
come
was
faithfully
confirmd
by
the
rector
of
the
place
Hath
the
Count
all
this
intelligence
Ay
and
the
particular
confirmations
point
from
point
to
the
full
arming
of
the
verity
I
am
heartily
sorry
that
hell
be
glad
of
this
How
mightily
sometimes
we
make
us
comforts
of
our
losses
And
how
mightily
some
other
times
we
drown
our
gain
in
tears
The
great
dignity
that
his
valour
hath
here
acquird
for
him
shall
at
home
be
encountred
with
a
shame
as
ample
The
web
of
our
life
is
of
a
mingled
yarn
good
and
ill
together
Our
virtues
would
be
proud
if
our
faults
whipt
them
not
and
our
crimes
would
despair
if
they
were
not
cherishd
by
our
virtues
Enter
a
How
now
Wheres
your
master
He
met
the
Duke
in
the
street
sir
of
whom
he
hath
taken
a
solemn
leave
His
lordship
will
next
morning
for
France
The
Duke
hath
offered
him
letters
of
commendations
to
the
King
They
shall
be
no
more
than
needful
there
if
they
were
more
than
they
can
commend
They
cannot
be
too
sweet
for
the
Kings
tartness
Heres
his
lordship
now
Enter
How
now
my
lord
ist
not
after
midnight
I
have
tonight
dispatchd
sixteen
businesses
a
months
length
apiece
by
an
abstract
of
success
I
have
congied
with
the
Duke
done
my
adieu
with
his
nearest
buried
a
wife
mournd
for
her
writ
to
my
lady
mother
I
am
returning
entertaind
my
convoy
and
between
these
main
parcels
of
dispatch
effected
many
nicer
needs
The
last
was
the
greatest
but
that
I
have
not
ended
yet
If
the
business
be
of
any
difficulty
and
this
morning
your
departure
hence
it
requires
haste
of
your
lordship
I
mean
the
business
is
not
ended
as
fearing
to
hear
of
it
hereafter
But
shall
we
have
this
dialogue
between
the
Fool
and
the
Soldier
Come
bring
forth
this
counterfeit
module
has
deceivd
me
like
a
doublemeaning
prophesier
Bring
him
forth
stocks
all
night
poor
gallant
knave
No
matter
his
heels
have
deservd
it
in
usurping
his
spurs
so
long
How
does
he
carry
himself
I
have
told
your
lordship
already
the
stocks
carry
him
But
to
answer
you
as
you
would
be
understood
he
weeps
like
a
wench
that
had
shed
her
milk
he
hath
confessd
himself
to
Morgan
whom
he
supposes
to
be
a
friar
from
the
time
of
his
remembrance
to
this
very
instant
disaster
of
his
setting
i
th
stocks
And
what
think
you
he
hath
confessd
Nothing
of
me
has
a
His
confession
is
taken
and
it
shall
be
read
to
his
face
if
your
lordship
be
int
as
I
believe
you
are
you
must
have
the
patience
to
hear
it
Enter
guarded
and
as
interpreter
plague
upon
him
muffled
He
can
say
nothing
of
me
Hush
hush
Hoodman
comes
Portotartarossa
He
calls
for
the
tortures
What
will
you
say
without
em
I
will
confess
what
I
know
without
constraint
if
ye
pinch
me
like
a
pasty
I
can
say
no
more
Bosko

Our
General

strong
What
say

The

my
reputation
and
credit
and
as
I

gallant

phrasethat
had
the
whole
theoric
of
war
in
the
knot
of
his
scarf
and
the
practice
in
the
chape
of
his
dagger
I
will
never
trust
a
man
again
for
keeping
his
sword
clean
nor
believe
he
can
have
everything
in
him
by
wearing
his
apparel
neatly
Well

Five
or
six

Hes

near
the
truth
in
this
But
I

Poor

Demand
of
him
of
what
strength
they
are
afoot
What
say
you
to
that
By
my
troth
sir
if
I
were
to
live
this
present
hour
I
will
tell
true
Let
me
see
Spurio
a
hundred
and
fifty
Sebastian
so
many
Corambus
so
many
Jaques
so
many
Guiltian
Cosmo
Lodowick
and
Gratii
two
hundred
fifty
each
mine
own
company
Chitopher
Vaumond
Bentii
two
hundred
fifty
each
so
that
the
musterfile
rotten
and
sound
upon
my
life
amounts
not
to
fifteen
thousand
poll
half
of
the
which
dare
not
shake
the
snow
from
off
their
cassocks
lest
they
shake
themselves
to
pieces
What
shall
be
done
to
him
Nothing
but
let
him
have
thanks
Demand
of
him
my
condition
and
what
credit
I
have
with
the
Duke
Well
thats
set
down
You
shall
demand
of
him
whether
one
Captain
Dumain
be
i
th
camp
a
Frenchman
what
his
reputation
is
with
the
Duke
what
his
valour
honesty
expertness
in
wars
or
whether
he
thinks
it
were
not
possible
with
wellweighing
sums
of
gold
to
corrupt
him
to
a
revolt
What
say
you
to
this
What
do
you
know
of
it
I
beseech
you
let
me
answer
to
the
particular
of
the
intergatories
Demand
them
singly
Do
you
know
this
Captain
Dumain
I
know
him
a
was
a
botchers
prentice
in
Paris
from
whence
he
was
whipt
for
getting
the
shrieves
fool
with
childa
dumb
innocent
that
could
not
say
him
nay
Nay
by
your
leave
hold
your
hands
though
I
know
his
brains
are
forfeit
to
the
next
tile
that
falls
Well
is
this
captain
in
the
Duke
of
Florences
camp
Upon
my
knowledge
he
is
and
lousy
Nay
look
not
so
upon
me
we
shall
hear
of
your
lordship
anon
What
is
his
reputation
with
the
Duke
The
Duke
knows
him
for
no
other
but
a
poor
officer
of
mine
and
writ
to
me
this
other
day
to
turn
him
out
o
th
band
I
think
I
have
his
letter
in
my
pocket
Marry
well
search
In
good
sadness
I
do
not
know
either
it
is
there
or
it
is
upon
a
file
with
the
Dukes
other
letters
in
my
tent
Here
tis
heres
a
paper
Shall
I
read
it
to
you
I
do
not
know
if
it
be
it
or
no
Our
interpreter
does
it
well
Excellently
Reads
Dian
the
Counts
a
fool
and
full
of
gold
That
is
not
the
Dukes
letter
sir
that
is
an
advertisement
to
a
proper
maid
in
Florence
one
Diana
to
take
heed
of
the
allurement
of
one
Count
Rousillon
a
foolish
idle
boy
but
for
all
that
very
ruttish
I
pray
you
sir
put
it
up
again
Nay
Ill
read
it
first
by
your
favour
My
meaning
int
I
protest
was
very
honest
in
the
behalf
of
the
maid
for
I
knew
the
young
Count
to
be
a
dangerous
and
lascivious
boy
who
is
a
whale
to
virginity
and
devours
up
all
the
fry
it
finds
Damnable
bothsides
rogue
Reads
When
he
swears
oaths
bid
him
drop
gold
and
take
it
After
he
scores
he
never
pays
the
score
Half
won
is
match
well
made
match
and
well
make
it
He
neer
pays
afterdebts
take
it
before
And
say
a
soldier
Dian
told
thee
this
Men
are
to
mell
with
boys
are
not
to
kiss
For
count
of
this
the
Counts
a
fool
I
know
it
Who
pays
before
but
not
when
he
does
owe
it
Thine
as
he
vowd
to
thee
in
thine
ear
He
shall
be
whipt
through
the
army
with
this
rhyme
ins
forehead
This
is
your
devoted
friend
sir
the
manifold
linguist
and
the
amnipotent
soldier
I
could
endure
anything
before
but
a
cat
and
now
hes
a
cat
to
me
I
perceive
sir
by
our
Generals
looks
we
shall
be
fain
to
hang
you
My
life
sir
in
any
case
Not
that
I
am
afraid
to
die
but
that
my
offences
being
many
I
would
repent
out
the
remainder
of
nature
Let
me
live
sir
in
a
dungeon
i
th
stocks
or
anywhere
so
I
may
live
Well
see
what
may
be
done
so
you
confess
freely
therefore
once
more
to
this
Captain
Dumain
you
have
answerd
to
his
reputation
with
the
Duke
and
to
his
valour
what
is
his
honesty
He
will
steal
sir
an
egg
out
of
a
cloister
for
rapes
and
ravishments
he
parallels
Nessus
He
professes
not
keeping
of
oaths
in
breaking
em
he
is
stronger
than
Hercules
He
will
lie
sir
with
such
volubility
that
you
would
think
truth
were
a
fool
Drunkenness
is
his
best
virtue
for
he
will
be
swinedrunk
and
in
his
sleep
he
does
little
harm
save
to
his
bedclothes
about
him
but
they
know
his
conditions
and
lay
him
in
straw
I
have
but
little
more
to
say
sir
of
his
honesty
He
has
everything
that
an
honest
man
should
not
have
what
an
honest
man
should
have
he
has
nothing
I
begin
to
love
him
for
this
For
this
description
of
thine
honesty
pox
upon
him
For
me
hes
more
and
more
a
cat
What
say
you
to
his
expertness
in
war
Faith
sir
has
led
the
drum
before
the
English
tragediansto
belie
him
I
will
notand
more
of
his
soldiership
I
know
not
except
in
that
country
he
had
the
honour
to
be
the
officer
at
a
place
there
called
Mileend
to
instruct
for
the
doubling
of
filesI
would
do
the
man
what
honour
I
canbut
of
this
I
am
not
certain
He
hath
outvillaind
villainy
so
far
that
the
rarity
redeems
him
pox
on
him
hes
a
cat
still
His
qualities
being
at
this
poor
price
I
need
not
to
ask
you
if
gold
will
corrupt
him
to
revolt
Sir
for
a
cardecue
he
will
sell
the
feesimple
of
his
salvation
the
inheritance
of
it
and
cut
th
entail
from
all
remainders
and
a
perpetual
succession
for
it
perpetually
Whats
his
brother
the
other
Captain
Dumain
Why
does
he
ask
him
of
me
Whats
he
Een
a
crow
o
th
same
nest
not
altogether
so
great
as
the
first
in
goodness
but
greater
a
great
deal
in
evil
He
excels
his
brother
for
a
coward
yet
his
brother
is
reputed
one
of
the
best
that
is
In
a
retreat
he
outruns
any
lackey
marry
in
coming
on
he
has
the
cramp
If
your
life
be
saved
will
you
undertake
to
betray
the
Florentine
Ay
and
the
Captain
of
his
Horse
Count
Rousillon
Ill
whisper
with
the
General
and
know
his
pleasure
Aside
Ill
no
more
drumming
plague
of
all
drums
Only
to
seem
to
deserve
well
and
to
beguile
the
supposition
of
that
lascivious
young
boy
the
Count
have
I
run
into
this
danger
Yet
who
would
have
suspected
an
ambush
where
I
was
taken
There
is
no
remedy
sir
but
you
must
die
The
General
says
you
that
have
so
traitorously
discoverd
the
secrets
of
your
army
and
made
such
pestiferous
reports
of
men
very
nobly
held
can
serve
the
world
for
no
honest
use
therefore
you
must
die
Come
headsman
of
with
his
head
Lord
sir
let
me
live
or
let
me
see
my
death
That
shall
you
and
take
your
leave
of
all
your
friends
Unmuffling
him
So
look
about
you
know
you
any
here
Good
morrow
noble
Captain
God
bless
you
Captain
Parolles
God
save
you
noble
Captain
Captain
what
greeting
will
you
to
my
Lord
Lafeu
I
am
for
France
Good
Captain
will
you
give
me
a
copy
of
the
sonnet
you
writ
to
Diana
in
behalf
of
the
Count
Rousillon
An
I
were
not
a
very
coward
Id
compel
it
of
you
but
fare
you
well
You
are
undone
Captain
all
but
your
scarf
that
has
a
knot
on
t
yet
Who
cannot
be
crushd
with
a
plot
If
you
could
find
out
a
country
where
but
women
were
that
had
received
so
much
shame
you
might
begin
an
impudent
nation
Fare
ye
well
sir
I
am
for
France
too
we
shall
speak
of
you
there
Yet
am
I
thankful
If
my
heart
were
great
Twould
burst
at
this
Captain
Ill
be
no
more
But
I
will
eat
and
drink
and
sleep
as
soft
As
captain
shall
Simply
the
thing
I
am
Shall
make
me
live
Who
knows
himself
a
braggart
Let
him
fear
this
for
it
will
come
to
pass
That
every
braggart
shall
be
found
an
ass
Rust
sword
cool
blushes
and
Parolles
live
Safest
in
shame
Being
foold
by
foolry
thrive
Theres
place
and
means
for
every
man
alive
Ill
after
them
The
house
Enter
and
That
you
may
well
perceive
I
have
not
wrongd
you
One
of
the
greatest
in
the
Christian
world
Shall
be
my
surety
fore
whose
throne
tis
needful
Ere
I
can
perfect
mine
intents
to
kneel
Time
was
I
did
him
a
desired
office
Dear
almost
as
his
life
which
gratitude
Through
flinty
Tartars
bosom
would
peep
forth
And
answer
Thanks
I
duly
am
informd
His
Grace
is
at
Marseilles
to
which
place
We
have
convenient
convoy
You
must
know
I
am
supposed
dead
The
army
breaking
My
husband
hies
him
home
where
heaven
aiding
And
by
the
leave
of
my
good
lord
the
King
Well
be
before
our
welcome
Gentle
madam
You
never
had
a
servant
to
whose
trust
Your
business
was
more
welcome
Nor
you
mistress
Ever
a
friend
whose
thoughts
more
truly
labour
To
recompense
your
love
Doubt
not
but
heaven
Hath
brought
me
up
to
be
your
daughters
dower
As
it
hath
fated
her
to
be
my
motive
And
helper
to
a
husband
But
strange
men
That
can
such
sweet
use
make
of
what
they
hate
When
saucy
trusting
of
the
cozend
thoughts
Defiles
the
pitchy
night
So
lust
doth
play
With
what
it
loathes
for
that
which
is
away
But
more
of
this
hereafter
You
Diana
Under
my
poor
instructions
yet
must
suffer
Something
in
my
behalf
Let
death
and
honesty
Go
with
your
impositions
I
am
yours
Upon
your
will
to
suffer
Yet
I
pray
you
But
with
the
word
the
time
will
bring
on
summer
When
briers
shall
have
leaves
as
well
as
thorns
And
be
as
sweet
as
sharp
We
must
away
Our
waggon
is
prepard
and
time
revives
us
Alls
Well
that
Ends
Well
Still
the
fines
the
crown
Whateer
the
course
the
end
is
the
renown
Rousillon
The
palace
Enter
and
No
no
no
son
was
misled
with
a
snipttaffeta
fellow
there
whose
villainous
saffron
would
have
made
all
the
unbakd
and
doughy
youth
of
a
nation
in
his
colour
Your
daughterinlaw
had
been
alive
at
this
hour
and
your
son
here
at
home
more
advancd
by
the
King
than
by
that
redtaild
humblebee
I
speak
of
I
would
I
had
not
known
him
It
was
the
death
of
the
most
virtuous
gentlewoman
that
ever
nature
had
praise
for
creating
If
she
had
partaken
of
my
flesh
and
cost
me
the
dearest
groans
of
a
mother
I
could
not
have
owed
her
a
more
rooted
love
Twas
a
good
lady
twas
a
good
lady
We
may
pick
a
thousand
sallets
ere
we
light
on
such
another
herb
Indeed
sir
she
was
the
sweetmarjoram
of
the
sallet
or
rather
the
herb
of
grace
They
are
not
salletherbs
you
knave
they
are
noseherbs
I
am
no
great
Nebuchadnezzar
sir
I
have
not
much
skill
in
grass
Whether
dost
thou
profess
thyselfa
knave
or
a
fool
fool
sir
at
a
womans
service
and
a
knave
at
a
mans
Your
distinction
I
would
cozen
the
man
of
his
wife
and
do
his
service
So
you
were
a
knave
at
his
service
indeed
And
I
would
give
his
wife
my
bauble
sir
to
do
her
service
I
will
subscribe
for
thee
thou
art
both
knave
and
fool
At
your
service
No
no
no
Why
sir
if
I
cannot
serve
you
I
can
serve
as
great
a
prince
as
you
are
Whos
that
Frenchman
Faith
sir
a
has
an
English
name
but
his
fisnomy
is
more
hotter
in
France
than
there
What
prince
is
that
The
Black
Prince
sir
alias
the
Prince
of
Darkness
alias
the
devil
Hold
thee
theres
my
purse
I
give
thee
not
this
to
suggest
thee
from
thy
master
thou
talkst
of
serve
him
still
I
am
a
woodland
fellow
sir
that
always
loved
a
great
fire
and
the
master
I
speak
of
ever
keeps
a
good
fire
But
sure
he
is
the
prince
of
the
world
let
his
nobility
remain
ins
court
I
am
for
the
house
with
the
narrow
gate
which
I
take
to
be
too
little
for
pomp
to
enter
Some
that
humble
themselves
may
but
the
many
will
be
too
chill
and
tender
and
theyll
be
for
the
flowry
way
that
leads
to
the
broad
gate
and
the
great
fire
Go
thy
ways
I
begin
to
be
aweary
of
thee
and
I
tell
thee
so
before
because
I
would
not
fall
out
with
thee
Go
thy
ways
let
my
horses
be
well
lookd
to
without
any
tricks
If
I
put
any
tricks
upon
em
sir
they
shall
be
jades
tricks
which
are
their
own
right
by
the
law
of
nature
shrewd
knave
and
an
unhappy
So
a
is
My
lord
thats
gone
made
himself
much
sport
out
of
him
By
his
authority
he
remains
here
which
he
thinks
is
a
patent
for
his
sauciness
and
indeed
he
has
no
pace
but
runs
where
he
will
I
like
him
well
tis
not
amiss
And
I
was
about
to
tell
you
since
I
heard
of
the
good
ladys
death
and
that
my
lord
your
son
was
upon
his
return
home
I
moved
the
King
my
master
to
speak
in
the

a
patch
of
velvet
ons
face
whether
there
be
a
scar
under

the
velvet
knows
but
tis
a
goodly
patch
of
velvet
His
left
cheek
is
a
cheek
of
two
pile
and
a
half
but
his
right
cheek
is
worn
bare
scar
nobly
got

a
noble

unclean
fishpond
of

muddied
withal
Pray

Fortune

would
you
have
me
to
do
Tis
too
late
to
pare
her
nails
now
Wherein
have
you
played
the
knave
with
Fortune
that
she
should
scratch
you

of
herself
is
a
good
lady
and

How

good
lord

first
that

Was

And
I
was
the
first
that
lost
thee
It
lies
in
you
my
lord
to
bring
me
in
some
grace
for
you
did
bring
me
out
Out
upon
thee
knave
Dost

put
upon
me
at
once
both
the
office
of
God
and
the
devil
One

Go

Rousillon
The
palace
Flourish
Enter
the
two
with
We
lost
a
jewel
of
her
and
our
esteem
Was
made
much
poorer
by
it
but
your
son
As
mad
in
folly
lackd
the
sense
to
know
Her
estimation
home
Tis
past
my
liege
And
I
beseech
your
Majesty
to
make
it
Natural
rebellion
done
i
th
blaze
of
youth
When
oil
and
fire
too
strong
for
reasons
force
Oerbears
it
and
burns
on
My
honourd
lady
I
have
forgiven
and
forgotten
all
Though
my
revenges
were
high
bent
upon
him
And
watchd
the
time
to
shoot
This
I
must
say
But
first
I
beg
my
pardon
the
young
lord
Did
to
his
Majesty
his
mother
and
his
lady
Offence
of
mighty
note
but
to
himself
The
greatest
wrong
of
all
He
lost
a
wife
Whose
beauty
did
astonish
the
survey
Of
richest
eyes
whose
words
all
ears
took
captive
Whose
dear
perfection
hearts
that
scornd
to
serve
Humbly
calld
mistress
Praising
what
is
lost
Makes
the
remembrance
dear
Well
call
him
hither
We
are
reconcild
and
the
first
view
shall
kill
All
repetition
Let
him
not
ask
our
pardon
The
nature
of
his
great
offence
is
dead
And
deeper
than
oblivion
do
we
bury
Th
incensing
relics
of
it
let
him
approach
stranger
no
offender
and
inform
him
So
tis
our
will
he
should
I
shall
my
liege
What
says
he
to
your
daughter
Have
you
spoke
All
that
he
is
hath
reference
to
your
Highness
Then
shall
we
have
a
match
I
have
letters
sent
me
That
sets
him
high
in
fame
Enter
He
looks
well
on
t
I
am
not
a
day
of
season
For
thou
mayst
see
a
sunshine
and
a
hail
In
me
at
once
But
to
the
brightest
beams
Distracted
clouds
give
way
so
stand
thou
forth
The
time
is
fair
again
My
highrepented
blames
Dear
sovereign
pardon
to
me
All
is
whole
Not
one
word
more
of
the
consumed
time
Lets
take
the
instant
by
the
forward
top
For
we
are
old
and
on
our
quickst
decrees
Th
inaudible
and
noiseless
foot
of
Time
Steals
ere
we
can
effect
them
You
remember
The
daughter
of
this
lord
Admiringly
my
liege
At
first
I
stuck
my
choice
upon
her
ere
my
heart
Durst
make
too
bold
herald
of
my
tongue
Where
the
impression
of
mine
eye
infixing
Contempt
his
scornful
perspective
did
lend
me
Which
warpd
the
line
of
every
other
favour
Scornd
a
fair
colour
or
expressd
it
stoln
Extended
or
contracted
all
proportions
To
a
most
hideous
object
Thence
it
came
That
she
whom
all
men
praisd
and
whom
myself
Since
I
have
lost
have
lovd
was
in
mine
eye
The
dust
that
did
offend
it
Well
excusd
That
thou
didst
love
her
strikes
some
scores
away
From
the
great
compt
but
love
that
comes
too
late
Like
a
remorseful
pardon
slowly
carried
To
the
great
sender
turns
a
sour
offence
Crying
Thats
good
thats
gone
Our
rash
faults
Make
trivial
price
of
serious
things
we
have
Not
knowing
them
until
we
know
their
grave
Oft
our
displeasures
to
ourselves
unjust
Destroy
our
friends
and
after
weep
their
dust
Our
own
love
waking
cries
to
see
whats
done
While
shameful
hate
sleeps
out
the
afternoon
Be
this
sweet
Helens
knell
And
now
forget
her
Send
forth
your
amorous
token
for
fair
Maudlin
The
main
consents
are
had
and
here
well
stay
To
see
our
widowers
second
marriageday
Which
better
than
the
first
dear
heaven
bless
Or
ere
they
meet
in
me
nature
cesse
Come
on
my
son
in
whom
my
houses
name
Must
be
digested
give
a
favour
from
you
To
sparkle
in
the
spirits
of
my
daughter
That
she
may
quickly
come
gives
a
ring
By
my
old
beard
And
evry
hair
thats
on
t
Helen
thats
dead
Was
a
sweet
creature
such
a
ring
as
this
The
last
that
eer
I
took
her
leave
at
court
I
saw
upon
her
finger
Hers
it
was
not
Now
pray
you
let
me
see
it
for
mine
eye
While
I
was
speaking
oft
was
fastend
tot
This
ring
was
mine
and
when
I
gave
it
Helen
I
bade
her
if
her
fortunes
ever
stood
Necessitied
to
help
that
by
this
token
I
would
relieve
her
Had
you
that
craft
to
reave
her
Of
what
should
stead
her
most
My
gracious
sovereign
Howeer
it
pleases
you
to
take
it
so
The
ring
was
never
hers
Son
on
my
life
I
have
seen
her
wear
it
and
she
reckond
it
At
her
lifes
rate
I
am
sure
I
saw
her
wear
it
You
are
deceivd
my
lord
she
never
saw
it
In
Florence
was
it
from
a
casement
thrown
me
Wrappd
in
a
paper
which
containd
the
name
Of
her
that
threw
it
Noble
she
was
and
thought
I
stood
engagd
but
when
I
had
subscribd
To
mine
own
fortune
and
informd
her
fully
I
could
not
answer
in
that
course
of
honour
As
she
had
made
the
overture
she
ceasd
In
heavy
satisfaction
and
would
never
Receive
the
ring
again
Plutus
himself
That
knows
the
tinct
and
multiplying
medcine
Hath
not
in
natures
mystery
more
science
Than
I
have
in
this
ring
Twas
mine
twas
Helens
Whoever
gave
it
you
Then
if
you
know
That
you
are
well
acquainted
with
yourself
Confess
twas
hers
and
by
what
rough
enforcement
You
got
it
from
her
She
calld
the
saints
to
surety
That
she
would
never
put
it
from
her
finger
Unless
she
gave
it
to
yourself
in
bed
Where
you
have
never
come
or
sent
it
us
Upon
her
great
disaster
She
never
saw
it
Thou
speakst
it
falsely
as
I
love
mine
honour
And
makst
conjectural
fears
to
come
into
me
Which
I
would
fain
shut
out
If
it
should
prove
That
thou
art
so
inhuman
twill
not
prove
so
And
yet
I
know
not
thou
didst
hate
her
deadly
And
she
is
dead
which
nothing
but
to
close
Her
eyes
myself
could
win
me
to
believe
More
than
to
see
this
ring
Take
him
away
seize
My
forepast
proofs
howeer
the
matter
fall
Shall
tax
my
fears
of
little
vanity
Having
vainly
feard
too
little
Away
with
him
Well
sift
this
matter
further
If
you
shall
prove
This
ring
was
ever
hers
you
shall
as
easy
Prove
that
I
husbanded
her
bed
in
Florence
Where
she
yet
never
was
I
am
wrappd
in
dismal
thinkings
Enter
a
Gracious
sovereign
Whether
I
have
been
to
blame
or
no
I
know
not
Heres
a
petition
from
a
Florentine
Who
hath
for
four
or
five
removes
come
short
To
tender
it
herself
I
undertook
it
Vanquishd
thereto
by
the
fair
grace
and
speech
Of
the
poor
suppliant
who
by
this
I
know
Is
here
attending
her
business
looks
in
her
With
an
importing
visage
and
she
told
me
In
a
sweet
verbal
brief
it
did
concern
Your
Highness
with
herself
Reads
the
letter
Upon
his
many
protestations
to
marry
me
when
his
wife
was
dead
I
blush
to
say
it
he
won
me
Now
is
the
Count
Rousillon
a
widower
his
vows
are
forfeited
to
me
and
my
honours
paid
to
him
He
stole
from
Florence
taking
no
leave
and
I
follow
him
to
his
country
for
justice
Grant
it
me
King
in
you
it
best
lies
otherwise
a
seducer
flourishes
and
a
poor
maid
is
undone
I
will
buy
me
a
soninlaw
in
a
fair
and
toll
for
this
Ill
none
of
him
The
heavens
have
thought
well
on
thee
Lafeu
To
bring
forth
this
discovry
Seek
these
suitors
Go
speedily
and
bring
again
the
Count
I
am
afeard
the
life
of
Helen
lady
Was
foully
snatchd
Now
justice
on
the
doers
Enter
guarded
I
wonder
sir
sith
wives
are
monsters
to
you
And
that
you
fly
them
as
you
swear
them
lordship
Yet
you
desire
to
marry
Enter
and
What
womans
that
I
am
my
lord
a
wretched
Florentine
Derived
from
the
ancient
Capilet
My
suit
as
I
do
understand
you
know
And
therefore
know
how
far
I
may
be
pitied
I
am
her
mother
sir
whose
age
and
honour
Both
suffer
under
this
complaint
we
bring
And
both
shall
cease
without
your
remedy
Come
hither
Count
do
you
know
these
women
My
lord
I
neither
can
nor
will
deny
But
that
I
know
them
Do
they
charge
me
further
Why
do
you
look
so
strange
upon
your
wife
Shes
none
of
mine
my
lord
If
you
shall
marry
You
give
away
this
hand
and
that
is
mine
You
give
away
heavens
vows
and
those
are
mine
You
give
away
myself
which
is
known
mine
For
I
by
vow
am
so
embodied
yours
That
she
which
marries
you
must
marry
me
Either
both
or
none
To
Your
reputation
comes
too
short
for
my
daughter
you
are
no
husband
for
her
My
lord
this
is
a
fond
and
desprate
creature
Whom
sometime
I
have
laughd
with
Let
your
Highness
Lay
a
more
noble
thought
upon
mine
honour
Than
for
to
think
that
I
would
sink
it
here
Sir
for
my
thoughts
you
have
them
ill
to
friend
Till
your
deeds
gain
them
Fairer
prove
your
honour
Than
in
my
thought
it
lies
Good
my
lord
Ask
him
upon
his
oath
if
he
does
think
He
had
not
my
virginity
What
sayst
thou
to
her
Shes
impudent
my
lord
And
was
a
common
gamester
to
the
camp
He
does
me
wrong
my
lord
if
I
were
so
He
might
have
bought
me
at
a
common
price
Do
not
believe
him
o
behold
this
ring
Whose
high
respect
and
rich
validity
Did
lack
a
parallel
yet
for
all
that
He
gave
it
to
a
commoner
o
th
camp
If
I
be
one
He
blushes
and
tis
it
Of
six
preceding
ancestors
that
gem
Conferrd
by
testament
to
th
sequent
issue
Hath
it
been
owd
and
worn
This
is
his
wife
That
rings
a
thousand
proofs
Methought
you
said
You
saw
one
here
in
court
could
witness
it
I
did
my
lord
but
loath
am
to
produce
So
bad
an
instrument
his
names
Parolles
I
saw
the
man
today
if
man
he
be
Find
him
and
bring
him
hither
What
of
him
Hes
quoted
for
a
most
perfidious
slave
With
all
the
spots
o
th
world
taxd
and
debauchd
Whose
nature
sickens
but
to
speak
a
truth
Am
I
or
that
or
this
for
what
hell
utter
That
will
speak
anything
She
hath
that
ring
of
yours
I
think
she
has
Certain
it
is
I
likd
her
And
boarded
her
i
th
wanton
way
of
youth
She
knew
her
distance
and
did
angle
for
me
Madding
my
eagerness
with
her
restraint
As
all
impediments
in
fancys
course
Are
motives
of
more
fancy
and
in
fine
Her
infinite
cunning
with
her
modern
grace
Subdud
me
to
her
rate
She
got
the
ring
And
I
had
that
which
any
inferior
might
At
marketprice
have
bought
I
must
be
patient
You
that
have
turnd
off
a
first
so
noble
wife
May
justly
diet
me
I
pray
you
yet
Since
you
lack
virtue
I
will
lose
a
husband
Send
for
your
ring
I
will
return
it
home
And
give
me
mine
again
I
have
it
not
What
ring
was
yours
I
pray
you
Sir
much
like
The
same
upon
your
finger
Know
you
this
ring
This
ring
was
his
of
late
And
this
was
it
I
gave
him
being
abed
The
story
then
goes
false
you
threw
it
him
Out
of
a
casement
I
have
spoke
the
truth
Enter
My
lord
I
do
confess
the
ring
was
hers
You
boggle
shrewdly
every
feather
starts
you
Is
this
the
man
you
speak
of
Ay
my
lord
Tell
me
sirrahbut
tell
me
true
I
charge
you
Not
fearing
the
displeasure
of
your
master
Which
on
your
just
proceeding
Ill
keep
off
By
him
and
by
this
woman
here
what
know
you
So
please
your
Majesty
my
master
hath
been
an
honourable
gentleman
tricks
he
hath
had
in
him
which
gentlemen
have
Come
come
to
th
purpose
Did
he
love
this
woman
Faith
sir
he
did
love
her
but
how
How
I
pray
you
He
did
love
her
sir
as
a
gentleman
loves
a
woman
How
is
that
He
lovd
her
sir
and
lovd
her
not
As
thou
art
a
knave
and
no
knave
What
an
equivocal
companion
is
this
I
am
a
poor
man
and
at
your
Majestys
command
Hes
a
good
drum
my
lord
but
a
naughty
orator
Do
you
know
he
promisd
me
marriage
Faith
I
know
more
than
Ill
speak
But
wilt
thou
not
speak
all
thou
knowst
Yes
so
please
your
Majesty
I
did
go
between
them
as
I
said
but
more
than
that
he
loved
herfor
indeed
he
was
mad
for
her
and
talkd
of
Satan
and
of
Limbo
and
of
Furies
and
I
know
not
what
Yet
I
was
in
that
credit
with
them
at
that
time
that
I
knew
of
their
going
to
bed
and
of
other
motions
as
promising
her
marriage
and
things
which
would
derive
me
ill
will
to
speak
of
therefore
I
will
not
speak
what
I
know
Thou
hast
spoken
all
already
unless
thou
canst
say
they
are
married
but
thou
art
too
fine
in
thy
evidence
therefore
stand
aside
This
ring
you
say
was
yours
Ay
my
good
lord
Where
did
you
buy
it
Or
who
gave
it
you
It
was
not
given
me
nor
I
did
not
buy
it
Who
lent
it
you
It
was
not
lent
me
neither
Where
did
you
find
it
then
I
found
it
not
If
it
were
yours
by
none
of
all
these
ways
How
could
you
give
it
him
I
never
gave
it
him
This
womans
an
easy
glove
my
lord
she
goes
of
and
on
at
pleasure
This
ring
was
mine
I
gave
it
his
first
wife
It
might
be
yours
or
hers
for
aught
I
know
Take
her
away
I
do
not
like
her
now
To
prison
with
her
And
away
with
him
Unless
thou
tellst
me
where
thou
hadst
this
ring
Thou
diest
within
this
hour
Ill
never
tell
you
Take
her
away
Ill
put
in
bail
my
liege
I
think
thee
now
some
common
customer
By
Jove
if
ever
I
knew
man
twas
you
Wherefore
hast
thou
accusd
him
all
this
while
Because
hes
guilty
and
he
is
not
guilty
He
knows
I
am
no
maid
and
hell
swear
tot
Ill
swear
I
am
a
maid
and
he
knows
not
Great
King
I
am
no
strumpet
by
my
life
I
am
either
maid
or
else
this
old
mans
wife
Pointing
to
She
does
abuse
our
ears
to
prison
with
her
Good
mother
fetch
my
bail
Stay
royal
sir
The
jeweller
that
owes
the
ring
is
sent
for
And
he
shall
surety
me
But
for
this
lord
Who
hath
abusd
me
as
he
knows
himself
Though
yet
he
never
harmd
me
here
I
quit
him
He
knows
himself
my
bed
he
hath
defild
And
at
that
time
he
got
his
wife
with
child
Dead
though
she
be
she
feels
her
young
one
kick
So
theres
my
riddle
one
thats
dead
is
quick
And
now
behold
the
meaning
Reenter
with
Is
there
no
exorcist
Beguiles
the
truer
office
of
mine
eyes
Ist
real
that
I
see
No
my
good
lord
Tis
but
the
shadow
of
a
wife
you
see
The
name
and
not
the
thing
Both
both
o
pardon
my
good
lord
when
I
was
like
this
maid
I
found
you
wondrous
kind
There
is
your
ring
And
look
you
heres
your
letter
This
it
says
When
from
my
finger
you
can
get
this
ring
And
are
by
me
with
child
etc
This
is
done
Will
you
be
mine
now
you
are
doubly
won
If
she
my
liege
can
make
me
know
this
clearly
Ill
love
her
dearly
ever
ever
dearly
If
it
appear
not
plain
and
prove
untrue
Deadly
divorce
step
between
me
and
you
my
dear
mother
do
I
see
you
living
Mine
eyes
smell
onions
I
shall
weep
anon
To
Good
Tom
Drum
lend
me
a
handkercher
So
I
thank
thee
Wait
on
me
home
Ill
make
sport
with
thee
let
thy
curtsies
alone
they
are
scurvy
ones
Let
us
from
point
to
point
this
story
know
To
make
the
even
truth
in
pleasure
flow
To
If
thou
beest
yet
a
fresh
uncropped
flower
Choose
thou
thy
husband
and
Ill
pay
thy
dower
For
I
can
guess
that
by
thy
honest
aid
Thou
keptst
a
wife
herself
thyself
a
maid
Of
that
and
all
the
progress
more
and
less
Resolvedly
more
leisure
shall
express
All
yet
seems
well
and
if
it
end
so
meet
The
bitter
past
more
welcome
is
the
sweet
Flourish
The
Kings
a
beggar
now
the
play
is
done
All
is
well
ended
if
this
suit
be
won
That
you
express
content
which
we
will
pay
With
strife
to
please
you
day
exceeding
day
Ours
be
your
patience
then
and
yours
our
parts
Your
gentle
hands
lend

and
take
our
hearts
I
I
Alexandria
palace
Enter
and
Nay
but
this
dotage
of
our
generals
Oerflows
the
measure
Those
his
goodly
eyes
That
oer
the
files
and
musters
of
the
war
Have
glowd
like
plated
Mars
now
bend
now
turn
The
office
and
devotion
of
their
view
Upon
a
tawny
front
His
captains
heart
Which
in
the
scuffles
of
great
fights
hath
burst
The
buckles
on
his
breast
reneges
all
temper
And
is
become
the
bellows
and
the
fan
To
cool
a
gipsys
lust
Flourish
Enter
her
the
train
with
eunuchs
fanning
her
Look
where
they
come
Take
but
good
note
and
you
shall
see
in
him
The
triple
pillar
of
the
world
transformd
Into
a
strumpets
fool
Behold
and
see
If
it
be
love
indeed
tell
me
how
much
Theres
beggary
in
the
love
that
can
be
reckond
Ill
set
a
bourn
how
far
to
be
belovd
Then
must
thou
needs
find
out
new
heaven
new
earth
Enter
a
News
my
good
lord
from
Rome
Grates
me
the
sum
Nay
hear
them
Antony
Fulvia
perchance
is
angry
or
who
knows
If
the
scarcebearded
Caesar
have
not
sent
His
powrful
mandate
to
you
Do
this
or
this
Take
in
that
kingdom
and
enfranchise
that
Performt
or
else
we
damn
thee
How
my
love
Perchance
Nay
and
most
like
You
must
not
stay
here
longer
your
dismission
Is
come
from
Caesar
therefore
hear
it
Antony
Wheres
Fulvias
process
Caesars
I
would
say
Both
Call
in
the
messengers
As
I
am
Egypts
Queen
Thou
blushest
Antony
and
that
blood
of
thine
Is
Caesars
homager
Else
so
thy
cheek
pays
shame
When
shrilltongud
Fulvia
scolds
The
messengers
Let
Rome
in
Tiber
melt
and
the
wide
arch
Of
the
rangd
empire
fall
Here
is
my
space
Kingdoms
are
clay
our
dungy
earth
alike
Feeds
beast
as
man
The
nobleness
of
life
Is
to
do
thus
emhracing
when
such
a
mutual
pair
And
such
a
twain
can
dot
in
which
I
bind
On
pain
of
punishment
the
world
to
weet
We
stand
up
peerless
Excellent
falsehood
Why
did
he
marry
Fulvia
and
not
love
her
Ill
seem
the
fool
I
am
not
Antony
Will
be
himself
But
stirrd
by
Cleopatra
Now
for
the
love
of
Love
and
her
soft
hours
Lets
not
confound
the
time
with
conference
harsh
Theres
not
a
minute
of
our
lives
should
stretch
Without
some
pleasure
now
What
sport
tonight
Hear
the
ambassadors
Fie
wrangling
queen
Whom
everything
becomes
to
chide
to
laugh
To
weep
whose
every
passion
fully
strives
To
make
itself
in
thee
fair
and
admird
No
messenger
but
thine
and
all
alone
Tonight
well
wander
through
the
streets
and
note
The
qualities
of
people
Come
my
queen
Last
night
you
did
desire
it
Speak
not
to
us
Is
Caesar
with
Antonius
prizd
so
slight
Sir
sometimes
when
he
is
not
Antony
He
comes
too
short
of
that
great
property
Which
still
should
go
with
Antony
I
am
full
sorry
That
he
approves
the
common
liar
who
Thus
speaks
of
him
at
Rome
but
I
will
hope
Of
better
deeds
tomorrow
Rest
you
happy
Where
is
he
I
did
not
see
him
since
See
where
he
is
whos
with
him
what
he
does
I
did
not
send
you
If
you
find
him
sad
Say
I
am
dancing
if
in
mirth
report
That
I
am
sudden
sick
Quick
and
return
Madam
methinks
if
you
did
love
him
dearly
You
do
not
hold
the
method
to
enforce
The
like
from
him
What
should
I
do
I
do
not
In
each
thing
give
him
way
cross
him
in
nothing
Thou
teachest
like
a
fool
the
way
to
lose
him
Tempt
him
not
so
too
far
I
wish
forbear
In
time
we
hate
that
which
we
often
fear
Enter
But
here
comes
Antony
I
am
sick
and
sullen
I
am
sorry
to
give
breathing
to
my
purpose
Help
me
away
dear
Charmian
I
shall
fall
It
cannot
be
thus
long
the
sides
of
nature
Will
not
sustain
it
Now
my
dearest
queen
Pray
you
stand
farther
from
me
Whats
the
matter
I
know
by
that
same
eye
theres
some
good
news
What
says
the
married
woman
You
may
go
Would
she
had
never
given
you
leave
to
come
Let
her
not
say
tis
I
that
keep
you
here
I
have
no
power
upon
you
hers
you
are
The
gods
best
know
never
was
there
queen
So
mightily
betrayd
Yet
at
the
first
I
saw
the
treasons
planted
Cleopatra
Why
should
I
think
you
can
be
mine
and
true
Though
you
in
swearing
shake
the
throned
gods
Who
have
been
false
to
Fulvia
Riotous
madness
To
be
entangled
with
those
mouthmade
vows
Which
break
themselves
in
swearing
Most
sweet
queen
Nay
pray
you
seek
no
colour
for
your
going
But
bid
farewell
and
go
When
you
sued
staying
Then
was
the
time
for
words
No
going
then
Eternity
was
in
our
lips
and
eyes
Bliss
in
our
brows
bent
none
our
parts
so
poor
But
was
a
race
of
heaven
They
are
so
still
Or
thou
the
greatest
soldier
of
the
world
Art
turnd
the
greatest
liar
How
now
lady
I
would
I
had
thy
inches
Thou
shouldst
know
There
were
a
heart
in
Egypt
Hear
me
queen
The
strong
necessity
of
time
commands
Our
services
awhile
but
my
full
heart
Remains
in
use
with
you
Our
Italy
Shines
oer
with
civil
swords
Sextus
Pompeius
Makes
his
approaches
to
the
port
of
Rome
Equality
of
two
domestic
powers
Breed
scrupulous
faction
the
hated
grown
to
strength
Are
newly
grown
to
love
The
condemnd
Pompey
Rich
in
his
fathers
honour
creeps
apace
Into
the
hearts
of
such
as
have
not
thrived
Upon
the
present
state
whose
numbers
threaten
And
quietness
grown
sick
of
rest
would
purge
By
any
desperate
change
My
more
particular
And
that
which
most
with
you
should
safe
my
going
Is
Fulvias
death
Though
age
from
folly
could
not
give
me
freedom
It
does
from
childishness
Can
Fulvia
die
Shes
dead
my
Queen
Look
here
and
at
thy
sovereign
leisure
read
The
garboils
she
awakd
At
the
last
best
See
when
and
where
she
died
most
false
love
Where
be
the
sacred
vials
thou
shouldst
fill
With
sorrowful
water
Now
I
see
I
see
In
Fulvias
death
how
mine
receivd
shall
be
Quarrel
no
more
but
be
prepard
to
know
The
purposes
I
bear
which
are
or
cease
As
you
shall
give
th
advice
By
the
fire
That
quickens
Nilus
slime
I
go
from
hence
Thy
soldier
servant
making
peace
or
war
As
thou
affects
Cut
my
lace
Charmian
come
But
let
it
be
I
am
quickly
ill
and
well
So
Antony
loves
My
precious
queen
forbear
And
give
true
evidence
to
his
love
which
stands
An
honourable
trial
So
Fulvia
told
me
I
prithee
turn
aside
and
weep
for
her
Then
bid
adieu
to
me
and
say
the
tears
Belong
to
Egypt
Good
now
play
one
scene
Of
excellent
dissembling
and
let
it
look
Like
perfect
honour
Youll
heat
my
blood
no
more
You
can
do
better
yet
but
this
is
meetly
Now
by
my
sword
And
target
Still
he
mends
But
this
is
not
the
best
Look
prithee
Charmian
How
this
Herculean
Roman
does
become
The
carriage
of
his
chafe
Ill
leave
you
lady
Courteous
lord
one
word
Sir
you
and
I
must
part
but
thats
not
it
Sir
you
and
I
have
lovd
but
theres
not
it
That
you
know
well
Something
it
is
I
would
my
oblivion
is
a
very
Antony
And
I
am
all
forgotten
But
that
your
royalty
Holds
idleness
your
subject
I
should
take
you
For
idleness
itself
Tis
sweating
labour
To
bear
such
idleness
so
near
the
heart
As
Cleopatra
this
But
sir
forgive
me
Since
my
becomings
kill
me
when
they
do
not
Eye
well
to
you
Your
honour
calls
you
hence
Therefore
be
deaf
to
my
unpitied
folly
And
all
the
gods
go
with
you
Upon
your
sword
Sit
laurel
victory
and
smooth
success
Be
strewd
before
your
feet
Let
us
go
Come
Our
separation
so
abides
and
flies
That
thou
residing
here
goes
yet
with
me
And
I
hence
fleeting
here
remain
with
thee
Away
Charmian
Madam
Ha
ha
Give
me
to
drink
mandragora
Why
madam
That
I
might
sleep
out
this
great
gap
of
time
My
Antony
is
away
You
think
of
him
too
much
tis
treason
Madam
I
trust
not
so
Thou
eunuch
Mardian
Whats
your
Highness
pleasure
Not
now
to
hear
thee
sing
I
take
no
pleasure
In
aught
an
eunuch
has
Tis
well
for
thee
That
being
unseminard
thy
freer
thoughts
May
not
fly
forth
of
Egypt
Hast
thou
affections
Yes
gracious
madam
Indeed
Not
in
deed
madam
for
I
can
do
nothing
But
what
indeed
is
honest
to
be
done
Yet
have
I
fierce
affections
and
think
What
Venus
did
with
Mars
Charmian
Where
thinkst
thou
he
is
now
Stands
he
or
sits
he
Or
does
he
walk
or
is
he
on
his
horse
happy
horse
to
bear
the
weight
of
Antony
Do
bravely
horse
for
wotst
thou
whom
thou
movst
The
demiAtlas
of
this
earth
the
arm
And
burgonet
of
men
Hes
speaking
now
Or
murmuring
Wheres
my
serpent
of
old
Nile
For
so
he
calls
me
Now
I
feed
myself
With
most
delicious
poison
Think
on
me
That
am
with
Phoebus
amorous
pinches
black
And
wrinkled
deep
in
time
Broadfronted
Caesar
When
thou
wast
here
above
the
ground
I
was
morsel
for
a
monarch
and
great
Pompey
Would
stand
and
make
his
eyes
grow
in
my
brow
There
would
he
anchor
his
aspect
and
die
With
looking
on
his
life
Enter
Sovereign
of
Egypt
hail
How
much
unlike
art
thou
Mark
Antony
Yet
coming
from
him
that
great
medcine
hath
With
his
tinct
gilded
thee
How
goes
it
with
my
brave
Mark
Antony
Last
thing
he
did
dear
Queen
He
kissd
the
last
of
many
doubled
kisses
This
orient
pearl
His
speech
sticks
in
my
heart
Mine
ear
must
pluck
it
thence
Good
friend
quoth
he
Say
the
firm
Roman
to
great
Egypt
sends
This
treasure
of
an
oyster
at
whose
foot
To
mend
the
petty
present
I
will
piece
Her
opulent
throne
with
kingdoms
All
the
East
Say
thou
shall
call
her
mistress
So
he
nodded
And
soberly
did
mount
an
armgaunt
steed
Who
neighd
so
high
that
what
I
would
have
spoke
Was
beastly
dumbd
by
him
What
was
he
sad
or
merry
Like
to
the
time
o
th
year
between
the
extremes
Of
hot
and
cold
he
was
nor
sad
nor
merry
welldivided
disposition
Note
him
Note
him
good
Charmian
tis
the
man
but
note
him
He
was
not
sad
for
he
would
shine
on
those
That
make
their
looks
by
his
he
was
not
merry
Which
seemd
to
tell
them
his
remembrance
lay
In
Egypt
with
his
joy
but
between
both
heavenly
mingle
Best
thou
sad
or
merry
The
violence
of
either
thee
becomes
So
does
it
no
man
else
Metst
thou
my
posts
Ay
madam
twenty
several
messengers
Why
do
you
send
so
thick
Whos
born
that
day
When
I
forget
to
send
to
Antony
Shall
die
a
beggar
Ink
and
paper
Charmian
Welcome
my
good
Alexas
Did
I
Charmian
Ever
love
Caesar
so
that
brave
Caesar
Be
chokd
with
such
another
emphasis
Say
the
brave
Antony
The
valiant
Caesar
By
Isis
I
will
give
thee
bloody
teeth
If
thou
with
Caesar
paragon
again
My
man
of
men
By
your
most
gracious
pardon
I
sing
but
after
you
My
salad
days
When
I
was
green
in
judgment
cold
in
blood
To
say
as
I
said
then
But
come
away
Get
me
ink
and
paper
He
shall
have
every
day
a
several
greeting
Or
Ill
unpeople
Egypt
I
Messina
house
Enter
and
in
warlike
manner
If
the
great
gods
be
just
they
shall
assist
The
deeds
of
justest
men
Know
worthy
Pompey
That
what
they
do
delay
they
not
deny
Whiles
we
are
suitors
to
their
throne
decays
The
thing
we
sue
for
We
ignorant
of
ourselves
Beg
often
our
own
harms
which
the
wise
powrs
Deny
us
for
our
good
so
find
we
profit
By
losing
of
our
prayers
I
shall
do
well
The
people
love
me
and
the
sea
is
mine
My
powers
are
crescent
and
my
auguring
hope
Says
it
will
come
to
th
full
Mark
Antony
In
Egypt
sits
at
dinner
and
will
make
No
wars
without
doors
Caesar
gets
money
where
He
loses
hearts
Lepidus
flatters
both
Of
both
is
flatterd
but
he
neither
loves
Nor
either
cares
for
him
Caesar
and
Lepidus
Are
in
the
field
mighty
strength
they
carry
Where
have
you
this
Tis
false
From
Silvius
sir
He
dreams
I
know
they
are
in
Rome
together
Looking
for
Antony
But
all
the
charms
of
love
Salt
Cleopatra
soften
thy
wand
lip
Let
witchcraft
join
with
beauty
lust
with
both
Tie
up
the
libertine
in
a
field
of
feasts
Keep
his
brain
fuming
Epicurean
cooks
Sharpen
with
cloyless
sauce
his
appetite
That
sleep
and
feeding
may
prorogue
his
honour
Even
till
a
Lethed
dullness
Enter
How
now
Varrius
This
is
most
certain
that
I
shall
deliver
Mark
Antony
is
every
hour
in
Rome
Expected
Since
he
went
from
Egypt
tis
space
for
farther
travel
I
could
have
given
less
matter
better
ear
Menas
I
did
not
think
This
amorous
surfeiter
would
have
donnd
his
helm
For
such
a
petty
war
his
soldiership
Is
twice
the
other
twain
But
let
us
rear
The
higher
our
opinion
that
our
stirring
Can
from
the
lap
of
Egypts
widow
pluck
The
neerlustwearied
Antony
I
cannot
hope
Caesar
and
Antony
shall
well
greet
together
His
wife
thats
dead
did
trespasses
to
Caesar
His
brother
warrd
upon
him
although
I
think
Not
movd
by
Antony
I
know
not
Menas
How
lesser
enmities
may
give
way
to
greater
Weret
not
that
we
stand
up
against
them
all
Twere
pregnant
they
should
square
between
themselves
For
they
have
entertained
cause
enough
To
draw
their
swords
But
how
the
fear
of
us
May
cement
their
divisions
and
bind
up
The
petty
difference
we
yet
not
know
Bet
as
our
gods
will
havet
It
only
stands
Our
lives
upon
to
use
our
strongest
hands
Come
Menas
The
world
and
my
great
office
will
sometimes
Divide
me
from
your
bosom
All
which
time
Before
the
gods
my
knee
shall
bow
my
prayers
To
them
for
you
Good
night
sir
My
Octavia
Read
not
my
blemishes
in
the
worlds
report
I
have
not
kept
my
square
but
that
to
come
Shall
all
be
done
by
th
rule
Good
night
dear
lady
Good
night
sir
Good
night
Enter
Now
sirrah
you
do
wish
yourself
in
Egypt
Would
I
had
never
come
from
thence
nor
you
thither
If
you
can
your
reason
I
see
it
in
my
motion
have
it
not
in
my
tongue
but
yet
hie
you
to
Egypt
again
Say
to
me
Whose
fortunes
shall
rise
higher
Caesars
or
mine
Caesars
Therefore
Antony
stay
not
by
his
side
Thy
daemon
that
thy
spirit
which
keeps
thee
is
Noble
courageous
high
unmatchable
Where
Caesars
is
not
but
near
him
thy
angel
Becomes
a
fear
as
being
oerpowrd
Therefore
Make
space
enough
between
you
Speak
this
no
more
To
none
but
thee
no
more
but
when
to
thee
If
thou
dost
play
with
him
at
any
game
Thou
art
sure
to
lose
and
of
that
natural
luck
He
beats
thee
gainst
the
odds
Thy
lustre
thickens
When
he
shines
by
I
say
again
thy
spirit
Is
all
afraid
to
govern
thee
near
him
But
he
away
tis
noble
Get
thee
gone
Say
to
Ventidius
I
would
speak
with
him
He
shall
to
Parthia
Be
it
art
or
hap
He
hath
spoken
true
The
very
dice
obey
him
And
in
our
sports
my
better
cunning
faints
Under
his
chance
If
we
draw
lots
he
speeds
His
cocks
do
win
the
battle
still
of
mine
When
it
is
all
to
nought
and
his
quails
ever
Beat
mine
inhoopd
at
odds
I
will
to
Egypt
And
though
I
make
this
marriage
for
my
peace
I
th
East
my
pleasure
lies
Enter

Ventidius
You
must

Parthia

commissions

Follow

Give

Of

The
actor
may
plead
pardon
Ill

Give
me
mine
angle
well
to
th
river
There
My
music
playing
far
off
I
will
betray
Tawnyfinnd
fishes
my
bended
hook
shall
pierce
Their
slimy
jaws
and
as
I
draw
them
up
Ill
think
them
every
one
an
Antony
And
say
Ah
ha
Yare
caught
Twas
merry
when
You
wagerd
on
your
angling
when
your
diver
Did
hang
a
salt
fish
on
his
hook
which
he
With
fervency
drew
up
That
time
times
I
laughed
him
out
of
patience
and
that
night
I
laughd
him
into
patience
and
next
morn
Ere
the
ninth
hour
I
drunk
him
to
his
bed
Then
put
my
tires
and
mantles
on
him
whilst
I
wore
his
sword
Philippan
Enter
a
from
Italy
Ram

fruitful

in
mine
ears
That
long
time

been
barren
Madam

villain
Thou

thy
mistress
but

free
If

bluest
veins

Have
lippd

First

Bring

The

and
pour
Down
thy
illuttering
throat
Good
madam

Well

I
will
But
theres
no
goodness
in
thy
face
If
Antony
Be
free
and
healthful
why

tart

favour
To
trumpet
such
good
tidings
If
not
well
Thou

come
like
a
Fury
crownd
with
snakes
Not
like
a
formal
man
Willt
please
you
hear

I
have
a
mind
to
strike
thee
ere
thou
speakst
Yet
if
thou
say
Antony

well
Or
friends
with
Caesar
or
not
captive
to
him
Ill
set
thee
in
a
shower
of
gold
and
hail
Rich
pearls
upon

Madam

And

friends

Make

a
fortune
from
me
But

madam
I
do
not
like
but
yet
It
does
allay
The
good
precedence

upon
but

But
yet
is
as
a
gaoler
to
bring
forth
Some
monstrous
malefactor
Prithee
friend
Pour
out
the
pack
of
matter
to
mine
ear
The
good
and
bad

Free

For

turn
For

best

Charmian
Madam

The
most
infectious
pestilence
upon
thee
Strikes

Good

Hence
Strikes

Horrible
villain
or
Ill

Like

She

and

Thou

whippd
with
wire
and
stewd
in
brine
Smarting
in
lingring
pickle
Gracious
madam
I
that
do

news

match
Say

not
so
a
province
I
will
give
thee
And
make
thy
fortunes
proud
The
blow
thou
hadst
Shall

thy
peace
for

to
rage
And
I
will
boot
thee
with
what
gift

Thy
modesty

Hes

Rogue

livd
too
long
Draws
a
knife
Nay
then
Ill
run
What
mean
you
madam
I
have
made
no
fault
Good
madam
keep
yourself
within
yourself
The
man
is
innocent
Some
innocents
scape
not
the
thunderbolt
Melt
Egypt
into
Nile
and
kindly
creatures
Turn
all
to
serpents
Call
the
slave
again
Though
I
am
mad
I
will
not
bite
him
Call
He
is
afeard
to
come
I
will
not
hurt
him
These
hands
do
lack
nobility
that
they
strike
meaner
than
myself
since
I
myself
Have
given
myself
the
cause
Enter
the
again
Come
hither
sir
Though
it
be
honest
it
is
never
good
To
bring
bad
news
Give
to
a
gracious
message
An
host
of
tongues
but
let
ill
tidings
tell
Themselves
when
they
be
felt
I
have
done
my
duty
Is
he
married
I
cannot
hate
thee
worser
than
I
do
If
thou
again
say
Yes
Hes
married
madam
The
gods
confound
thee
Dost
thou
hold
there
still
Should
I
lie
madam
I
would
thou
didst
So
half
my
Egypt
were
submergd
and
made
cistern
for
scald
snakes
Go
get
thee
hence
Hadst
thou
Narcissus
in
thy
face
to
me
Thou
wouldst
appear
most
ugly
He
is
married
I
crave
your
Highness
pardon
He
is
married
Take
no
offence
that
I
would
not
offend
you
To
punish
me
for
what
you
make
me
do
Seems
much
unequal
Hes
married
to
Octavia
that
his
fault
should
make
a
knave
of
thee
That
art
not
what
thart
sure
of
Get
thee
hence
The
merchandise
which
thou
hast
brought
from
Rome
Are
all
too
dear
for
me
Lie
they
upon
thy
hand
And
be
undone
by
em
Good
your
Highness
patience
In
praising
Antony
I
have
dispraisd
Caesar
Many
times
madam
I
am
paid
fort
now
Lead
me
from
hence
I
faint
Iras
Charmian
Tis
no
matter
Go
to
the
fellow
good
Alexas
bid
him
Report
the
feature
of
Octavia
her
years
Her
inclination
let
him
not
leave
out
The
colour
of
her
hair
Bring
me
word
quickly
Let
him
for
ever
go
let
him
not
Charmian
Though
he
be
painted
one
way
like
a
Gorgon
The
other
ways
a
Mars
To
Bid
you
Alexas
Bring
me
word
how
tall
she
is
Pity
me
Charmian
But
do
not
speak
to
me
Lead
me
to
my
chamber
house
court
and
the
Forest
of
Arden
I
I
Orchard
of
house
Enter
and
As
I
remember
Adam
it
was
upon
this
fashion
bequeathed
me
by
will
but
poor
a
thousand
crowns
and
as
thou
sayst
charged
my
brother
on
his
blessing
to
breed
me
well
and
there
begins
my
sadness
My
brother
Jaques
he
keeps
at
school
and
report
speaks
goldenly
of
his
profit
For
my
part
he
keeps
me
rustically
at
home
or
to
speak
more
properly
stays
me
here
at
home
unkept
for
call
you
that
keeping
for
a
gentleman
of
my
birth
that
differs
not
from
the
stalling
of
an
ox
His
horses
are
bred
better
for
besides
that
they
are
fair
with
their
feeding
they
are
taught
their
manage
and
to
that
end
riders
dearly
hird
but
I
his
brother
gain
nothing
under
him
but
growth
for
the
which
his
animals
on
his
dunghills
are
as
much
bound
to
him
as
I
Besides
this
nothing
that
he
so
plentifully
gives
me
the
something
that
nature
gave
me
his
countenance
seems
to
take
from
me
He
lets
me
feed
with
his
hinds
bars
me
the
place
of
a
brother
and
as
much
as
in
him
lies
mines
my
gentility
with
my
education
This
is
it
Adam
that
grieves
me
and
the
spirit
of
my
father
which
I
think
is
within
me
begins
to
mutiny
against
this
servitude
I
will
no
longer
endure
it
though
yet
I
know
no
wise
remedy
how
to
avoid
it
Enter
Yonder
comes
my
master
your
brother
Go
apart
Adam
and
thou
shalt
hear
how
he
will
shake
me
up
retires
Now
sir
what
make
you
here
Nothing
I
am
not
taught
to
make
any
thing
What
mar
you
then
sir
Marry
sir
I
am
helping
you
to
mar
that
which
God
made
a
poor
unworthy
brother
of
yours
with
idleness
Marry
sir
be
better
employed
and
be
nought
awhile
Shall
I
keep
your
hogs
and
eat
husks
with
them
What
prodigal
portion
have
I
spent
that
I
should
come
to
such
penury
Know
you
where
you
are
sir
sir
very
well
here
in
your
orchard
Know
you
before
whom
sir
Ay
better
than
him
I
am
before
knows
me
I
know
you
are
my
eldest
brother
and
in
the
gentle
condition
of
blood
you
should
so
know
me
The
courtesy
of
nations
allows
you
my
better
in
that
you
are
the
firstborn
but
the
same
tradition
takes
not
away
my
blood
were
there
twenty
brothers
betwixt
us
I
have
as
much
of
my
father
in
me
as
you
albeit
I
confess
your
coming
before
me
is
nearer
to
his
reverence
What
boy
Strikes
him
Come
come
elder
brother
you
are
too
young
in
this
Wilt
thou
lay
hands
on
me
villain
I
am
no
villain
I
am
the
youngest
son
of
Sir
Rowland
de
Boys
He
was
my
father
and
he
is
thrice
a
villain
that
says
such
a
father
begot
villains
Wert
thou
not
my
brother
I
would
not
take
this
hand
from
thy
throat
till
this
other
had
pulld
out
thy
tongue
for
saying
so
Thou
has
raild
on
thyself
Coming
forward
Sweet
masters
be
patient
for
your
fathers
remembrance
be
at
accord
Let
me
go
I
say
I
will
not
till
I
please
you
shall
hear
me
My
father
chargd
you
in
his
will
to
give
me
good
education
you
have
traind
me
like
a
peasant
obscuring
and
hiding
from
me
all
gentlemanlike
qualities
The
spirit
of
my
father
grows
strong
in
me
and
I
will
no
longer
endure
it
therefore
allow
me
such
exercises
as
may
become
a
gentleman
or
give
me
the
poor
allottery
my
father
left
me
by
testament
with
that
I
will
go
buy
my
fortunes
And
what
wilt
thou
do
Beg
when
that
is
spent
Well
sir
get
you
in
I
will
not
long
be
troubled
with
you
you
shall
have
some
part
of
your
will
I
pray
you
leave
me
I
no
further
offend
you
than
becomes
me
for
my
good
Get
you
with
him
you
old
dog
Is
old
dog
my
reward
Most
true
I
have
lost
my
teeth
in
your
service
God
be
with
my
old
master
He
would
not
have
spoke
such
a
word
Is
it
even
so
Begin
you
to
grow
upon
me
I
will
physic
your
rankness
and
yet
give
no
thousand
crowns
neither
Holla
Dennis
Enter
Calls
your
worship
not
Charles
the
Dukes
wrestler
here
to
speak
with
me
So
please
you
he
is
here
at
the
door
and
importunes
access
to
you
Call
him
in
tomorrow
the
wrestling
is
Enter
Good
morrow
to
your
worship
Good
Monsieur
Charles
Whats
the
new
news
at
the
new
court
Theres
no
news
at
the
court
sir
but
the
old
news
that
is
the
old
Duke
is
banished
by
his
younger
brother
the
new
Duke
and
three
or
four
loving
lords
have
put
themselves
into
voluntary
exile
with
him
whose
lands
and
revenues
enrich
the
new
Duke
therefore
he
gives
them
good
leave
to
wander
Can
you
tell
if
Rosalind
the
Dukes
daughter
be
banished
with
her
father
no
for
the
Dukes
daughter
her
cousin
so
loves
her
being
ever
from
their
cradles
bred
together
that
she
would
have
followed
her
exile
or
have
died
to
stay
behind
her
She
is
at
the
court
and
no
less
beloved
of
her
uncle
than
his
own
daughter
and
never
two
ladies
loved
as
they
do
Where
will
the
old
Duke
live
They
say
he
is
already
in
the
Forest
of
Arden
and
a
many
merry
men
with
him
and
there
they
live
like
the
old
Robin
Hood
of
England
They
say
many
young
gentlemen
flock
to
him
every
day
and
fleet
the
time
carelessly
as
they
did
in
the
golden
world
What
you
wrestle
tomorrow
before
the
new
Duke
Marry
do
I
sir
and
I
came
to
acquaint
you
with
a
matter
I
am
given
sir
secretly
to
understand
that
your
younger
brother
Orlando
hath
a
disposition
to
come
in
disguisd
against
me
to
try
a
fall
Tomorrow
sir
I
wrestle
for
my
credit
and
he
that
escapes
me
without
some
broken
limb
shall
acquit
him
well
Your
brother
is
but
young
and
tender
and
for
your
love
I
would
be
loath
to
foil
him
as
I
must
for
my
own
honour
if
he
come
in
therefore
out
of
my
love
to
you
I
came
hither
to
acquaint
you
withal
that
either
you
might
stay
him
from
his
intendment
or
brook
such
disgrace
well
as
he
shall
run
into
in
that
it
is
thing
of
his
own
search
and
altogether
against
my
will
Charles
I
thank
thee
for
thy
love
to
me
which
thou
shalt
find
I
will
most
kindly
requite
I
had
myself
notice
of
my
brothers
purpose
herein
and
have
by
underhand
means
laboured
to
dissuade
him
from
it
but
he
is
resolute
Ill
tell
thee
Charles
it
is
the
stubbornest
young
fellow
of
France
full
of
ambition
an
envious
emulator
of
every
mans
good
parts
a
secret
and
villainous
contriver
against
me
his
natural
brother
Therefore
use
thy
discretion
I
had
as
lief
thou
didst
break
his
neck
as
his
finger
And
thou
wert
best
look
tot
for
if
thou
dost
him
any
slight
disgrace
or
if
he
do
not
mightily
grace
himself
on
thee
he
will
practise
against
thee
by
poison
entrap
thee
by
some
treacherous
device
and
never
leave
thee
till
he
hath
taen
thy
life
by
some
indirect
means
or
other
for
I
assure
thee
and
almost
with
tears
I
speak
it
there
is
not
one
so
young
and
so
villainous
this
day
living
I
speak
but
brotherly
of
him
but
should
I
anatomize
him
to
thee
as
he
is
I
must
blush
and
weep
and
thou
must
look
pale
and
wonder
I
am
heartily
glad
I
came
hither
to
you
If
he
come
tomorrow
Ill
give
him
his
payment
If
ever
he
go
alone
again
Ill
never
wrestle
for
prize
more
And
so
God
keep
your
worship
Farewell
good
Charles
Now
will
I
stir
this
gamester
I
hope
I
shall
see
an
end
of
him
for
my
soul
yet
I
know
not
why
hates
nothing
more
than
he
Yet
hes
gentle
never
schoold
and
yet
learned
full
of
noble
device
of
all
sorts
enchantingly
beloved
and
indeed
so
much
in
the
heart
of
the
world
and
especially
of
my
own
people
who
best
know
him
that
I
am
altogether
misprised
But
it
shall
not
be
so
long
this
wrestler
shall
clear
all
Nothing
remains
but
that
I
kindle
the
boy
thither
which
now
Ill
go
about
Why
cousin
why
Rosalind
Cupid
have
mercy
Not
a
word
Not
one
to
throw
at
a
dog
No
thy
words
are
too
precious
to
be
cast
away
upon
curs
throw
some
of
them
at
me
come
lame
me
with
reasons
Then
there
were
two
cousins
laid
up
when
the
one
should
be
lamd
with
reasons
and
the
other
mad
without
any
But
is
all
this
for
your
father
No
some
of
it
is
for
my
childs
father
how
full
of
briers
is
this
workingday
world
They
are
but
burs
cousin
thrown
upon
thee
in
holiday
foolery
if
we
walk
not
in
the
trodden
paths
our
very
petticoats
will
catch
them
I
could
shake
them
off
my
coat
these
burs
are
in
my
heart
Hem
them
away
I
would
try
if
I
could
cry
hem
and
have
him
Come
come
wrestle
with
thy
affections
they
take
the
part
of
a
better
wrestler
than
myself
a
good
wish
upon
you
You
will
try
in
time
in
despite
of
a
fall
But
turning
these
jests
out
of
service
let
us
talk
in
good
earnest
Is
it
possible
on
such
a
sudden
you
should
fall
into
so
strong
a
liking
with
old
Sir
Rowlands
youngest
son
The
Duke
my
father
lovd
his
father
dearly
Doth
it
therefore
ensue
that
you
should
love
his
son
dearly
By
this
kind
of
chase
I
should
hate
him
for
my
father
hated
his
father
dearly
yet
I
hate
not
Orlando
No
faith
hate
him
not
for
my
sake
Why
should
I
not
Doth
he
not
deserve
well
Enter
with
Let
me
love
him
for
that
and
do
you
love
him
because
I
do
Look
here
comes
the
Duke
With
his
eyes
full
of
anger
Mistress
dispatch
you
with
your
safest
haste
And
get
you
from
our
court
Me
uncle
You
cousin
Within
these
ten
days
if
that
thou
beest
found
So
near
our
public
court
as
twenty
miles
Thou
diest
for
it
I
do
beseech
your
Grace
Let
me
the
knowledge
of
my
fault
bear
with
me
If
with
myself
I
hold
intelligence
Or
have
acquaintance
with
mine
own
desires
If
that
I
do
not
dream
or
be
not
frantic
As
I
do
trust
I
am
not
then
dear
uncle
Never
so
much
as
in
a
thought
unborn
Did
I
offend
your
Highness
Thus
do
all
traitors
If
their
purgation
did
consist
in
words
They
are
as
innocent
as
grace
itself
Let
it
suffice
thee
that
I
trust
thee
not
Yet
your
mistrust
cannot
make
me
a
traitor
Tell
me
whereon
the
likelihood
depends
Thou
art
thy
fathers
daughter
theres
enough
was
I
when
your
Highness
took
his
dukedom
So
was
I
when
your
Highness
banishd
him
Treason
is
not
inherited
my
lord
Or
if
we
did
derive
it
from
our
friends
Whats
that
to
me
My
father
was
no
traitor
Then
good
my
liege
mistake
me
not
so
much
To
think
my
poverty
is
treacherous
Dear
sovereign
hear
me
speak
Ay
Celia
we
stayd
her
for
your
sake
Else
had
she
with
her
father
rangd
along
I
did
not
then
entreat
to
have
her
stay
It
was
your
pleasure
and
your
own
remorse
I
was
too
young
that
time
to
value
her
But
now
I
know
her
If
she
be
a
traitor
Why
so
am
I
we
still
have
slept
together
Rose
at
an
instant
learnd
playd
eat
together
And
wheresoeer
we
went
like
Junos
swans
Still
we
went
coupled
and
inseparable
She
is
too
subtle
for
thee
and
her
smoothness
Her
very
silence
and
her
patience
Speak
to
the
people
and
they
pity
her
Thou
art
a
fool
She
robs
thee
of
thy
name
And
thou
wilt
show
more
bright
and
seem
more
virtuous
When
she
is
gone
Then
open
not
thy
lips
Firm
and
irrevocable
is
my
doom
Which
I
have
passd
upon
her
she
is
banishd
Pronounce
that
sentence
then
on
me
my
liege
I
cannot
live
out
of
her
company
You
are
a
fool
You
niece
provide
yourself
If
you
outstay
the
time
upon
mine
honour
And
in
the
greatness
of
my
word
you
die
my
poor
Rosalind
Whither
wilt
thou
go
Wilt
thou
change
fathers
I
will
give
thee
mine
I
charge
thee
be
not
thou
more
grievd
than
I
am
I
have
more
cause
Thou
hast
not
cousin
Prithee
be
cheerful
Knowst
thou
not
the
Duke
Hath
banishd
me
his
daughter
That
he
hath
not
No
hath
not
Rosalind
lacks
then
the
love
Which
teacheth
thee
that
thou
and
I
am
one
Shall
we
be
sundred
Shall
we
part
sweet
girl
No
let
my
father
seek
another
heir
Therefore
devise
with
me
how
we
may
fly
Whither
to
go
and
what
to
bear
with
us
And
do
not
seek
to
take
your
charge
upon
you
To
bear
your
griefs
yourself
and
leave
me
out
For
by
this
heaven
now
at
our
sorrows
pale
Say
what
thou
canst
Ill
go
along
with
thee
Why
whither
shall
we
go
To
seek
my
uncle
in
the
Forest
of
Arden
Alas
what
danger
will
it
be
to
us
Maids
as
we
are
to
travel
forth
so
far
Beauty
provoketh
thieves
sooner
than
gold
Ill
put
myself
in
poor
and
mean
attire
And
with
a
kind
of
umber
smirch
my
face
The
like
do
you
so
shall
we
pass
along
And
never
stir
assailants
Were
it
not
better
Because
that
I
am
more
than
common
tall
That
I
did
suit
me
all
points
like
a
man
gallant
curtleaxe
upon
my
thigh
boar
spear
in
my
hand
and
in
my
heart
Lie
there
what
hidden
womans
fear
there
will
Well
have
a
swashing
and
a
martial
outside
As
many
other
mannish
cowards
have
That
do
outface
it
with
their
semblances
What
shall
I
call
thee
when
thou
art
a
man
Ill
have
no
worse
a
name
than
Joves
own
page
And
therefore
look
you
call
me
Ganymede
But
what
will
you
be
calld
Something
that
hath
a
reference
to
my
state
No
longer
Celia
but
Aliena
But
cousin
what
if
we
assayd
to
steal
The
clownish
fool
out
of
your
fathers
court
Would
he
not
be
a
comfort
to
our
travel
Hell
go
along
oer
the
wide
world
with
me
Leave
me
alone
to
woo
him
Lets
away
And
get
our
jewels
and
our
wealth
together
Devise
the
fittest
time
and
safest
way
To
hide
us
from
pursuit
that
will
be
made
After
my
flight
Now
go
we
in
content
To
liberty
and
not
to
banishment
I
The
Forest
of
Arden
Enter
and
two
or
three
like
foresters
Now
my
comates
and
brothers
in
exile
Hath
not
old
custom
made
this
life
more
sweet
Than
that
of
painted
pomp
Are
not
these
woods
More
free
from
peril
than
the
envious
court
Here
feel
we
not
the
penalty
of
Adam
The
seasons
difference
as
the
icy
fang
And
churlish
chiding
of
the
winters
wind
Which
when
it
bites
and
blows
upon
my
body
Even
till
I
shrink
with
cold
I
smile
and
say
This
is
no
flattery
these
are
counsellors
That
feelingly
persuade
me
what
I
am
Sweet
are
the
uses
of
adversity
Which
like
the
toad
ugly
and
venomous
Wears
yet
a
precious
jewel
in
his
head
And
this
our
life
exempt
from
public
haunt
Finds
tongues
in
trees
books
in
the
running
brooks
Sermons
in
stones
and
good
in
everything
I
would
not
change
it
Happy
is
your
Grace
That
can
translate
the
stubbornness
of
fortune
Into
so
quiet
and
so
sweet
a
style
Come
shall
we
go
and
kill
us
venison
And
yet
it
irks
me
the
poor
dappled
fools
Being
native
burghers
of
this
desert
city
Should
in
their
own
confines
with
forked
heads
Have
their
round
haunches
gord
Indeed
my
lord
The
melancholy
Jaques
grieves
at
that
And
in
that
kind
swears
you
do
more
usurp
Than
doth
your
brother
that
hath
banishd
you
Today
my
Lord
of
Amiens
and
myself
Did
steal
behind
him
as
he
lay
along
Under
an
oak
whose
antique
root
peeps
out
Upon
the
brook
that
brawls
along
this
wood
To
the
which
place
a
poor
sequestred
stag
That
from
the
hunters
aim
had
taen
a
hurt
Did
come
to
languish
and
indeed
my
lord
The
wretched
animal
heavd
forth
such
groans
That
their
discharge
did
stretch
his
leathern
coat
Almost
to
bursting
and
the
big
round
tears
Coursd
one
another
down
his
innocent
nose
In
piteous
chase
and
thus
the
hairy
fool
Much
marked
of
the
melancholy
Jaques
Stood
on
th
extremest
verge
of
the
swift
brook
Augmenting
it
with
tears
But
what
said
Jaques
Did
he
not
moralize
this
spectacle
yes
into
a
thousand
similes
First
for
his
weeping
into
the
needless
stream
Poor
deer
quoth
he
thou
makst
a
testament
As
worldlings
do
giving
thy
sum
of
more
To
that
which
had
too
much
Then
being
there
alone
Left
and
abandoned
of
his
velvet
friends
Tis
right
quoth
he
thus
misery
doth
part
The
flux
of
company
Anon
a
careless
herd
Full
of
the
pasture
jumps
along
by
him
And
never
stays
to
greet
him
Ay
quoth
Jaques
Sweep
on
you
fat
and
greasy
citizens
Tis
just
the
fashion
Wherefore
do
you
look
Upon
that
poor
and
broken
bankrupt
there
Thus
most
invectively
he
pierceth
through
The
body
of
the
country
city
court
Yea
and
of
this
our
life
swearing
that
we
Are
mere
usurpers
tyrants
and
whats
worse
To
fright
the
animals
and
to
kill
them
up
In
their
assignd
and
native
dwellingplace
And
did
you
leave
him
in
this
contemplation
We
did
my
lord
weeping
and
commenting
Upon
the
sobbing
deer
Show
me
the
place
I
love
to
cope
him
in
these
sullen
fits
For
then
hes
full
of
matter
Ill
bring
you
to
him
straight
Whos
there
What
my
young
master
my
gentle
master
my
sweet
master
you
memory
Of
old
Sir
Rowland
Why
what
make
you
here
Why
are
you
virtuous
Why
do
people
love
you
And
wherefore
are
you
gentle
strong
and
valiant
Why
would
you
be
so
fond
to
overcome
The
bonny
prizer
of
the
humorous
Duke
Your
praise
is
come
too
swiftly
home
before
you
Know
you
not
master
to
some
kind
of
men
Their
graces
serve
them
but
as
enemies
No
more
do
yours
Your
virtues
gentle
master
Are
sanctified
and
holy
traitors
to
you
what
a
world
is
this
when
what
is
comely
Envenoms
him
that
bears
it
Why
whats
the
matter
unhappy
youth
Come
not
within
these
doors
within
this
roof
The
enemy
of
all
your
graces
lives
Your
brother
no
no
brother
yet
the
son
Yet
not
the
son
I
will
not
call
him
son
Of
him
I
was
about
to
call
his
father
Hath
heard
your
praises
and
this
night
he
means
To
burn
the
lodging
where
you
use
to
lie
And
you
within
it
If
he
fail
of
that
He
will
have
other
means
to
cut
you
off
I
overheard
him
and
his
practices
This
is
no
place
this
house
is
but
a
butchery
Abhor
it
fear
it
do
not
enter
it
Why
whither
Adam
wouldst
thou
have
me
go
No
matter
whither
so
you
come
not
here
What
wouldst
thou
have
me
go
and
beg
my
food
Or
with
a
base
and
boistrous
sword
enforce
thievish
living
on
the
common
road
This
I
must
do
or
know
not
what
to
do
Yet
this
I
will
not
do
do
how
I
can
I
rather
will
subject
me
to
the
malice
Of
a
diverted
blood
and
bloody
brother
But
do
not
so
I
have
five
hundred
crowns
The
thrifty
hire
I
savd
under
your
father
Which
I
did
store
to
be
my
fosternurse
When
service
should
in
my
old
limbs
lie
lame
And
unregarded
age
in
corners
thrown
Take
that
and
He
that
doth
the
ravens
feed
Yea
providently
caters
for
the
sparrow
Be
comfort
to
my
age
Here
is
the
gold
All
this
I
give
you
Let
me
be
your
servant
Though
I
look
old
yet
I
am
strong
and
lusty
For
in
my
youth
I
never
did
apply
Hot
and
rebellious
liquors
in
my
blood
Nor
did
not
with
unbashful
forehead
woo
The
means
of
weakness
and
debility
Therefore
my
age
is
as
a
lusty
winter
Frosty
but
kindly
Let
me
go
with
you
Ill
do
the
service
of
a
younger
man
In
all
your
business
and
necessities
good
old
man
how
well
in
thee
appears
The
constant
service
of
the
antique
world
When
service
sweat
for
duty
not
for
meed
Thou
art
not
for
the
fashion
of
these
times
Where
none
will
sweat
but
for
promotion
And
having
that
do
choke
their
service
up
Even
with
the
having
it
is
not
so
with
thee
But
poor
old
man
thou
prunst
a
rotten
tree
That
cannot
so
much
as
a
blossom
yield
In
lieu
of
all
thy
pains
and
husbandry
But
come
thy
ways
well
go
along
together
And
ere
we
have
thy
youthful
wages
spent
Well
light
upon
some
settled
low
content
Master
go
on
and
I
will
follow
the
To
the
last
gasp
with
truth
and
loyalty
From
seventeen
years
till
now
almost
fourscore
Here
lived
I
but
now
live
here
no
more
At
seventeen
years
many
their
fortunes
seek
But
at
fourscore
it
is
too
late
a
week
Yet
fortune
cannot
recompense
me
better
Than
to
die
well
and
not
my
masters
debtor
Under
the
greenwood
tree
Who
loves
to
lie
with
me
And
turn
his
merry
note
Unto
the
sweet
birds
throat
Come
hither
come
hither
come
hither
Here
shall
he
see
No
enemy
But
winter
and
rough
weather
More
more
I
prithee
more
It
will
make
you
melancholy
Monsieur
Jaques
I
thank
it
More
I
prithee
more
I
can
suck
melancholy
out
of
a
song
as
a
weasel
sucks
eggs
More
I
prithee
more
My
voice
is
ragged
I
know
I
cannot
please
you
I
do
not
desire
you
to
please
me
I
do
desire
you
to
sing
Come
more
another
stanzo
Call
you
em
stanzos
What
you
will
Monsieur
Jaques
Nay
I
care
not
for
their
names
they
owe
me
nothing
Will
you
sing
More
at
your
request
than
to
please
myself
Well
then
if
ever
I
thank
any
man
Ill
thank
you
but
that
they
call
compliment
is
like
th
encounter
of
two
dogapes
and
when
a
man
thanks
me
heartily
methinks
have
given
him
a
penny
and
he
renders
me
the
beggarly
thanks
Come
sing
and
you
that
will
not
hold
your
tongues
Well
Ill
end
the
song
Sirs
cover
the
while
the
Duke
will
drink
under
this
tree
He
hath
been
all
this
day
to
look
you
And
I
have
been
all
this
day
to
avoid
him
He
is
to
disputable
for
my
company
I
think
of
as
many
matters
as
he
but
I
give
heaven
thanks
and
make
no
boast
of
them
Come
warble
come
All
together
here
Who
doth
ambition
shun
And
loves
to
live
i
th
sun
Seeking
the
food
he
eats
And
pleasd
with
what
he
gets
Come
hither
come
hither
come
hither
Here
shall
he
see
No
enemy
But
winter
and
rough
weather
Ill
give
you
a
verse
to
this
note
that
I
made
yesterday
in
despite
of
my
invention
And
Ill
sing
it
Thus
it
goes
If
it
do
come
to
pass
That
any
man
turn
ass
Leaving
his
wealth
and
ease
stubborn
will
to
please
Ducdame
ducdame
ducdame
Here
shall
he
see
Gross
fools
as
he
An
if
he
will
come
to
me
Whats
that
ducdame
Tis
a
Greek
invocation
to
call
fools
into
a
circle
Ill
go
sleep
if
I
can
if
I
cannot
Ill
rail
against
all
the
firstborn
of
Egypt
And
Ill
go
seek
the
Duke
his
banquet
is
prepard
table
set
out
Enter
and
like
outlaws
I
think
he
be
transformd
into
a
beast
For
I
can
nowhere
find
him
like
a
man
My
lord
he
is
but
even
now
gone
hence
Here
was
he
merry
hearing
of
a
song
If
he
compact
of
jars
grow
musical
We
shall
have
shortly
discord
in
the
spheres
Go
seek
him
tell
him
I
would
speak
with
him
Enter
He
saves
my
labour
by
his
own
approach
Why
how
now
monsieur
what
a
life
is
this
That
your
poor
friends
must
woo
your
company
What
you
look
merrily
fool
a
fool
I
met
a
fool
i
th
forest
motley
fool
miserable
world
As
I
do
live
by
food
I
met
a
fool
Who
laid
him
down
and
baskd
him
in
the
sun
And
raild
on
Lady
Fortune
in
good
terms
In
good
set
terms
and
yet
a
motley
fool
Good
morrow
fool
quoth
I
No
sir
quoth
he
Call
me
not
fool
till
heaven
hath
sent
me
fortune
And
then
he
drew
a
dial
from
his
poke
And
looking
on
it
with
lacklustre
eye
Says
very
wisely
It
is
ten
oclock
Thus
we
may
see
quoth
he
how
the
world
wags
Tis
but
an
hour
ago
since
it
was
nine
And
after
one
hour
more
twill
be
eleven
And
so
from
hour
to
hour
we
ripe
and
ripe
And
then
from
hour
to
hour
we
rot
and
rot
And
thereby
hangs
a
tale
When
I
did
hear
The
motley
fool
thus
moral
on
the
time
My
lungs
began
to
crow
like
chanticleer
That
fools
should
be
so
deep
contemplative
And
I
did
laugh
sans
intermission
An
hour
by
his
dial
noble
fool
worthy
fool
Motleys
the
only
wear
What
fool
is
this
worthy
fool
One
that
hath
been
a
courtier
And
says
if
ladies
be
but
young
and
fair
They
have
the
gift
to
know
it
and
in
his
brain
Which
is
as
dry
as
the
remainder
biscuit
After
a
voyage
he
hath
strange
places
crammd
With
observation
the
which
he
vents
In
mangled
forms
that
I
were
a
fool
I
am
ambitious
for
a
motley
coat
Thou
shalt
have
one
It
is
my
only
suit
Provided
that
you
weed
your
better
judgments
Of
all
opinion
that
grows
rank
in
them
That
I
am
wise
I
must
have
liberty
Withal
as
large
a
charter
as
the
wind
To
blow
on
whom
I
please
for
so
fools
have
And
they
that
are
most
galled
with
my
folly
They
most
must
laugh
And
why
sir
must
they
so
The
why
is
plain
as
way
to
parish
church
He
that
a
fool
doth
very
wisely
hit
Doth
very
foolishly
although
he
smart
Not
to
seem
senseless
of
the
bob
if
not
The
wise
mans
folly
is
anatomizd
Even
by
the
squandring
glances
of
the
fool
Invest
me
in
my
motley
give
me
leave
To
speak
my
mind
and
I
will
through
and
through
Cleanse
the
foul
body
of
th
infected
world
If
they
will
patiently
receive
my
medicine
Fie
on
thee
I
can
tell
what
thou
wouldst
do
What
for
a
counter
would
I
do
but
good
Most
Mischievous
foul
sin
in
chiding
sin
For
thou
thyself
hast
been
a
libertine
As
sensual
as
the
brutish
sting
itself
And
all
th
embossed
sores
and
headed
evils
That
thou
with
license
of
free
foot
hast
caught
Wouldst
thou
disgorge
into
the
general
world
Why
who
cries
out
on
pride
That
can
therein
tax
any
private
party
Doth
it
not
flow
as
hugely
as
the
sea
Till
that
the
wearers
very
means
do
ebb
What
woman
in
the
city
do
I
name
When
that
I
say
the
citywoman
bears
The
cost
of
princes
on
unworthy
shoulders
Who
can
come
in
and
say
that
I
mean
her
When
such
a
one
as
she
such
is
her
neighbour
Or
what
is
he
of
basest
function
That
says
his
bravery
is
not
on
my
cost
Thinking
that
I
mean
him
but
therein
suits
His
folly
to
the
mettle
of
my
speech
There
then
how
then
what
then
Let
me
see
wherein
My
tongue
hath
wrongd
him
if
it
do
him
right
Then
he
hath
wrongd
himself
if
he
be
free
Why
then
my
taxing
like
a
wildgoose
flies
Unclaimd
of
any
man
But
who
comes
here
Enter
with
his
sword
drawn
Forbear
and
eat
no
more
Why
I
have
eat
none
yet
Nor
shalt
not
till
necessity
be
servd
Of
what
kind
should
this
cock
come
of
Art
thou
thus
boldend
man
by
thy
distress
Or
else
a
rude
despiser
of
good
manners
That
in
civility
thou
seemst
so
empty
You
touchd
my
vein
at
first
the
thorny
point
Of
bare
distress
hath
taen
from
me
the
show
Of
smooth
civility
yet
arn
I
inland
bred
And
know
some
nurture
But
forbear
I
say
He
dies
that
touches
any
of
this
fruit
Till
I
and
my
affairs
are
answered
An
you
will
not
be
answerd
with
reason
I
must
die
What
would
you
have
Your
gentleness
shall
force
More
than
your
force
move
us
to
gentleness
I
almost
die
for
food
and
let
me
have
it
Sit
down
and
feed
and
welcome
to
our
table
Speak
you
so
gently
Pardon
me
I
pray
you
I
thought
that
all
things
had
been
savage
here
And
therefore
put
I
on
the
countenance
Of
stern
commandment
But
whateer
you
are
That
in
this
desert
inaccessible
Under
the
shade
of
melancholy
boughs
Lose
and
neglect
the
creeping
hours
of
time
If
ever
you
have
lookd
on
better
days
If
ever
been
where
bells
have
knolld
to
church
If
ever
sat
at
any
good
mans
feast
If
ever
from
your
eyelids
wipd
a
tear
And
know
what
tis
to
pity
and
be
pitied
Let
gentleness
my
strong
enforcement
be
In
the
which
hope
I
blush
and
hide
my
sword
True
is
it
that
we
have
seen
better
days
And
have
with
holy
bell
been
knolld
to
church
And
sat
at
good
mens
feasts
and
wipd
our
eyes
Of
drops
that
sacred
pity
hath
engendred
And
therefore
sit
you
down
in
gentleness
And
take
upon
command
what
help
we
have
That
to
your
wanting
may
be
ministred
Then
but
forbear
your
food
a
little
while
Whiles
like
a
doe
I
go
to
find
my
fawn
And
give
it
food
There
is
an
old
poor
man
Who
after
me
hath
many
a
weary
step
Limpd
in
pure
love
till
he
be
first
sufficd
Oppressd
with
two
weak
evils
age
and
hunger
I
will
not
touch
a
bit
Go
find
him
out
And
we
will
nothing
waste
till
you
return
I
thank
ye
and
be
blest
for
your
good
comfort
Thou
seest
we
are
not
all
alone
unhappy
This
wide
and
universal
theatre
Presents
more
woeful
pageants
than
the
scene
Wherein
we
play
in
All
the
worlds
a
stage
And
all
the
men
and
women
merely
players
They
have
their
exits
and
their
entrances
And
one
man
in
his
time
plays
many
parts
His
acts
being
seven
ages
At
first
the
infant
Mewling
and
puking
in
the
nurses
arms
Then
the
whining
schoolboy
with
his
satchel
And
shining
morning
face
creeping
like
snail
Unwillingly
to
school
And
then
the
lover
Sighing
like
furnace
with
a
woeful
ballad
Made
to
his
mistress
eyebrow
Then
a
soldier
Full
of
strange
oaths
and
bearded
like
the
pard
Jealous
in
honour
sudden
and
quick
in
quarrel
Seeking
the
bubble
reputation
Even
in
the
cannons
mouth
And
then
the
justice
In
fair
round
belly
with
good
capon
lind
With
eyes
severe
and
beard
of
formal
cut
Full
of
wise
saws
and
modern
instances
And
so
he
plays
his
part
The
sixth
age
shifts
Into
the
lean
and
slipperd
pantaloon
With
spectacles
on
nose
and
pouch
on
side
His
youthful
hose
well
savd
a
world
too
wide
For
his
shrunk
shank
and
his
big
manly
voice
Turning
again
toward
childish
treble
pipes
And
whistles
in
his
sound
Last
scene
of
all
That
ends
this
strange
eventful
history
Is
second
childishness
and
mere
oblivion
Sans
teeth
sans
eyes
sans
taste
sans
every
thing
Reenter
with
Welcome
Set
down
your
venerable
burden
And
let
him
feed
I
thank
you
most
for
him
So
had
you
need
I
scarce
can
speak
to
thank
you
for
myself
Welcome
fall
to
I
will
not
trouble
you
As
yet
to
question
you
about
your
fortunes
Give
us
some
music
and
good
cousin

Blow

winter
wind
Thou
art
not
so
unkind
As
mans
ingratitude
Thy
tooth
is
not
so
keen
Because
thou
art
not

Although
thy
breath
be
rude
Heighho

That

Though

Thy

Well
push
him
out

And
let
my

of
such
a
nature
Make
an
extent
upon
his

Do
this

Come
apace
good
Audrey
I
will
fetch
up
your
goats
Audrey
And
how
Audrey
am
I
the
man
yet
Doth
my
simple
feature
content
you
Your
features
Lord
warrant
us
What
features
I
am
here
with
thee
and
thy
goats
as
the
most
capricious
poet
honest
Ovid
was
among
the
Goths
Aside
knowledge
illinhabited
worse
than
Jove
in
a
thatchd
house
When
a
mans
verses
cannot
be
understood
nor
a
mans
good
wit
seconded
with
the
forward
child
understanding
it
strikes
a
man
more
dead
than
a
great
reckoning
in
a
little
room
Truly
I
would
the
gods
had
made
thee
poetical
I
do
not
know
what
poetical
is
Is
it
honest
in
deed
and
word
Is
it
a
true
thing
No
truly
for
the
truest
poetry
is
the
most
feigning
and
lovers
are
given
to
poetry
and
what
they
swear
in
poetry
may
be
said
as
lovers
they
do
feign
Do
you
wish
then
that
the
gods
had
made
me
poetical
I
do
truly
for
thou
swearst
to
me
thou
art
honest
now
if
thou
wert
a
poet
I
might
have
some
hope
thou
didst
feign
Would
you
not
have
me
honest
No
truly
unless
thou
wert
hardfavourd
for
honesty
coupled
to
beauty
is
to
have
honey
a
sauce
to
sugar
Aside
material
fool
Well
I
am
not
fair
and
therefore
I
pray
the
gods
make
me
honest
Truly
and
to
cast
away
honesty
upon
a
foul
slut
were
to
put
good
meat
into
an
unclean
dish
I
am
not
a
slut
though
I
thank
the
gods
I
am
foul
Well
praised
be
the
gods
for
thy
foulness
sluttishness
may
come
hereafter
But
be
it
as
it
may
be
I
will
marry
thee
and
to
that
end
I
have
been
with
Sir
Oliver
Martext
the
vicar
of
the
next
village
who
hath
promisd
to
meet
me
in
this
place
of
the
forest
and
to
couple
us
Aside
I
would
fain
see
this
meeting
Well
the
gods
give
us
joy
Amen
man
may
if
he
were
of
a
fearful
heart
stagger
in
this
attempt
for
here
we
have
no
temple
but
the
wood
no
assembly
but
hornbeasts
But
what
though
Courage
As
horns
are
odious
they
are
necessary
It
is
said
Many
a
man
knows
no
end
of
his
goods
Right
Many
a
man
has
good
horns
and
knows
no
end
of
them
Well
that
is
the
dowry
of
his
wife
tis
none
of
his
own
getting
Horns
Even
so
Poor
men
alone
No
no
the
noblest
deer
hath
them
as
huge
as
the
rascal
Is
the
single
man
therefore
blessed
No
as
a
walld
town
is
more
worthier
than
a
village
so
is
the
forehead
of
a
married
man
more
honourable
than
the
bare
brow
of
a
bachelor
and
by
how
much
defence
is
better
than
no
skill
by
so
much
is
horn
more
precious
than
to
want
Here
comes
Sir
Oliver
Enter
Sir
Oliver
Martext
you
are
well
met
Will
you
dispatch
us
here
under
this
tree
or
shall
we
go
with
you
to
your
chapel
Is
there
none
here
to
give
the
woman
I
will
not
take
her
on
gift
of
any
man
Truly
she
must
be
given
or
the
marriage
is
not
lawful
Discovering
himself
Proceed
proceed
Ill
give
her
Good
even
good
Master
Whatyecallt
how
do
you
sir
You
are
very
well
met
Goddild
you
for
your
last
company
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
Even
a
toy
in
hand
here
sir
Nay
pray
be
coverd
Will
you
be
married
motley
As
the
ox
hath
his
bow
sir
the
horse
his
curb
and
the
falcon
her
bells
so
man
hath
his
desires
and
as
pigeons
bill
so
wedlock
would
be
nibbling
And
will
you
being
a
man
of
your
breeding
be
married
under
a
bush
like
a
beggar
Get
you
to
church
and
have
a
good
priest
that
can
tell
you
what
marriage
is
this
fellow
will
but
join
you
together
as
they
join
wainscot
then
one
of
you
will
prove
a
shrunk
panel
and
like
green
timber
warp
warp
Aside
I
am
not
in
the
mind
but
I
were
better
to
be
married
of
him
than
of
another
for
he
is
not
like
to
marry
me
well
and
not
being
well
married
it
will
be
a
good
excuse
for
me
hereafter
to
leave
my
wife
Go
thou
with
me
and
let
me
counsel
thee
Come
sweet
Audrey
We
must
be
married
or
we
must
live
in
bawdry
Farewell
good
Master
Oliver
Not
sweet
Oliver
brave
Oliver
Leave
me
not
behind
thee
But
Wind
away
Begone
I
say
I
will
not
to
wedding
with
thee
Tis
no
matter
neer
a
fantastical
knave
of
them
all
shall
flout
me
out
of
my
calling
Sweet
Phebe
do
not
scorn
me
do
not
Phebe
Say
that
you
love
me
not
but
say
not
so
In
bitterness
The
common
executioner
Whose
heart
th
accustomd
sight
of
death
makes
hard
Falls
not
the
axe
upon
the
humbled
neck
But
first
begs
pardon
Will
you
sterner
be
Than
he
that
dies
and
lives
by
bloody
drops
Enter
and
at
a
distance
I
would
not
be
thy
executioner
I
fly
thee
for
I
would
not
injure
thee
Thou
tellst
me
there
is
murder
in
mine
eye
Tis
pretty
sure
and
very
probable
That
eyes
that
are
the
frailst
and
softest
things
Who
shut
their
coward
gates
on
atomies
Should
be
calld
tyrants
butchers
murderers
Now
I
do
frown
on
thee
with
all
my
heart
And
if
mine
eyes
can
wound
now
let
them
kill
thee
Now
counterfeit
to
swoon
why
now
fall
down
Or
if
thou
canst
not
for
shame
for
shame
Lie
not
to
say
mine
eyes
are
murderers
Now
show
the
wound
mine
eye
hath
made
in
thee
Scratch
thee
but
with
a
pin
and
there
remains
Some
scar
of
it
lean
upon
a
rush
The
cicatrice
and
capable
impressure
Thy
palm
some
moment
keeps
but
now
mine
eyes
Which
I
have
darted
at
thee
hurt
thee
not
Nor
I
am
sure
there
is
not
force
in
eyes
That
can
do
hurt
dear
Phebe
If
ever
as
that
ever
may
be
near
You
meet
in
some
fresh
cheek
the
power
of
fancy
Then
shall
you
know
the
wounds
invisible
That
loves
keen
arrows
make
But
till
that
time
Come
not
thou
near
me
and
when
that
time
comes
Afflict
me
with
thy
mocks
pity
me
not
As
till
that
time
I
shall
not
pity
thee
Advancing
And
why
I
pray
you
Who
might
be
your
mother
That
you
insult
exult
and
all
at
once
Over
the
wretched
What
though
you
have
no
beauty
As
by
my
faith
I
see
no
more
in
you
Than
without
candle
may
go
dark
to
bed
Must
you
be
therefore
proud
and
pitiless
Why
what
means
this
Why
do
you
look
on
me
I
see
no
more
in
you
than
in
the
ordinary
Of
natures
salework
Ods
my
little
life
I
think
she
means
to
tangle
my
eyes
too
No
faith
proud
mistress
hope
not
after
it
Tis
not
your
inky
brows
your
black
silk
hair
Your
bugle
eyeballs
nor
your
cheek
of
cream
That
can
entame
my
spirits
to
your
worship
You
foolish
shepherd
wherefore
do
you
follow
her
Like
foggy
south
puffing
with
wind
and
rain
You
are
a
thousand
times
a
properer
man
Than
she
a
woman
Tis
such
fools
as
you
That
makes
the
world
full
of
illfavourd
children
Tis
not
her
glass
but
you
that
flatters
her
And
out
of
you
she
sees
herself
more
proper
Than
any
of
her
lineaments
can
show
her
But
mistress
know
yourself
Down
on
your
knees
And
thank
heaven
fasting
for
a
good
mans
love
For
I
must
tell
you
friendly
in
your
ear
Sell
when
you
can
you
are
not
for
all
markets
Cry
the
man
mercy
love
him
take
his
offer
Foul
is
most
foul
being
foul
to
be
a
scoffer
So
take
her
to
thee
shepherd
Fare
you
well
Sweet
youth
I
pray
you
chide
a
year
together
I
had
rather
hear
you
chide
than
this
man
woo
Hes
falln
in
love
with
your
foulness
and
shell
fall
in
love
with
my
anger
If
it
be
so
as
fast
as
she
answers
thee
with
frowning
looks
Ill
sauce
her
with
bitter
words
Why
look
you
so
upon
me
For
no
ill
will
I
bear
you
I
pray
you
do
not
fall
in
love
with
me
For
I
am
falser
than
vows
made
in
wine
Besides
I
like
you
not
If
you
will
know
my
house
Tis
at
the
tuft
of
olives
here
hard
by
Will
you
go
sister
Shepherd
ply
her
hard
Come
sister
Shepherdess
look
on
him
better
And
be
not
proud
though
all
the
world
could
see
None
could
be
so
abusd
in
sight
as
he
Come
to
our
flock
Dead
shepherd
now
I
find
thy
saw
of
might
Who
ever
lovd
that
lovd
not
at
first
sight
Sweet
Phebe
Ha
what
sayst
thou
Silvius
Sweet
Phebe
pity
me
Why
I
arn
sorry
for
thee
gentle
Silvius
Wherever
sorrow
is
relief
would
be
If
you
do
sorrow
at
my
grief
in
love
By
giving
love
your
sorrow
and
my
grief
Were
both
extermind
Thou
hast
my
love
is
not
that
neighbourly
I
would
have
you
Why
that
were
covetousness
Silvius
the
time
was
that
I
hated
thee
And
yet
it
is
not
that
I
bear
thee
love
But
since
that
thou
canst
talk
of
love
so
well
Thy
company
which
erst
was
irksome
to
me
I
will
endure
and
Ill
employ
thee
too
But
do
not
look
for
further
recompense
Than
thine
own
gladness
that
thou
art
employd
So
holy
and
so
perfect
is
my
love
And
I
in
such
a
poverty
of
grace
That
I
shall
think
it
a
most
plenteous
crop
To
glean
the
broken
ears
after
the
man
That
the
main
harvest
reaps
loose
now
and
then
scattred
smile
and
that
Ill
live
upon
Knowst
thou
the
youth
that
spoke
to
me
erewhile
Not
very
well
but
I
have
met
him
oft
And
he
hath
bought
the
cottage
and
the
bounds
That
the
old
carlot
once
was
master
of
Think
not
I
love
him
though
I
ask
for
him
Tis
but
a
peevish
boy
yet
he
talks
well
But
what
care
I
for
words
Yet
words
do
well
When
he
that
speaks
them
pleases
those
that
hear
It
is
a
pretty
youth
not
very
pretty
But
sure
hes
proud
and
yet
his
pride
becomes
him
Hell
make
a
proper
man
The
best
thing
in
him
Is
his
complexion
and
faster
than
his
tongue
Did
make
offence
his
eye
did
heal
it
up
He
is
not
very
tall
yet
for
his
years
hes
tall
His
leg
is
but
soso
and
yet
tis
well
There
was
a
pretty
redness
in
his
lip
little
riper
and
more
lusty
red
Than
that
mixd
in
his
cheek
twas
just
the
difference
Betwixt
the
constant
red
and
mingled
damask
There
be
some
women
Silvius
had
they
markd
him
In
parcels
as
I
did
would
have
gone
near
To
fall
in
love
with
him
but
for
my
part
I
love
him
not
nor
hate
him
not
and
yet
I
have
more
cause
to
hate
him
than
to
love
him
For
what
had
he
to
do
to
chide
at
me
He
said
mine
eyes
were
black
and
my
hair
black
And
now
I
am
remembred
scornd
at
me
I
marvel
why
I
answerd
not
again
But
thats
all
one
omittance
is
no
quittance
Ill
write
to
him
a
very
taunting
letter
And
thou
shalt
bear
it
wilt
thou
Silvius
Phebe
with
all
my
heart
Ill
write
it
straight
The
matters
in
my
head
and
in
my
heart
I
will
be
bitter
with
him
and
passing
short
Go
with
me
Silvius
I
The
forest
Enter
and
I
prithee
pretty
youth
let
me
be
better
acquainted
with
thee
They
say
you
are
a
melancholy
fellow
I
am
so
I
do
love
it
better
than
laughing
Those
that
are
in
extremity
of
either
are
abominable
fellows
and
betray
themselves
to
every
modern
censure
worse
than
drunkards
Why
tis
good
to
be
sad
and
say
nothing
Why
then
tis
good
to
be
a
post
I
have
neither
the
scholars
melancholy
which
is
emulation
nor
the
musicians
which
is
fantastical
nor
the
courtiers
which
is
proud
nor
the
soldiers
which
is
ambitious
nor
the
lawyers
which
is
politic
nor
the
ladys
which
is
nice
nor
the
lovers
which
is
all
these
but
it
is
a
melancholy
of
mine
own
compounded
of
many
simples
extracted
from
many
objects
and
indeed
the
sundry
contemplation
of
my
travels
in
which
my
often
rumination
wraps
me
in
a
most
humorous
sadness
traveller
By
my
faith
you
have
great
reason
to
be
sad
I
fear
you
have
sold
your
own
lands
to
see
other
mens
then
to
have
seen
much
and
to
have
nothing
is
to
have
rich
eyes
and
poor
hands
Yes
I
have
gaind
my
experience
Enter
And
your
experience
makes
you
sad
I
had
rather
have
a
fool
to
make
me
merry
than
experience
to
make
me
sad
and
to
travel
for
it
too
Good
day
and
happiness
dear
Rosalind
Nay
then
God
buy
you
an
you
talk
in
blank
verse
Farewell
Monsieur
Traveller
look
you
lisp
and
wear
strange
suits
disable
all
the
benefits
of
your
own
country
be
out
of
love
with
your
nativity
and
almost
chide
God
for
making
you
that
countenance
you
are
or
I
will
scarce
think
you
have
swam
in
a
gondola
have
you
been
all
this
while
You
a
lover
An
you
serve
me
such
another
trick
never
come
in
my
sight
more
My
fair
Rosalind
I
come
within
an
hour
of
my
promise
Break
an
hours
promise
in
love
He
that
will
divide
a
minute
into
a
thousand
parts
and
break
but
a
part
of
the
thousand
part
of
a
minute
in
the
affairs
of
love
it
may
be
said
of
him
that
Cupid
hath
clappd
him
o
th
shoulder
but
Ill
warrant
him
heartwhole
Pardon
me
dear
Rosalind
Nay
an
you
be
so
tardy
come
no
more
in
my
sight
I
had
as
lief
be
wood
of
a
snail
Of
a
snail
Ay
of
a
snail
for
though
he
comes
slowly
he
carries
his
house
on
his
head
a
better
jointure
I
think
than
you
make
a
woman
besides
he
brings
his
destiny
with
him
Whats
that
Why
horns
which
such
as
you
are
fain
to
be
beholding
to
your
wives
for
but
he
comes
armed
in
his
fortune
and
prevents
the
slander
of
his
wife
Virtue
is
no
hornmaker
and
my
Rosalind
is
virtuous
And
I
am
your
Rosalind
It
pleases
him
to
call
you
so
but
he
hath
a
Rosalind
of
a
better
leer
than
you
Come
woo
me
woo
me
for
now
I
am
in
a
holiday
humour
and
like
enough
to
consent
What
would
you
say
to
me
now
an
I
were
your
very
very
Rosalind
I
would
kiss
before
I
spoke
Nay
you
were
better
speak
first
and
when
you
were
gravelld
for
lack
of
matter
you
might
take
occasion
to
kiss
Very
good
orators
when
they
are
out
they
will
spit
and
for
lovers
lacking
God
warn
us
matter
the
cleanliest
shift
is
to
kiss
How
if
the
kiss
be
denied
Then
she
puts
you
to
entreaty
and
there
begins
new
matter
Who
could
be
out
being
before
his
beloved
mistress
Marry
that
should
you
if
I
were
your
mistress
or
I
should
think
my
honesty
ranker
than
my
wit
What
of
my
suit
Not
out
of
your
apparel
and
yet
out
of
your
suit
Am
not
I
your
Rosalind
I
take
some
joy
to
say
you
are
because
I
would
be
talking
of
her
Well
in
her
person
I
say
I
will
not
have
you
Then
in
mine
own
person
I
die
No
faith
die
by
attorney
The
poor
world
is
almost
six
thousand
years
old
and
in
all
this
time
there
was
not
any
man
died
in
his
own
person
videlicet
in
a
lovecause
Troilus
had
his
brains
dashd
out
with
a
Grecian
club
yet
he
did
what
he
could
to
die
before
and
he
is
one
of
the
patterns
of
love
Leander
he
would
have
livd
many
a
fair
year
though
Hero
had
turnd
nun
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
hot
midsummer
night
for
good
youth
he
went
but
forth
to
wash
him
in
the
Hellespont
and
being
taken
with
the
cramp
was
drownd
and
the
foolish
chroniclers
of
that
age
found
it
was
Hero
of
Sestos
But
these
are
all
lies
men
have
died
from
time
to
time
and
worms
have
eaten
them
but
not
for
love
I
would
not
have
my
right
Rosalind
of
this
mind
for
I
protest
her
frown
might
kill
me
By
this
hand
it
will
not
kill
a
fly
But
come
now
I
will
be
your
Rosalind
in
a
more
comingon
disposition
and
ask
me
what
you
will
I
will
grant
it
Then
love
me
Rosalind
Yes
faith
will
I
Fridays
and
Saturdays
and
all
And
wilt
thou
have
me
Ay
and
twenty
such
What
sayest
thou
Are
you
not
good
I
hope
so
Why
then
can
one
desire
too
much
of
a
good
thing
Come
sister
you
shall
be
the
priest
and
marry
us
Give
me
your
hand
Orlando
What
do
you
say
sister
Pray
thee
marry
us
I
cannot
say
the
words
You
must
begin
Will
you
Orlando
Go
to
Will
you
Orlando
have
to
wife
this
Rosalind
I
will
Ay
but
when
Why
now
as
fast
as
she
can
marry
us
Then
you
must
say
I
take
thee
Rosalind
for
wife
I
take
thee
Rosalind
for
wife
I
might
ask
you
for
your
commission
but
I
do
take
thee
Orlando
for
my
husband
Theres
a
girl
goes
before
the
priest
and
certainly
a
womans
thought
runs
before
her
actions
So
do
all
thoughts
they
are
wingd
Now
tell
me
how
long
you
would
have
her
after
you
have
possessd
her
For
ever
and
a
day
Say
a
day
without
the
ever
No
no
Orlando
men
are
April
when
they
woo
December
when
they
wed
maids
are
May
when
they
are
maids
but
the
sky
changes
when
they
are
wives
I
will
be
more
jealous
of
thee
than
a
Barbary
cockpigeon
over
his
hen
more
clamorous
than
a
parrot
against
rain
more
newfangled
than
an
ape
more
giddy
in
my
desires
than
a
monkey
I
will
weep
for
nothing
like
Diana
in
the
fountain
and
I
will
do
that
when
you
are
disposd
to
be
merry
I
will
laugh
like
a
hyen
and
that
when
thou
are
inclind
to
sleep
But
will
my
Rosalind
do
so
By
my
life
she
will
do
as
I
do
but
she
is
wise
Or
else
she
could
not
have
the
wit
to
do
this
The
wiser
the
waywarder
Make
the
doors
upon
a
womans
wit
and
it
will
out
at
the
casement
shut
that
and
twill
out
at
the
keyhole
stop
that
twill
fly
with
the
smoke
out
at
the
chimney
man
that
had
a
wife
with
such
a
wit
he
might
say
Wit
whither
wilt
Nay
you
might
keep
that
check
for
it
till
you
met
your
wifes
wit
going
to
your
neighbours
bed
And
what
wit
could
wit
have
to
excuse
that
Marry
to
say
she
came
to
seek
you
there
You
shall
never
take
her
without
her
answer
unless
you
take
her
without
her
tongue
that
woman
that
cannot
make
her
fault
her
husbands
occasion
let
her
never
nurse
her
child
herself
for
she
will
breed
it
like
a
fool
For
these
two
hours
Rosalind
I
will
leave
thee
Alas
dear
love
I
cannot
lack
thee
two
hours
I
must
attend
the
Duke
at
dinner
by
two
oclock
I
will
be
with
thee
again
Ay
go
your
ways
go
your
ways
I
knew
what
you
would
prove
my
friends
told
me
as
much
and
I
thought
no
less
That
flattering
tongue
of
yours
won
me
Tis
but
one
cast
away
and
so
come
death
Two
oclock
is
your
hour
Ay
sweet
Rosalind
By
my
troth
and
in
good
earnest
and
so
God
mend
me
and
by
all
pretty
oaths
that
are
not
dangerous
if
you
break
one
jot
of
your
promise
or
come
one
minute
behind
your
hour
I
will
think
you
the
most
pathetical
breakpromise
and
the
most
hollow
lover
and
the
most
unworthy
of
her
you
call
Rosalind
that
may
be
chosen
out
of
the
gross
band
of
the
unfaithful
Therefore
beware
my
censure
and
keep
your
promise
With
no
less
religion
than
if
thou
wert
indeed
my
Rosalind
so
adieu
Well
Time
is
the
old
justice
that
examines
all
such
offenders
and
let
Time
try
Adieu
You
have
simply
misusd
our
sex
in
your
loveprate
We
must
have
your
doublet
and
hose
pluckd
over
your
head
and
show
the
world
what
the
bird
hath
done
to
her
own
nest
coz
coz
coz
my
pretty
little
coz
that
thou
didst
know
how
many
fathom
deep
I
am
in
love
But
it
cannot
be
sounded
my
affection
hath
an
unknown
bottom
like
the
Bay
of
Portugal
Or
rather
bottomless
that
as
fast
as
you
pour
affection
in
it
runs
out
No
that
same
wicked
bastard
of
Venus
that
was
begot
of
thought
conceivd
of
spleen
and
born
of
madness
that
blind
rascally
boy
that
abuses
every
ones
eyes
because
his
own
are
out
let
him
be
judge
how
deep
I
am
in
love
Ill
tell
thee
Aliena
I
cannot
be
out
of
the
sight
of
Orlando
Ill
go
find
a
shadow
and
sigh
till
he
come
And
Ill
sleep
How
say
you
now
Is
it
not
past
two
oclock
And
here
much
Orlando
I
warrant
you
with
pure
love
and
troubled
brain
he
hath
taen
his
bow
and
arrows
and
is
gone
forth
to
sleep
Look
who
comes
here
Enter
My
errand
is
to
you
fair
youth
My
gentle
Phebe
did
bid
me
give
you
this
I
know
not
the
contents
but
as
I
guess
By
the
stern
brow
and
waspish
action
Which
she
did
use
as
she
was
writing
of
it
It
bears
an
angry
tenour
Pardon
me
I
am
but
as
a
guiltless
messenger
Patience
herself
would
startle
at
this
letter
And
play
the
swaggerer
Bear
this
bear
all
She
says
I
am
not
fair
that
I
lack
manners
She
calls
me
proud
and
that
she
could
not
love
me
Were
man
as
rare
as
Phoenix
Ods
my
will
Her
love
is
not
the
hare
that
I
do
hunt
Why
writes
she
so
to
me
Well
shepherd
well
This
is
a
letter
of
your
own
device
No
I
protest
I
know
not
the
contents
Phebe
did
write
it
Come
come
you
are
a
fool
And
turnd
into
the
extremity
of
love
I
saw
her
hand
she
has
a
leathern
hand
freestonecolourd
hand
I
verily
did
think
That
her
old
gloves
were
on
but
twas
her
hands
She
has
a
huswifes
hand
but
thats
no
matter
I
say
she
never
did
invent
this
letter
This
is
a
mans
invention
and
his
hand
Sure
it
is
hers
Why
tis
a
boisterous
and
a
cruel
style
style
for
challengers
Why
she
defies
me
Like
Turk
to
Christian
Womens
gentle
brain
Could
not
drop
forth
such
giantrude
invention
Such
Ethiope
words
blacker
in
their
effect
Than
in
their
countenance
Will
you
hear
the
letter
So
please
you
for
I
never
heard
it
yet
Yet
heard
too
much
of
Phebes
cruelty
She
Phebes
me
mark
how
the
tyrant
writes
Reads
Art
thou
god
to
shepherd
turnd
That
a
maidens
heart
hath
burnd
Can
a
woman
rail
thus
Call
you
this
railing
Why
thy
godhead
laid
apart
Warrst
thou
with
a
womans
heart
Did
you
ever
hear
such
railing
Whiles
the
eye
of
man
did
woo
me
That
could
do
no
vengeance
to
me
Meaning
me
a
beast
If
the
scorn
of
your
bright
eyne
Have
power
to
raise
such
love
in
mine
Alack
in
me
what
strange
effect
Would
they
work
in
mild
aspect
Whiles
you
chid
me
I
did
love
How
then
might
your
prayers
move
He
that
brings
this
love
to
the
Little
knows
this
love
in
me
And
by
him
seal
up
thy
mind
Whether
that
thy
youth
and
kind
Will
the
faithful
offer
take
Of
me
and
all
that
I
can
make
Or
else
by
him
my
love
deny
And
then
Ill
study
how
to
die
Call
you
this
chiding
Alas
poor
shepherd
Do
you
pity
him
No
he
deserves
no
pity
Wilt
thou
love
such
a
woman
What
to
make
thee
an
instrument
and
play
false
strains
upon
thee
Not
to
be
endurd
Well
go
your
way
to
her
for
I
see
love
hath
made
thee
tame
snake
and
say
this
to
her
that
if
she
love
me
I
charge
her
to
love
thee
if
she
will
not
I
will
never
have
her
unless
thou
entreat
for
her
If
you
be
a
true
lover
hence
and
not
a
word
for
here
comes
more
company
Enter
Good
morrow
fair
ones
pray
you
if
you
know
Where
in
the
purlieus
of
this
forest
stands
sheepcote
fencd
about
with
olive
trees
West
of
this
place
down
in
the
neighbour
bottom
The
rank
of
osiers
by
the
murmuring
stream
Left
on
your
right
hand
brings
you
to
the
place
But
at
this
hour
the
house
doth
keep
itself
Theres
none
within
If
that
an
eye
may
profit
by
a
tongue
Then
should
I
know
you
by
description
Such
garments
and
such
years
The
boy
is
fair
Of
female
favour
and
bestows
himself
Like
a
ripe
sister
the
woman
low
And
browner
than
her
brother
Are
not
you
The
owner
of
the
house
I
did
inquire
for
It
is
no
boast
being
askd
to
say
we
are
Orlando
doth
commend
him
to
you
both
And
to
that
youth
he
calls
his
Rosalind
He
sends
this
bloody
napkin
Are
you
he
I
am
What
must
we
understand
by
this
Some
of
my
shame
if
you
will
know
of
me
What
man
I
am
and
how
and
why
and
where
This
handkercher
was
staind
I
pray
you
tell
it
When
last
the
young
Orlando
parted
from
you
He
left
a
promise
to
return
again
Within
an
hour
and
pacing
through
the
forest
Chewing
the
food
of
sweet
and
bitter
fancy
Lo
what
befell
He
threw
his
eye
aside
And
mark
what
object
did
present
itself
Under
an
oak
whose
boughs
were
mossd
with
age
And
high
top
bald
with
dry
antiquity
wretched
ragged
man
oergrown
with
hair
Lay
sleeping
on
his
back
About
his
neck
green
and
gilded
snake
had
wreathd
itself
Who
with
her
head
nimble
in
threats
approachd
The
opening
of
his
mouth
but
suddenly
Seeing
Orlando
it
unlinkd
itself
And
with
indented
glides
did
slip
away
Into
a
bush
under
which
bushs
shade
lioness
with
udders
all
drawn
dry
Lay
couching
head
on
ground
with
catlike
watch
When
that
the
sleeping
man
should
stir
for
tis
The
royal
disposition
of
that
beast
To
prey
on
nothing
that
doth
seem
as
dead
This
seen
Orlando
did
approach
the
man
And
found
it
was
his
brother
his
elder
brother
I
have
heard
him
speak
of
that
same
brother
And
he
did
render
him
the
most
unnatural
That
livd
amongst
men
And
well
he
might
so
do
For
well
I
know
he
was
unnatural
But
to
Orlando
did
he
leave
him
there
Food
to
the
suckd
and
hungry
lioness
Twice
did
he
turn
his
back
and
purposd
so
But
kindness
nobler
ever
than
revenge
And
nature
stronger
than
his
just
occasion
Made
him
give
battle
to
the
lioness
Who
quickly
fell
before
him
in
which
hurtling
From
miserable
slumber
I
awakd
Are
you
his
brother
Wast
you
he
rescud
Wast
you
that
did
so
oft
contrive
to
kill
him
Twas
I
but
tis
not
I
I
do
not
shame
To
tell
you
what
I
was
since
my
conversion
So
sweetly
tastes
being
the
thing
I
am
But
for
the
bloody
napkin
By
and
by
When
from
the
first
to
last
betwixt
us
two
Tears
our
recountments
had
most
kindly
bathd
As
how
I
came
into
that
desert
place
In
brief
he
led
me
to
the
gentle
Duke
Who
gave
me
fresh
array
and
entertainment
Committing
me
unto
my
brothers
love
Who
led
me
instantly
unto
his
cave
There
strippd
himself
and
here
upon
his
arm
The
lioness
had
torn
some
flesh
away
Which
all
this
while
had
bled
and
now
he
fainted
And
cried
in
fainting
upon
Rosalind
Brief
I
recoverd
him
bound
up
his
wound
And
after
some
small
space
being
strong
at
heart
He
sent
me
hither
stranger
as
I
am
To
tell
this
story
that
you
might
excuse
His
broken
promise
and
to
give
this
napkin
Dyd
in
his
blood
unto
the
shepherd
youth
That
he
in
sport
doth
call
his
Rosalind
swoons
Why
how
now
Ganymede
sweet
Ganymede
Many
will
swoon
when
they
do
look
on
blood
There
is
more
in
it
Cousin
Ganymede
Look
he
recovers
I
would
I
were
at
home
Well
lead
you
thither
I
pray
you
will
you
take
him
by
the
arm
Be
of
good
cheer
youth
You
a
man
You
lack
a
mans
heart
I
do
so
I
confess
it
Ah
sirrah
a
body
would
think
this
was
well
counterfeited
I
pray
you
tell
your
brother
how
well
I
counterfeited
Heighho
This
was
not
counterfeit
there
is
too
great
testimony
in
your
complexion
that
it
was
a
passion
of
earnest
Counterfeit
I
assure
you
Well
then
take
a
good
heart
and
counterfeit
to
be
a
man
So
I
do
but
i
faith
I
should
have
been
a
woman
by
right
Come
you
look
paler
and
paler
pray
you
draw
homewards
Good
sir
go
with
us
That
will
I
for
I
must
bear
answer
back
How
you
excuse
my
brother
Rosalind
I
shall
devise
something
but
I
pray
you
commend
my
counterfeiting
to
him
Will
you
go
I
The
forest
Enter
and
We
shall
find
a
time
Audrey
patience
gentle
Audrey
Faith
the
priest
was
good
enough
for
all
the
old
gentlemans
saying
most
wicked
Sir
Oliver
Audrey
a
most
vile
Martext
But
Audrey
there
is
a
youth
here
in
the
forest
lays
claim
to
you
Ay
I
know
who
tis
he
hath
no
interest
in
me
in
the
world
here
comes
the
man
you
mean
Enter
It
is
meat
and
drink
to
me
to
see
a
clown
By
my
troth
we
that
have
good
wits
have
much
to
answer
for
we
shall
be
flouting
we
cannot
hold
Good
evn
Audrey
God
ye
good
evn
William
And
good
evn
to
you
sir
Good
evn
gentle
friend
Cover

thy
head
nay
prithee

How
old
are
you
friend
Five
and
twenty
sir
ripe
age
Is
thy
name
William
William
sir
fair
name
Wast
born
i
th
forest
here
Ay
sir
I
thank
God
Thank
God
good
answer
Art
rich
Faith
sir
so
so
So
so
is
good
very
good
very
excellent
good
and
yet
it
is
not
it
is
but
so
so
Art
thou
wise
Ay
sir
I
have
a
pretty
wit
Why
thou
sayst
well
I
do
now
remember
a
saying
The
fool
doth
think
he
is
wise
but
the
wise
man
knows
himself
to
be
a
fool
The
heathen
philosopher
when
he
had
a
desire
to
eat
a
grape
would
open
his
lips
when
he
put
it
into
his
mouth
meaning
thereby
that
grapes
were
made
to
eat
and
lips
to
open
You
do
love
this
maid
I
do
sir
Give
me
your
hand
Art
thou
learned
No
sir
Then
learn
this
of
me
to
have
is
to
have
for
it
is
a
figure
in
rhetoric
that
drink
being
pourd
out
of
cup
into
a
glass
by
filling
the
one
doth
empty
the
other
for
all
your
writers
do
consent
that
ipse
is
he
now
you
are
not
ipse
for
I
am
he
Which
he
sir
He
sir
that
must
marry
this
woman
Therefore
you
clown

Ifaith
ifaith
and
both
in

like
two

on
a
horse
It
was
a
lover
and
his
lass
With
a
hey
and
a
ho
and
a
hey
nonino
That
oer
the
green
cornfield
did

In

the

When

Sweet
lovers

Between

acres
of

With

These
pretty

would
lie
In

This

they
began
that

With

How

In

For

Truly

By

Come

Proceed

my

And
by
the
doom
of
death
end
woes
and
all
Merchant
of
Syracuse
plead
no
more
I
am
not
partial
to
infringe
our
laws
The
enmity
and
discord
which
of
late
Sprung
from
the
rancorous
outrage
of
your
duke
To
merchants
our
welldealing
countrymen
Who
wanting
guilders
to
redeem
their
lives
Have
seald
his
rigorous
statutes
with
their
bloods
Excludes
all
pity
from
our
threatning
looks
For
since
the
mortal
and
intestine
jars
Twixt
thy
seditious
countrymen
and
us
It
hath
in
solemn
synods
been
decreed
Both
by
the
Syracusians
and
ourselves
To
admit
no
traffic
to
our
adverse
towns
Nay
more
if
any
born
at
Ephesus
Be
seen
at
any
Syracusian
marts
and
fairs
Again
if
any
Syracusian
born
Come
to
the
bay
of
Ephesushe
dies
His
goods
confiscate
to
the
Dukes
dispose
Unless
a
thousand
marks
be
levied
To
quit
the
penalty
and
to
ransom
him
Thy
substance
valued
at
the
highest
rate
Cannot
amount
unto
a
hundred
marks
Therefore
by
law
thou
art
condemnd
to
die
Yet
this
my
comfort
when
your
words
are
done
My
woes
end
likewise
with
the
evening
sun
Well
Syracusian
say
in
brief
the
cause
Why
thou
departedst
from
thy
native
home
And
for
what
cause
thou
camst
to
Ephesus
heavier
task
could
not
have
been
imposd
Than
I
to
speak
my
griefs
unspeakable
Yet
that
the
world
may
witness
that
my
end
Was
wrought
by
nature
not
by
vile
offence
Ill
utter
what
my
sorrow
gives
me
leave
In
Syracuse
was
I
born
and
wed
Unto
a
woman
happy
but
for
me
And
by
me
had
not
our
hap
been
bad
With
her
I
livd
in
joy
our
wealth
increasd
By
prosperous
voyages
I
often
made
To
Epidamnum
till
my
factors
death
And
the
great
care
of
goods
at
random
left
Drew
me
from
kind
embracements
of
my
spouse
From
whom
my
absence
was
not
six
months
old
Before
herself
almost
at
fainting
under
The
pleasing
punishment
that
women
bear
Had
made
provision
for
her
following
me
And
soon
and
safe
arrived
where
I
was
There
had
she
not
been
long
but
she
became
joyful
mother
of
two
goodly
sons
And
which
was
strange
the
one
so
like
the
other
As
could
not
be
disdnguishd
but
by
names
That
very
hour
and
in
the
selfsame
inn
mean
woman
was
delivered
Of
such
a
burden
male
twins
both
alike
Those
for
their
parents
were
exceeding
poor
I
bought
and
brought
up
to
attend
my
sons
My
wife
not
meanly
proud
of
two
such
boys
Made
daily
motions
for
our
home
return
Unwilling
I
agreed
Alas
too
soon
We
came
aboard
league
from
Epidamnum
had
we
saild
Before
the
alwayswindobeying
deep
Gave
any
tragic
instance
of
our
harm
But
longer
did
we
not
retain
much
hope
For
what
obscured
light
the
heavens
did
grant
Did
but
convey
unto
our
fearful
minds
doubtful
warrant
of
immediate
death
Which
though
myself
would
gladly
have
embracd
Yet
the
incessant
weepings
of
my
wife
Weeping
before
for
what
she
saw
must
come
And
piteous
plainings
of
the
pretty
babes
That
mournd
for
fashion
ignorant
what
to
fear
Forcd
me
to
seek
delays
for
them
and
me
And
this
it
was
for
other
means
was
none
The
sailors
sought
for
safety
by
our
boat
And
left
the
ship
then
sinkingripe
to
us
My
wife
more
careful
for
the
latterborn
Had
fastned
him
unto
a
small
spare
mast
Such
as
seafaring
men
provide
for
storms
To
him
one
of
the
other
twins
was
bound
Whilst
I
had
been
like
heedful
of
the
other
The
children
thus
disposd
my
wife
and
I
Fixing
our
eyes
on
whom
our
care
was
fixd
Fastned
ourselves
at
either
end
the
mast
And
floating
straight
obedient
to
the
stream
Was
carried
towards
Corinth
as
we
thought
At
length
the
sun
gazing
upon
the
earth
Dispersd
those
vapours
that
offended
us
And
by
the
benefit
of
his
wished
light
The
seas
waxd
calm
and
we
discovered
Two
ships
from
far
making
amain
to
us
Of
Corinth
that
of
Epidaurus
this
But
ere
they
cameO
let
me
say
no
more
Gather
the
sequel
by
that
went
before
Nay
forward
old
man
do
not
break
off
so
For
we
may
pity
though
not
pardon
thee
had
the
gods
done
so
I
had
not
now
Worthily
termd
them
merciless
to
us
For
ere
the
ships
could
meet
by
twice
five
leagues
We
were
encountred
by
a
mighty
rock
Which
being
violently
borne
upon
Our
helpful
ship
was
splitted
in
the
midst
So
that
in
this
unjust
divorce
of
us
Fortune
had
left
to
both
of
us
alike
What
to
delight
in
what
to
sorrow
for
Her
part
poor
soul
seeming
as
burdened
With
lesser
weight
but
not
with
lesser
woe
Was
carried
with
more
speed
before
the
wind
And
in
our
sight
they
three
were
taken
up
By
fishermen
of
Corinth
as
we
thought
At
length
another
ship
had
seizd
on
us
And
knowing
whom
it
was
their
hap
to
save
Gave
healthful
welcome
to
their
shipwreckd
guests
And
would
have
reft
the
fishers
of
their
prey
Had
not
their
bark
been
very
slow
of
sail
And
therefore
homeward
did
they
bend
their
course
Thus
have
you
heard
me
severd
from
my
bliss
That
by
misfortunes
was
my
life
prolongd
To
tell
sad
stories
of
my
own
mishaps
And
for
the
sake
of
them
thou
sorrowest
for
Do
me
the
favour
to
dilate
at
full
What
have
befalln
of
them
and
thee
till
now
My
youngest
boy
and
yet
my
eldest
care
At
eighteen
years
became
inquisitive
After
his
brother
and
importund
me
That
his
attendantso
his
case
was
like
Reft
of
his
brother
but
retaind
his
name
Might
bear
him
company
in
the
quest
of
him
Whom
whilst
I
laboured
of
a
love
to
see
I
hazarded
the
loss
of
whom
I
lovd
Five
summers
have
I
spent
in
farthest
Greece
Roaming
clean
through
the
bounds
of
Asia
And
coasting
homeward
came
to
Ephesus
Hopeless
to
find
yet
loath
to
leave
unsought
Or
that
or
any
place
that
harbours
men
But
here
must
end
the
story
of
my
life
And
happy
were
I
in
my
timely
death
Could
all
my
travels
warrant
me
they
live
Hapless
Aegeon
whom
the
fates
have
markd
To
bear
the
extremity
of
dire
mishap
Now
trust
me
were
it
not
against
our
laws
Against
my
crown
my
oath
my
dignity
Which
princes
would
they
may
not
disannul
My
soul
should
sue
as
advocate
for
thee
But
though
thou
art
adjudged
to
the
death
And
passed
sentence
may
not
be
recalld
But
to
our
honours
great
disparagement
Yet
will
I
favour
thee
in
what
I
can
Therefore
merchant
Ill
limit
thee
this
day
To
seek
thy
help
by
beneficial
hap
Try
all
the
friends
thou
hast
in
Ephesus
Beg
thou
or
borrow
to
make
up
the
sum
And
live
if
no
then
thou
art
doomd
to
die
Gaoler
take
him
to
thy
custody
I
will
my
lord
Hopeless
and
helpless
doth
Aegeon
wend
But
to
procrastinate
his
lifeless
end
The
gold
I
gave
to
Dromio
is
laid
up
Safe
at
the
Centaur
and
the
heedful
slave
Is
wandred
forth
in
care
to
seek
me
out
By
computation
and
mine
hosts
report
I
could
not
speak
with
Dromio
since
at
first
I
sent
him
from
the
mart
See
here
he
comes
Enter
How
now
sir
is
your
merry
humour
alterd
As
you
love
strokes
so
jest
with
me
again
You
know
no
Centaur
You
receivd
no
gold
Your
mistress
sent
to
have
me
home
to
dinner
My
house
was
at
the
Phoenix
Wast
thou
mad
That
thus
so
madly
thou
didst
answer
me
What
answer
sir
When
spake
I
such
a
word
Even
now
even
here
not
half
an
hour
since
I
did
not
see
you
since
you
sent
me
hence
Home
to
the
Centaur
with
the
gold
you
gave
me
Villain
thou
didst
deny
the
golds
receipt
And
toldst
me
of
a
mistress
and
a
dinner
For
which
I
hope
thou
feltst
I
was
displeasd
I
am
glad
to
see
you
in
this
merry
vein
What
means
this
jest
I
pray
you
master
tell
me
Yea
dost
thou
jeer
and
flout
me
in
the
teeth
Thinkst
thou
I
jest
Hold
take
thou
that
and
that
Beating
him
Hold
sir
for
Gods
sake
Now
your
jest
is
earnest
Upon
what
bargain
do
you
give
it
me
Because
that
I
familiarly
sometimes
Do
use
you
for
my
fool
and
chat
with
you
Your
sauciness
will
jest
upon
my
love
And
make
a
common
of
my
serious
hours
When
the
sun
shines
let
foolish
gnats
make
sport
But
creep
in
crannies
when
he
hides
his
beams
If
you
will
jest
with
me
know
my
aspect
And
fashion
your
demeanour
to
my
looks
Or
I
will
beat
this
method
in
your
sconce
Sconce
call
you
it
So
you
would
leave
battering
I
had
rather
have
it
a
head
An
you
use
these
blows
long
I
must
get
a
sconce
for
my
head
and
insconce
it
too
or
else
I
shall
seek
my
wit
in
my
shoulders
But
I
pray
sir
why
am
I
beaten
Dost
thou
not
know
Nothing
sir
but
that
I
am
beaten
Shall
I
tell
you
why
Ay
sir
and
wherefore
for
they
say
every
why
hath
a
wherefore
Why
first
for
flouting
me
and
then
wherefore
For
urging
it
the
second
time
to
me
Was
there
ever
any
man
thus
beaten
out
of
season
When
in
the
why
and
the
wherefore
is
neither
rhyme
nor
reason
Well
sir
I
thank
you
Thank
me
sir
for
what
Marry
sir
for
this
something
that
you
gave
me
for
nothing
Ill
make
you
amends
next
to
give
you
nothing
for
something
But
say
sir
is
it
dinnertime
No
sir
I
think
the
meat
wants
that
I
have
In
good
time
sir
whats
that
Basting
Well
sir
then
twill
be
dry
If
it
be
sir
I
pray
you
eat
none
of
it
Your
reason
Lest
it
make
you
choleric
and
purchase
me
another
dry
basting
Well
sir
learn
to
jest
in
good
time
theres
a
time
for
all
things
I
durst
have
denied
that
before
you
were
so
choleric
By
what
rule
sir
Marry
sir
by
a
rule
as
plain
as
the
plain
bald
pate
of
Father
Time
himself
Lets
hear
it
Theres
no
time
for
a
man
to
recover
his
hair
that
grows
bald
by
nature
May
he
not
do
it
by
fine
and
recovery
Yes
to
pay
a
fine
for
a
periwig
and
recover
the
lost
hair
of
another
man
Why
is
Time
such
a
niggard
of
hair
being
as
it
is
so
plentiful
an
excrement
Because
it
is
a
blessing
that
he
bestows
on
beasts
and
what
he
hath
scanted
men
in
hair
he
hath
given
them
in
wit
Why
but
theres
many
a
man
hath
more
hair
than
wit
Not
a
man
of
those
but
he
hath
the
wit
to
lose
his
hair
Why
thou
didst
conclude
hairy
men
plain
dealers
without
wit
The
plainer
dealer
the
sooner
lost
yet
he
loseth
it
in
a
kind
of
jollity
For
what
reason
For
two
and
sound
ones
too
Nay
not
sound
I
pray
you
Sure
ones
then
Nay
not
sure
in
a
thing
falsing
Certain
ones
then
Name
them
The
one
to
save
the
money
that
he
spends
in
tiring
the
other
that
at
dinner
they
should
not
drop
in
his
porridge
You
would
all
this
time
have
provd
there
is
no
time
for
all
things
Marry
and
did
sir
namely
no
time
to
recover
hair
lost
by
nature
But
your
reason
was
not
substantial
why
there
is
no
time
to
recover
Thus
I
mend
it
Time
himself
is
bald
and
therefore
to
the
worlds
end
will
have
bald
followers
I
knew
twould
be
a
bald
conclusion
But
soft
who
wafts
us
yonder
Enter
and
Ay
ay
Antipholus
look
strange
and
frown
Some
other
mistress
hath
thy
sweet
aspects
I
am
not
Adriana
nor
thy
wife
The
time
was
once
when
thou
unurgd
wouldst
vow
That
never
words
were
music
to
thine
ear
That
never
object
pleasing
in
thine
eye
That
never
touch
well
welcome
to
thy
hand
That
never
meat
sweetsavourd
in
thy
taste
Unless
I
spake
or
lookd
or
touchd
or
carvd
to
thee
How
comes
it
now
my
husband
how
comes
it
That
thou
art
then
estranged
from
thyself
Thyself
I
call
it
being
strange
to
me
That
undividable
incorporate
Am
better
than
thy
dear
selfs
better
part
Ah
do
not
tear
away
thyself
from
me
For
know
my
love
as
easy
mayst
thou
fall
drop
of
water
in
the
breaking
gulf
And
take
unmingled
thence
that
drop
again
Without
addition
or
diminishing
As
take
from
me
thyself
and
not
me
too
How
dearly
would
it
touch
thee
to
the
quick
Shouldst
thou
but
hear
I
were
licentious
And
that
this
body
consecrate
to
thee
By
ruffian
lust
should
be
contaminate
Wouldst
thou
not
spit
at
me
and
spurn
at
me
And
hurl
the
name
of
husband
in
my
face
And
tear
the
staind
skin
off
my
harlotbrow
And
from
my
false
hand
cut
the
weddingring
And
break
it
with
a
deepdivorcing
vow
I
know
thou
canst
and
therefore
see
thou
do
it
I
am
possessd
with
an
adulterate
blot
My
blood
is
mingled
with
the
crime
of
lust
For
if
we
two
be
one
and
thou
play
false
I
do
digest
the
poison
of
thy
flesh
Being
strumpeted
by
thy
contagion
Keep
then
fair
league
and
truce
with
thy
true
bed
I
live
disstaind
thou
undishonoured
Plead
you
to
me
fair
dame
I
know
you
not
In
Ephesus
I
am
but
two
hours
old
As
strange
unto
your
town
as
to
your
talk
Who
every
word
by
all
my
wit
being
scannd
Wants
wit
in
all
one
word
to
understand
Fie
brother
how
the
world
is
changd
with
you
When
were
you
wont
to
use
my
sister
thus
She
sent
for
you
by
Dromio
home
to
dinner
By
Dromio
By
me
By
thee
and
this
thou
didst
return
from
him
That
he
did
buffet
thee
and
in
his
blows
Denied
my
house
for
his
me
for
his
wife
Did
you
converse
sir
with
this
gentlewoman
What
is
the
course
and
drift
of
your
compact
I
Sir
I
never
saw
her
till
this
time
Villain
thou
liest
for
even
her
very
words
Didst
thou
deliver
to
me
on
the
mart
I
never
spake
with
her
in
all
my
life
How
can
she
thus
then
call
us
by
our
names
Unless
it
be
by
inspiration
How
ill
agrees
it
with
your
gravity
To
counterfeit
thus
grossly
with
your
slave
Abetting
him
to
thwart
me
in
my
mood
Be
it
my
wrong
you
are
from
me
exempt
But
wrong
not
that
wrong
with
a
more
contempt
Come
I
will
fasten
on
this
sleeve
of
thine
Thou
art
an
elm
my
husband
I
a
vine
Whose
weakness
married
to
thy
stronger
state
Makes
me
with
thy
strength
to
communicate
If
aught
possess
thee
from
me
it
is
dross
Usurping
ivy
brier
or
idle
moss
Who
all
for
want
of
pruning
with
intrusion
Infect
thy
sap
and
live
on
thy
confusion
To
me
she
speaks
she
moves
me
for
her
theme
What
was
I
married
to
her
in
my
dream
Or
sleep
I
now
and
think
I
hear
all
this
What
error
drives
our
eyes
and
ears
amiss
Until
I
know
this
sure
uncertainty
Ill
entertain
the
offerd
fallacy
Dromio
go
bid
the
servants
spread
for
dinner
for
my
beads
I
cross
me
for
sinner
This
is
the
fairy
land
spite
of
spites
We
talk
with
goblins
owls
and
sprites
If
we
obey
them
not
this
will
ensue
Theyll
suck
our
breath
or
pinch
us
black
and
blue
Why
pratst
thou
to
thyself
and
answerst
not
Dromio
thou
drone
thou
snail
thou
slug
thou
sot
I
am
transformed
master
am
not
I
I
think
thou
art
in
mind
and
so
am
I
Nay
master
both
in
mind
and
in
my
shape
Thou
hast
thine
own
form
No
I
am
an
ape
If
thou
art
changd
to
aught
tis
to
an
ass
Tis
true
she
rides
me
and
I
long
for
grass
Tis
so
I
am
an
ass
else
it
could
never
be
But
I
should
know
her
as
well
as
she
knows
me
Come
come
no
longer
will
I
be
a
fool
To
put
the
finger
in
the
eye
and
weep
Whilst
man
and
master
laughs
my
woes
to
scorn
Come
sir
to
dinner
Dromio
keep
the
gate
Husband
Ill
dine
above
with
you
today
And
shrive
you
of
a
thousand
idle
pranks
Sirrah
if
any
ask
you
for
your
master
Say
he
dines
forth
and
let
no
creature
enter
Come
sister
Dromio
play
the
porter
well
Am
I
in
earth
in
heaven
or
in
hell
Sleeping
or
waking
mad
or
welladvisd
Known
unto
these
and
to
myself
disguisd
Ill
say
as
they
say
and
persever
so
And
in
this
mist
at
all
adventures
go
Master
shall
I
be
porter
at
the
gate
Ay
and
let
none
enter
lest
I
break
your
pate
Come
come
Antipholus
we
dine
too
late
Before
the
house
of
Enter
and
Good
Signior
Angelo
you
must
excuse
us
all
My
wife
is
shrewish
when
I
keep
not
hours
Say
that
I
lingerd
with
you
at
your
shop
To
see
the
making
of
her
carcanet
And
that
tomorrow
you
will
bring
it
home
But
heres
a
villain
that
would
face
me
down
He
met
me
on
the
mart
and
that
I
beat
him
And
chargd
him
with
a
thousand
marks
in
gold
And
that
I
did
deny
my
wife
and
house
Thou
drunkard
thou
what
didst
thou
mean
by
this
Say
what
you
will
sir
but
I
know
what
I
know
That
you
beat
me
at
the
mart
I
have
your
hand
to
show
If
the
skin
were
parchment
and
the
blows
you
gave
were
ink
Your
own
handwriting
would
tell
you
what
I
think
I
think
thou
art
an
ass
Marry
so
it
doth
appear
By
the
wrongs
I
suffer
and
the
blows
I
bear
I
should
kick
being
kickd
and
being
at
that
pass
You
would
keep
from
my
heels
and
beware
of
an
ass
Yare
sad
Signior
Balthazar

God

cheer
May
answer

welcome

Signior
Balthazar

at
flesh
or
fish
table

of
welcome

scarce
one
dainty
dish
Good
meat
sir
is
common
that
every
churl
affords
And
welcome
more
common
for
thats
nothing
but
words
Small
cheer
and
great
welcome
makes
a
merry
feast
Ay
to
a
niggardly
host
and
more
sparing
guest
But
though
my
cates
be
mean
take
them
in
good
part
Better

Thou

Enter

What

a
pair
of
stocks

Enter

Within
Who

noise
Within
By

troth

with
unruly
boys
Are

You

come
before
Within
Your
wife
sir
knave
Go
get
you
from

door
If

in
pain
master
this
knave
would
go
sore
Here
is
neither
cheer
sir
nor
welcome
we
would
fain
have
either
In
debating
which
was
best
we
shall
part
with
neither
They
stand
at
the
door
master
bid
them
welcome
hither
There
is
something
in
the
wind
that
we
cannot
get
in
You
would
say
so
master
if
your
garments
were
thin
Your
cake
here
is
warm
within
you
stand
here
in
the
cold
It
would
make
a
man
mad
as
a
buck
to
be
so
bought
and
sold
Go
fetch
me
something
Ill
break
ope
the
gate
Within
Break

Ay

so
Herein

against
your
reputation
And

compass
of
suspect
Th
unviolated
honour
of
your
wife
Once
thisyour
long
experience
of
her
wisdom
Her
sober
virtue
years
and
modesty
Plead
on
her
part
some
cause
to
you
unknown
And
doubt
not
sir
but
she
will
well
excuse
Why
at
this
time
the
doors
are
made
against
you
Be
ruld
by
me
depart
in
patience
And
let
us
to
the
Tiger
all
to
dinner
And
about
evening
come
yourself
alone
To
know
the
reason
of
this
strange
restraint
If
by
strong
hand
you
offer
to
break
in
Now
in
the
stirring
passage
of
the
day
vulgar
comment
will
be
made
of
it
And
that
supposed
by
the
common
rout
Against
your
yet
ungalled
estimation
That
may
with
foul
intrusion
enter
in
And
dwell
upon
your
grave
when
you
are
dead
For
slander
lives
upon
succession
For
ever
housd
where
it
gets
possession
You
have
prevaild
I
will
depart
in
quiet
And
in
despite
of
mirth
mean
to
be
merry
I
know
a
wench
of
excellent
discourse
Pretty
and
witty
wild
and
yet
too
gentle
There
will
we
dine
This
woman
that
I
mean
My
wifebut
I
protest
without
desert
Hath
oftentimes
upbraided
me
withal
To
her
will
we
to
dinner
To
Get
you
home
And
fetch
the
chain
by
this
I
know
tis
made
Bring
it
I
pray
you
to
the
Porpentine
For
theres
the
house
That
chain
will
I
bestow
Be
it
for
nothing
but
to
spite
my
wife
Upon
mine
hostess
there
good
sir
make
haste
Since
mine
own
doors
refuse
to
entertain
me
Ill
knock
elsewhere
to
see
if
theyll
disdain
me
Ill
meet
you
at
that
place
some
hour
hence
Do
so
this
jest
shall
cost
me
some
expense
Ah
Luciana
did
he
tempt
thee
so
Mightst
thou
perceive
austerely
in
his
eye
That
he
did
plead
in
earnest
Yea
or
no
Lookd
he
or
red
or
pale
or
sad
or
merrily
What
observation
madst
thou
in
this
case
Of
his
hearts
meteors
tilting
in
his
face
First
he
denied
you
had
in
him
no
right
He
meant
he
did
me
nonethe
more
my
spite
Then
swore
he
that
he
was
a
stranger
here
And
true
he
swore
though
yet
forsworn
he
were
Then
pleaded
I
for
you
And
what
said
he
That
love
I
beggd
for
you
he
beggd
of
me
With
what
persuasion
did
he
tempt
thy
love
With
words
that
in
an
honest
suit
might
move
First
he
did
praise
my
beauty
then
my
speech
Didst
speak
him
fair
Have
patience
I
beseech
I
cannot
nor
I
will
not
hold
me
still
My
tongue
though
not
my
heart
shall
have
his
will
He
is
deformed
crooked
old
and
sere
Illfacd
worse
bodied
shapeless
everywhere
Vicious
ungentle
foolish
blunt
unkind
Stigmatical
in
making
worse
in
mind
Who
would
be
jealous
then
of
such
a
one
No
evil
lost
is
waild
when
it
is
gone
Ah
but
I
think
him
better
than
I
say
And
yet
would
herein
others
eyes
were
worse
Far
from
her
nest
the
lapwing
cries
away
My
heart
prays
for
him
though
my
tongue
do
curse
Enter
Here
gothe
desk
the
purse
Sweet
now
make
haste
How
hast
thou
lost
thy
breath
By
running
fast
Where
is
thy
master
Dromio
Is
he
well
No
hes
in
Tartar
limbo
worse
than
hell
devil
in
an
everlasting
garment
hath
him
One
whose
hard
heart
is
buttond
up
with
steel
fiend
a
fairy
pitiless
and
rough
wolf
nay
worse
a
fellow
all
in
buff
backfriend
a
shoulderclapper
one
that
countermands
The
passages
of
alleys
creeks
and
narrow
lands
hound
that
runs
counter
and
yet
draws
dryfoot
well
One
that
before
the
Judgment
carries
poor
souls
to
hell
Why
man
what
is
the
matter
I
do
not
know
the
matter
he
is
rested
on
the
case
What
is
he
arrested
Tell
me
at
whose
suit
I
know
not
at
whose
suit
he
is
arrested
well
But
hes
in
a
suit
of
buff
which
rested
him
that
can
I
tell
Will
you
send
him
mistress
redemption
the
money
in
his
desk
Go
fetch
it
sister
Thus
he
unknown
to
me
should
be
in
debt
Tell
me
was
he
arrested
on
a
band
on
a
band
but
on
a
stronger
thing
chain
a
chain
Do
you
not
hear
it
ring
What
the
chain
No
no
the
bell
tis
time
that
I
were
gone
It
was
two
ere
I
left
him
and
now
the
clock
strikes
one
The
hours
come
back
That
did
I
never
hear
yes
If
any
hour
meet
a
sergeant
a
turns
back
for
very
fear
As
if
Time
were
in
debt
How
fondly
dost
thou
reason
Time
is
a
very
bankrupt
and
owes
more
than
hes
worth
to
season
Nay
hes
a
thief
too
have
you
not
heard
men
say
That
Time
comes
stealing
on
by
night
and
day
If
a
be
in
debt
and
theft
and
a
sergeant
in
the
way
Hath
he
not
reason
to
turn
back
an
hour
in
a
day
Reenter
with
a
purse
Go
Dromio
theres
the
money
bear
it
straight
And

thy
master
home
immediately
Come

Conceit

Fear

much
money
To
warrant

I
am
rested
for
My
wife

a
wayward
mood
today
And
will
not
lightly
trust
the
messenger
That
I
should
be
attachd
in
Ephesus
I
tell
you
twill
sound
harshly
in
her
cars
Enter

a
ropesend
Here

Heres

I
warrant
you
will
pay
them

But

Why

I
gave
the
money
for
the
rope
Five
hundred
ducats
villain
for
rope
Ill
serve
you
sir
five
hundred
at
the
rate
To
what
end
did
I
bid
thee
hie

To
a
ropesend
sir
and
to
that
end
am
I
returnd
And
to
that
end
sir
I
will
welcome
you
Beating
him
Good
sir

patient
Nay
tis
for
me
to
be
patient
I
am
in
adversity
Good
now
hold
thy
tongue
Nay
rather
persuade
him
to
hold
his
hands
Thou
whoreson
senseless
villain
I
would
I
were
senseless
sir
that
I
might
not
feel
your
blows
Thou
art
sensible
in
nothing
but
blows
and
so
is
an
ass
I
am
an
ass
indeed
you
may
prove
it
by
my
long
ears
I
have
served
him
from
the
hour
of
my
nativity
to
this
instant
and
have
nothing
at
his
hands
for
my
service
but
blows
When
I
am
cold
he

I

cools
me
with
beating
I
am
wakd
with
it
when
I
sleep
raisd
with
it
when
I
sit
driven
out
of
doors
with
it
when
I
go
from
home
welcomd
home
with
it
when
I
return
nay
I
bear
it
on
my
shoulders
as
beggar
wont

brat
and
I
think
when
he
hath
lamd
me
I
shall
beg
with
it
from

Enter

Come

is
coming
yonder
Mistress
respice
finem
respect
your
end
or
rather
to
prophesy
like
the
parrot
Beware
the
ropesend
Wilt
thou
still
talk
Beating
him
How
say
you
now
Is
not
your
husband
mad
His
incivility
confirms
no
less
Good
Doctor
Pinch
you
are
a
conjurer
Establish
him
in
his
true
sense
again
And
I
will
please
you
what
you
will
demand
Alas
how
fiery
and
how
sharp
he
looks
Mark
how
he
trembles
in
his
ecstasy
Give
me
your
hand
and
let
me
feel
your
pulse
There
is
my
hand
and
let
it
feel
your
ear
Striking
him
I
charge
thee
Satan
housd
within
this
man
To
yield
possession
to
my
holy
prayers
And
to
thy
state
of
darkness
hie
thee
straight
I
conjure
thee
by
all
the
saints
in
heaven
Peace
doting
wizard
peace
I
am
not
mad
that
thou
wert
not
poor
distressed
soul
You
minion
you
are
these
your
customers
Did
this
companion
with
the
saffron
face
Revel
and
feast
it
at
my
house
today
Whilst
upon
me
the
guilty
doors
were
shut
And
I
denied
to
enter
in
my
house
husband
God
doth
know
you
dind
at
home
Where
would
you
had
remaind
until
this
time
Free
from
these
slanders
and
this
open
shame
Dind
at
home
Thou
villain
what
sayest
thou
Sir
Sooth
to
say
you
did
not
dine
at
home
Were
not
my
doors
lockd
up
and
I
shut
out
Perdie
your
doors
were
lockd
and
you
shut
out
And
did
not
she
herself
revile
me
there
Sans
fable
she
herself
revild
you
there
Did
not
her
kitchenmaid
rail
taunt
and
scorn
me
Certes
she
did
the
kitchenvestal
scornd
you
And
did
not
I
in
rage
depart
from
thence
In
verity
you
did
My
bones
bear
witness
That
since
have
felt
the
vigour
of
his
rage
Ist
good
to
soothe
him
in
these
contraries
It
is
no
shame
the
fellow
finds
his
vein
And
yielding
to
him
humours
well
his
frenzy
Thou
hast
subornd
the
goldsmith
to
arrest
me
Alas
I
sent
you
money
to
redeem
you
By
Dromio
here
who
came
in
haste
for
it
Money
by
me
Heart
and
goodwill
you
might
But
surely
master
not
a
rag
of
money
Wentst
not
thou
to
her
for
purse
of
ducats
He
came
to
me
and
I
deliverd
it
And
I
am
witness
with
her
that
she
did
God
and
the
ropemaker
bear
me
witness
That
I
was
sent
for
nothing
but
a
rope
Mistress
both
man
and
master
is
possessd
I
know
it
by
their
pale
and
deadly
looks
They
must
be
bound
and
laid
in
some
dark
room
Say
wherefore
didst
thou
lock
me
forth
today
And
why
dost
thou
deny
the
bag
of
gold
I
did
not
gentle
husband
lock
thee
forth
And
gentle
master
I
receivd
no
gold
But
I
confess
sir
that
we
were
lockd
out
Dissembling
villain
thou
speakst
false
in
both
Dissembling
harlot
thou
art
false
in
all
And
art
confederate
with
a
damned
pack
To
make
a
loathsome
abject
scorn
of
me
But
with
these
nails
Ill
pluck
out
these
false
eyes
That
would
behold
in
me
this
shameful
sport
bind
him
bind
him
let
him
not
come
near
me
More
company
The
fiend
is
strong
within
him
Enter
three
or
four
and
offer
to
bind
him
He
strives
Ay
me
poor
man
how
pale
and
wan
he
looks
What
will
you
murder
me
Thou
gaoler
thou
I
am
thy
prisoner
Wilt
thou
suffer
them
To
make
a
rescue
Masters
let
him
go
He
is
my
prisoner
and
you
shall
not
have
him
Go
bind
this
man
for
he
is
frantic
too
They
bind
What
wilt
thou
do
thou
peevish
officer
Hast
thou
delight
to
see
a
wretched
man
Do
outrage
and
displeasure
to
himself
He
is
my
prisoner
if
I
let
him
go
The
debt
he
owes
will
be
requird
of
me
I
will
discharge
thee
ere
I
go
from
thee
Bear
me
forthwith
unto
his
creditor
And
knowing
how
the
debt
grows
I
will
pay
it
Good
Master
Doctor
see
him
safe
conveyd
Home
to
my
house
most
unhappy
day
most
unhappy
strumpet
Master
I
am
here
entred
in
bond
for
you
Out
on
thee
villian
Wherefore
dost
thou
mad
me
Will
you
be
bound
for
nothing
Be
mad
good
master
cry
The
devil
God
help
poor
souls
how
idly
do
they
talk
Go
bear
him
hence
Sister
go
you
with
me
Say
now
whose
suit
is
he
arrested
at
One
Angelo
a
goldsmith
do
you
know
him
I
know
the
man
What
is
the
sum
he
owes
Two
hundred
ducats
Say
how
grows
it
due
Due
for
a
chain
your
husband
had
of
him
He
did
bespeak
a
chain
for
me
but
had
it
not
When
as
your
husband
all
in
rage
today
Came
to
my
house
and
took
away
my
ring
The
ring
I
saw
upon
his
finger
now
Straight
after
did
I
meet
him
with
a
chain
It
may
be
so
but
I
did
never
see
it
Come
gaoler
bring
me
where
the
goldsmith
is
I
long
to
know
the
truth
hereof
at
large
Enter
with
his
rapier
drawn
and
God
for
thy
mercy
they
are
loose
again
And
come
with
naked
swords
Lets
call
more
help
to
have
them
bound
again
Away
theyll
kill
us
as
fast
as
may
be
frighted
I
see
these
witches
are
afraid
of
swords
She
that
would
be
your
wife
now
ran
from
you
Come
to
the
Centaur
fetch
our
stuff
from
thence
I
long
that
we
were
safe
and
sound
aboard
Faith
stay
here
this
night
they
will
surely
do
us
no
harm
you
saw
they
speak
us
fair
give
us
gold
methinks
they
are
such
a
gentle
nation
that
but
for
the
mountain
of
mad
flesh
that
claims
marriage
of
me
could
find
in
my
heart
to
stay
here
still
and
turn
witch
I
will
not
stay
tonight
for
all
the
town
Therefore
away
to
get
our
stuff
aboard
street
before
a
priory
Enter
and
I
am
sorry
sir
that
I
have
hindred
you
But
I
protest
he
had
the
chain
of
me
Though
most
dishonestly
he
doth
deny
it
How
is
the
man
esteemd
here
in
the
city
Of
very
reverend
reputation
sir
Of
credit
infinite
highly
belovd
Second
to
none
that
lives
here
in
the
city
His
word
might
bear
my
wealth
at
any
time
Speak
softly
yonder
as
I
think
he
walks
Enter
and
Tis
so
and
that
self
chain
about
his
neck
Which
he
forswore
most
monstrously
to
have
Good
sir
draw
near
to
me
Ill
speak
to
him
Signior
Andpholus
I
wonder
much
That
you
would
put
me
to
this
shame
and
trouble
And
not
without
some
scandal
to
yourself
With
circumstance
and
oaths
so
to
deny
This
chain
which
now
you
wear
so
openly
Beside
the
charge
the
shame
imprisonment
You
have
done
wrong
to
this
my
honest
friend
Who
but
for
staying
on
our
controversy
Had
hoisted
sail
and
put
to
sea
today
This
chain
you
had
of
me
can
you
deny
it
I
think
I
had
I
never
did
deny
it
Yes
that
you
did
sir
and
forswore
it
too
Who
heard
me
to
deny
it
or
forswear
it
These
ears
of
mine
thou
knowst
did
hear
thee
Fie
on
thee
wretch
tis
pity
that
thou
livst
To
walk
where
any
honest
men
resort
Thou
art
a
villain
to
impeach
me
thus
Ill
prove
mine
honour
and
mine
honesty
Against
thee
presently
if
thou
darst
stand
I
dare
and
do
defy
thee
for
a
villain
They
draw
Enter
the
and
Hold
hurt
him
not
for
Gods
sake
He
is
mad
Some
get
within
him
take
his
sword
away
Bind
Dromio
too
and
bear
them
to
my
house
Run
master
run
for
Gods
sake
take
a
house
This
is
some
priory
In
or
we
are
spoild
Enter
the
Be
quiet
people
Wherefore
throng
you
hither
To
fetch
my
poor
distracted
husband
hence
Let
us
come
in
that
we
may
bind
him
fast
And
bear
him
home
for
his
recovery
I
knew
he
was
not
in
his
perfect
wits
I
am
sorry
now
that
I
did
draw
on
him
How
long
hath
this
possession
held
the
man
This
week
he
hath
been
heavy
sour
sad
And
much
different
from
the
man
he
was
But
till
this
afternoon
his
passion
Neer
brake
into
extremity
of
rage
Hath
he
not
lost
much
wealth
by
wreck
of
sea
Buried
some
dear
friend
Hath
not
else
his
eye
Strayd
his
affection
in
unlawful
love
sin
prevailing
much
in
youthful
men
Who
give
their
eyes
the
liberty
of
gazing
Which
of
these
sorrows
is
he
subject
to
To
none
of
these
except
it
be
the
last
Namely
some
love
that
drew
him
oft
from
home
You
should
for
that
have
reprehended
him
Why
so
I
did
Ay
but
not
rough
enough
As
roughly
as
my
modesty
would
let
me
Haply
in
private
And
in
assemblies
too
Ay
but
not
enough
It
was
the
copy
of
our
conference
In
bed
he
slept
not
for
my
urging
it
At
board
he
fed
not
for
my
urging
it
Alone
it
was
the
subject
of
my
theme
In
company
I
often
glanced
it
Still
did
I
tell
him
it
was
vile
and
bad
And
thereof
came
it
that
the
man
was
mad
The
venom
clamours
of
a
jealous
woman
Poisons
more
deadly
than
a
mad
dogs
tooth
It
seems
his
sleeps
were
hindred
by
thy
railing
And
thereof
comes
it
that
his
head
is
light
Thou
sayst
his
meat
was
saucd
with
thy
upbraidings
Unquiet
meals
make
ill
digestions
Thereof
the
raging
fire
of
fever
bred
And
whats
a
fever
but
a
fit
of
madness
Thou
sayst
his
sports
were
hindred
by
thy
brawls
Sweet
recreation
barrd
what
doth
ensue
But
moody
and
dull
melancholy
Kinsman
to
grim
and
comfortless
despair
And
at
her
heels
a
huge
infectious
troop
Of
pale
distemperatures
and
foes
to
life
In
food
in
sport
and
lifepreserving
rest
To
be
disturbd
would
mad
or
man
or
beast
The
consequence
is
then
thy
jealous
fits
Hath
scard
thy
husband
from
the
use
of
wits
She
never
reprehended
him
but
mildly
When
he
demeand
himself
rough
rude
and
wildly
Why
bear
you
these
rebukes
and
answer
not
She
did
betray
me
to
my
own
reproof
Good
people
enter
and
lay
hold
on
him
No
not
a
creature
enters
in
my
house
Then
let
your
servants
bring
my
husband
forth
Neither
he
took
this
place
for
sanctuary
And
it
shall
privilege
him
from
your
hands
Till
I
have
brought
him
to
his
wits
again
Or
lose
my
labour
in
assaying
it
I
will
attend
my
husband
be
his
nurse
Diet
his
sickness
for
it
is
my
office
And
will
have
no
attorney
but
myself
And
therefore
let
me
have
him
home
with
me
Be
patient
for
I
will
not
let
him
stir
Till
I
have
usd
the
approved
means
I
have
With
wholesome
syrups
drugs
and
holy
prayers
To
make
of
him
a
formal
man
again
It
is
a
branch
and
parcel
of
mine
oath
charitable
duty
of
my
order
Therefore
depart
and
leave
him
here
with
me
I
will
not
hence
and
leave
my
husband
here
And
ill
it
doth
beseem
your
holiness
To
separate
the
husband
and
the
wife
Be
quiet
and
depart
thou
shalt
not
have
him
Complain
unto
the
Duke
of
this
indignity
Come
go
I
will
fall
prostrate
at
his
feet
And
never
rise
until
my
tears
and
prayers
Have
won
his
Grace
to
come
in
person
hither
And
take
perforce
my
husband
from
the
Abbess
By
this
I
think
the
dial
points
at
five
Anon
Im
sure
the
Duke
himself
in
person
Comes
this
way
to
the
melancholy
vale
The
place
of
death
and
sorry
execution
Behind
the
ditches
of
the
abbey
here
Upon
what
cause
To
see
a
reverend
Syracusian
merchant
Who
put
unluckily
into
this
bay
Against
the
laws
and
statutes
of
this
town
Beheaded
publicly
for
his
offence
See
where
they
come
we
will
behold
his
death
Kneel
to
the
Duke
before
he
pass
the
abbey
Enter
the
attended
bareheaded
with
the
and
other
Yet
once
again
proclaim
it
publicly
If
any
friend
will
pay
the
sum
for
him
He
shall
not
die
so
much
we
tender
him
Justice
most
sacred
Duke
against
the
Abbess
She
is
a
virtuous
and
a
reverend
lady
It
cannot
be
that
she
hath
done
thee
wrong
May
it
please
your
Grace
Antipholus
my
husband
Who
I
made
lord
of
me
and
all
I
had
At
your
important
lettersthis
ill
day
most
outrageous
fit
of
madness
took
him
That
desprately
he
hurried
through
the
street
With
him
his
bondman
all
as
mad
as
he
Doing
displeasure
to
the
citizens
By
rushing
in
their
houses
bearing
thence
Rings
jewels
anything
his
rage
did
like
Once
did
I
get
him
bound
and
sent
him
home
Whilst
to
take
order
for
the
wrongs
I
went
That
here
and
there
his
fury
had
committed
Anon
I
wot
not
by
what
strong
escape
He
broke
from
those
that
had
the
guard
of
him
And
with
his
mad
attendant
and
himself
Each
one
with
ireful
passion
with
drawn
swords
Met
us
again
and
madly
bent
on
us
Chasd
us
away
till
raising
of
more
aid
We
came
again
to
bind
them
Then
they
fled
Into
this
abbey
whither
we
pursud
them
And
here
the
Abbess
shuts
the
gates
on
us
And
will
not
suffer
us
to
fetch
him
out
Nor
send
him
forth
that
we
may
bear
him
hence
Therefore
most
gracious
Duke
with
thy
command
Let
him
be
brought
forth
and
borne
hence
for
help
Long
since
thy
husband
servd
me
in
my
wars
And
I
to
thee
engagd
a
princes
word
When
thou
didst
make
him
master
of
thy
bed
To
do
him
all
the
grace
and
good
I
could
Go
some
of
you
knock
at
the
abbey
gate
And
bid
the
Lady
Abbess
come
to
me
I
will
determine
this
before
I
stir
Enter
a
mistress
mistress
shift
and
save
yourself
My
master
and
his
man
are
both
broke
loose
Beaten
the
maids
arow
and
bound
the
doctor
Whose
beard
they
have
singd
off
with
brands
of
fire
And
ever
as
it
blazd
they
threw
on
him
Great
pails
of
puddled
mire
to
quench
the
hair
My
master
preaches
patience
to
him
and
the
while
His
man
with
scissors
nicks
him
like
a
fool
And
sure
unless
you
send
some
present
help
Between
them
they
will
kill
the
conjurer
Peace
fool
thy
master
and
his
man
are
here
And
that
is
false
thou
dost
report
to
us
Mistress
upon
my
life
I
tell
you
true
I
have
not
breathd
almost
since
I
did
see
it
He
cries
for
you
and
vows
if
he
can
take
you
To
scorch
your
face
and
to
disfigure
you
Cry
within
Hark
hark
I
hear
him
mistress
fly
be
gone
Come
stand
by
me
fear
nothing
Guard
with
halberds
Ay
me
it
is
my
husband
Witness
you
That
he
is
borne
about
invisible
Even
now
we
housd
him
in
the
abbey
here
And
now
hes
there
past
thought
of
human
reason
Enter
and
Justice
most
gracious
Duke
grant
me
justice
Even
for
the
service
that
long
since
I
did
thee
When
I
bestrid
thee
in
the
wars
and
took
Deep
scars
to
save
thy
life
even
for
the
blood
That
then
I
lost
for
thee
now
grant
me
justice
Unless
the
fear
of
death
doth
make
me
dote
I
see
my
son
Antipholus
and
Dromio
Justice
sweet
Prince
against
that
woman
there
She
whom
thou
gavst
to
me
to
be
my
wife
That
hath
abused
and
dishonoured
me
Even
in
the
strength
and
height
of
injury
Beyond
imagination
is
the
wrong
That
she
this
day
hath
shameless
thrown
on
me
Discover
how
and
thou
shalt
find
me
just
This
day
great
Duke
she
shut
the
doors
upon
me
While
she
with
harlots
feasted
in
my
house
grievous
fault
Say
woman
didst
thou
so
No
my
good
lord
Myself
he
and
my
sister
Today
did
dine
together
So
befall
my
soul
As
this
is
false
he
burdens
me
withal
Neer
may
I
look
on
day
nor
sleep
on
night
But
she
tells
to
your
Highness
simple
truth
peflurd
woman
They
are
both
forsworn
In
this
the
madman
justly
chargeth
them
My
liege
I
am
advised
what
I
say
Neither
disturbed
with
the
effect
of
wine
Nor
headyrash
provokd
with
raging
ire
Albeit
my
wrongs
might
make
one
wiser
mad
This
woman
lockd
me
out
this
day
from
dinner
That
goldsmith
there
were
he
not
packd
with
her
Could
witness
it
for
he
was
with
me
then
Who
parted
with
me
to
go
fetch
a
chain
Promising
to
bring
it
to
the
Porpentine
Where
Balthazar
and
I
did
dine
together
Our
dinner
done
and
he
not
coming
thither
I
went
to
seek
him
In
the
street
I
met
him
And
in
his
company
that
gentleman
There
did
this
perjurd
goldsmith
swear
me
down
That
I
this
day
of
him
receivd
the
chain
Which
God
he
knows
I
saw
not
for
the
which
He
did
arrest
me
with
an
officer
I
did
obey
and
sent
my
peasant
home
For
certain
ducats
he
with
none
returnd
Then
fairly
I
bespoke
the
officer
To
go
in
person
with
me
to
my
house
By
th
way
we
met
my
wife
her
sister
and
a
rabble
more
Of
vile
confederates
Along
with
them
They
brought
one
Pinch
a
hungry
leanfacd
villain
mere
anatomy
a
mountebank
threadbare
juggler
and
a
fortuneteller
needy
holloweyd
sharplooking
wretch
living
dead
man
This
pernicious
slave
Forsooth
took
on
him
as
a
conjurer
And
gazing
in
mine
eyes
feeling
my
pulse
And
with
no
face
as
twere
outfacing
me
Cries
out
I
was
possessd
Then
all
together
They
fell
upon
me
bound
me
bore
me
thence
And
in
a
dark
and
dankish
vault
at
home
There
left
me
and
my
man
both
bound
together
Till
gnawing
with
my
teeth
my
bonds
in
sunder
I
gaind
my
freedom
and
immediately
Ran
hither
to
your
Grace
whom
I
beseech
To
give
me
ample
satisfaction
For
these
deep
shames
and
great
indignities
My
lord
in
truth
thus
far
I
witness
with
him
That
he
dind
not
at
home
but
was
lockd
out
But
had
he
such
a
chain
of
thee
or
no
He
had
my
lord
and
when
he
ran
in
here
These
people
saw
the
chain
about
his
neck
Besides
I
will
be
sworn
these
ears
of
mine
Heard
you
confess
you
had
the
chain
of
him
After
you
first
forswore
it
on
the
mart
And
thereupon
I
drew
my
sword
on
you
And
then
you
fled
into
this
abbey
here
From
whence
I
think
you
are
come
by
miracle
I
never
came
within
these
abbey
walls
Nor
ever
didst
thou
draw
thy
sword
on
me
I
never
saw
the
chain
so
help
me
Heaven
And
this
is
false
you
burden
me
withal
Why
what
an
intricate
impeach
is
this
I
think
you
all
have
drunk
of
Circes
cup
If
here
you
housd
him
here
he
would
have
been
If
he
were
mad
he
would
not
plead
so
coldly
You
say
he
dind
at
home
the
goldsmith
here
Denies
that
saying
Sirrah
what
say
you
Sir
he
dind
with
her
there
at
the
Porpentine
He
did
and
from
my
finger
snatchd
that
ring
Tis
true
my
liege
this
ring
I
had
of
her
Sawst
thou
him
enter
at
the
abbey
here
As
sure
my
liege
as
I
do
see
your
Grace
Why
this
is
strange
Go
call
the
Abbess
hither
I
think
you
are
all
mated
or
stark
mad
Most
mighty
Duke
vouchsafe
me
speak
a
word
Haply
I
see
a
friend
will
save
my
life
And
pay
the
sum
that
may
deliver
me
Speak
freely
Syracusian
what
thou
wilt
Is
not
your
name
sir
calld
Antipholus
And
is
not
that
your
bondman
Dromio
Within
this
hour
I
was
his
bondman
sir
But
he
I
thank
him
gnawd
in
two
my
cords
Now
am
I
Dromio
and
his
man
unbound
I
am
sure
you
both
of
you
remember
me
Ourselves
we
do
remember
sir
by
you
For
lately
we
were
bound
as
you
are
now
You
are
not
Pinchs
patient
are
you
sir
Why
look
you
strange
on
me
You
know
me
well
I
never
saw
you
in
my
life
till
now
grief
hath
changd
me
since
you
saw
me
last
And
careful
hours
with
times
deformed
hand
Have
written
strange
defeatures
in
my
face
But
tell
me
yet
dost
thou
not
know
my
voice
Neither
Dromio
nor
thou
No
trust
me
sir
nor
I
I
am
sure
thou
dost
Ay
sir
but
I
am
sure
I
do
not
and
whatsoever
a
man
denies
you
are
now
bound
to
believe
him
Not
know
my
voice
times
extremity
Hast
thou
so
crackd
and
splitted
my
poor
tongue
In
seven
short
years
that
here
my
only
son
Knows
not
my
feeble
key
of
untund
cares
Though
now
this
grained
face
of
mine
be
hid
In
sapconsuming
winters
drizzled
snow
And
all
the
conduits
of
my
blood
froze
up
Yet
hath
my
night
of
life
some
memory
My
wasting
lamps
some
fading
glimmer
left
My
dull
deaf
ears
a
little
use
to
hear
All
these
old
witnessesI
cannot
err
Tell
me
thou
art
my
son
Antipholus
I
never
saw
my
father
in
my
life
But
seven
years
since
in
Syracuse
boy
Thou
knowst
we
parted
but
perhaps
my
son
Thou
shamst
to
acknowledge
me
in
misery
The
Duke
and
all
that
know
me
in
the
city
Can
witness
with
me
that
it
is
not
so
I
neer
saw
Syracuse
in
my
life
I
tell
thee
Syracusian
twenty
years
Have
I
been
patron
to
Antipholus
During
which
time
he
neer
saw
Syracuse
I
see
thy
age
and
dangers
make
thee
dote
Reenter
the
with
and
Most
mighty
Duke
behold
a
man
much
wrongd
All
gather
to
see
them
I
see
two
husbands
or
mine
eyes
deceive
me
One
of
these
men
is
genius
to
the
other
And
so
of
these
Which
is
the
natural
man
And
which
the
spirit
Who
deciphers
them
I
sir
am
Dromio
command
him
away
I
Sir
am
Dromio
pray
let
me
stay
Aegeon
art
thou
not
or
else
his
my
old
master
who
hath
bound
Whoever
bound
him
I
will
loose
his
bonds
And
gain
a
husband
by
his
liberty
Speak
old
Aegeon
if
thou
best
the
man
That
hadst
a
wife
once
calld
Aemilia
That
bore
thee
at
a
burden
two
fair
sons
if
thou
best
the
same
Aegeon
speak
And
speak
unto
the
same
Aemilia
If
I
dream
not
thou
art
Aemilia
If
thou
art
she
tell
me
where
is
that
son
That
floated
with
thee
on
the
fatal
raft
By
men
of
Epidamnum
he
and
I
And
the
twin
Dromio
all
were
taken
up
But
by
and
by
rude
fishermen
of
Corinth
By
force
took
Dromio
and
my
son
from
them
And
me
they
left
with
those
of
Epidamnum
What
then
became
of
them
I
cannot
tell
I
to
this
fortune
that
you
see
me
in
Why
here
begins
his
morning
story
right
These
two
Antipholus
these
two
so
like
And
these
two
Dromios
one
in
semblance
Besides
her
urging
of
her
wreck
at
sea
These
are
the
parents
to
these
children
Which
accidentally
are
met
together
Antipholus
thou
camst
from
Corinth
first
No
sir
not
I
I
came
from
Syracuse
Stay
stand
apart
I
know
not
which
is
which
I
came
from
Corinth
my
most
gracious
lord
And
I
with
him
Brought
to
this
town
by
that
most
famous
warrior
Duke
Menaphon
your
most
renowned
uncle
Which
of
you
two
did
dine
with
me
today
I
gentle
mistress
And
are
not
you
my
husband
No
I
say
nay
to
that
And
so
do
I
yet
did
she
call
me
so
And
this
fair
gentlewoman
her
sister
here
Did
call
me
brother
To
What
I
told
you
then
I
hope
I
shall
have
leisure
to
make
good
If
this
be
not
a
dream
I
see
and
hear
That
is
the
chain
sir
which
you
had
of
me
I
think
it
be
sir
I
deny
it
not
And
you
sir
for
this
chain
arrested
me
I
think
I
did
sir
I
deny
it
not
I
sent
you
money
sir
to
be
your
bail
By
Dromio
but
I
think
he
brought
it
not
No
none
by
me
This
purse
of
ducats
I
receivd
from
you
And
Dromio
my
man
did
bring
them
me
I
see
we
still
did
meet
each
others
man
And
I
was
taen
for
him
and
he
for
me
And
thereupon
these
are
arose
These
ducats
pawn
I
for
my
father
here
It
shall
not
need
thy
father
hath
his
life
Sir
I
must
have
that
diamond
from
you
There
take
it
and
much
thanks
for
my
good
cheer
Renowned
Duke
vouchsafe
to
take
the
pains
To
go
with
us
into
the
abbey
here
And

large
discoursed
all
our
fortunes
And

place
That

this
sympathized
one

Have
sufferd
wrong

And
we
shall
make
full
satisfaction
Thirtythree
years

travail
Of

sons
and
till
this
present
hour
My
heavy
burden

The

husband
and

children

And

calendars
of
their

After

With

this
feast

Master

stuff

stuff

embarkd
Your
goods

in
the
Centaur
He

me
I

your
master
Dromio
Come

to
that
anon
Embrace

brother

There

a
fat
friend
at
your
masters
house
That
kitchend
me
for
you
today
at
dinner
She
now
shall
be
my
sister
not
my
wife
Methinks
you
are
my
glass
and
not
my
brother
I
see
by
you
I
am
a
sweetfacd
youth
Will
you
walk
in
to
see
their
gossiping
Not
I
sir
you
are
my
elder
Thats
a
question
how
shall
we
try
it
Well
draw
cuts
for
the
senior
till
then
lead
thou
first
Nay
then
thus
We
came
into
the
world
like
brother
and
brother
And
now
lets
go
hand
in
hand
not
one
before
another
I
I
Rome
street
Enter
a
company
of
mutinous
citizens
with
staves
clubs
and
other
weapons
Before
we
proceed
any
further
hear
me
speak
Speak
speak
are
all
resolvd
rather
to
die
than
to
famish
Resolvd
resolvd
First
you
know
Caius
Marcius
is
chief
enemy
to
the
people
We
knowt
we
knowt
Let
us
kill
him
and
well
have
corn
at
our
own
price
Ist
a
verdict
No
more
talking
ont
let
it
be
done
Away
away
One
word
good
citizens
We
are
accounted
poor
citizens
the
patricians
good
What
authority
surfeits
on
would
relieve
us
if
they
would
yield
us
but
the
superfluity
while
it
were
wholesome
we
might
guess
they
relieved
us
humanely
but
they
think
we
are
too
dear
The
leanness
that
afflicts
us
the
object
of
our
misery
is
as
an
inventory
to
particularize
their
abundance
our
sufferance
is
a
gain
to
them
Let
us
revenge
this
with
our
pikes
ere
we
become
rakes
for
the
gods
know
I
speak
this
in
hunger
for
bread
not
in
thirst
for
revenge
Would
you
proceed
especially
against
Caius
Marcius
Against
him
first
hes
a
very
dog
to
the
commonalty
Consider
you
what
services
he
has
done
for
his
country
Very
well
and
could
be
content
to
give
him
good
report
fort
but
that
he
pays
himself
with
being
proud
Nay
but
speak
not
maliciously
I
say
unto
you
what
he
hath
done
famously
he
did
it
to
that
end
though
softconsciencd
men
can
be
content
to
say
it
was
for
his
country
he
did
it
to
please
his
mother
and
to
be
partly
proud
which
he
is
even
to
the
altitude
of
his
virtue
What
he
cannot
help
in
his
nature
you
account
a
vice
in
him
You
must
in
no
way
say
he
is
covetous
If
I
must
not
I
need
not
be
barren
of
accusations
he
hath
faults
with
surplus
to
tire
in
repetition
Shouts
within
What
shouts
are
these
The
other
side
o
th
city
is
risen
Why
stay
we
prating
here
To
th
Capitol
Come
come
Soft
who
comes
here
Enter
Worthy
Menenius
Agrippa
one
that
hath
always
lovd
the
people
Hes
one
honest
enough
would
all
the
rest
were
so
What
works
my
countrymen
in
hand
Where
go
you
With
bats
and
clubs
The
matter
Speak
I
pray
you
Our
business
is
not
unknown
to
th
Senate
they
have
had
inkling
this
fortnight
what
we
intend
to
do
which
now
well
show
em
in
deeds
They
say
poor
suitors
have
strong
breaths
they
shall
know
we
have
strong
arms
too
Why
masters
my
good
friends
mine
honest
neighbours
Will
you
undo
yourselves
We
cannot
sir
we
are
undone
already
I
tell
you
friends
most
charitable
care
Have
the
patricians
of
you
For
your
wants
Your
suffering
in
this
dearth
you
may
as
well
Strike
at
the
heaven
with
your
staves
as
lift
them
Against
the
Roman
state
whose
course
will
on
The
way
it
takes
cracking
ten
thousand
curbs
Of
more
strong
link
asunder
than
can
ever
Appear
in
your
impediment
For
the
dearth
The
gods
not
the
patricians
make
it
and
Your
knees
to
them
not
arms
must
help
Alack
You
are
transported
by
calamity
Thither
where
more
attends
you
and
you
slander
The
helms
o
th
state
who
care
for
you
like
fathers
When
you
curse
them
as
enemies
Care
for
us
True
indeed
They
neer
card
for
us
yet
Suffer
us
to
famish
and
their
storehouses
crammd
with
grain
make
edicts
for
usury
to
support
usurers
repeal
daily
any
wholesome
act
established
against
the
rich
and
provide
more
piercing
statutes
daily
to
chain
up
and
restrain
the
poor
If
the
wars
eat
us
not
up
they
will
and
theres
all
the
love
they
bear
us
Either
you
must
Confess
yourselves
wondrous
malicious
Or
be
accusd
of
folly
I
shall
tell
you
pretty
tale
It
may
be
you
have
heard
it
But
since
it
serves
my
purpose
I
will
venture
To
stalet
a
little
more
Well
Ill
hear
it
sir
yet
you
must
not
think
to
fob
off
our
disgrace
with
a
tale
But
ant
please
you
deliver
There
was
a
time
when
all
the
bodys
members
Rebelld
against
the
belly
thus
accusd
it
That
only
like
a
gulf
it
did
remain
I
th
midst
o
th
body
idle
and
unactive
Still
cupboarding
the
viand
never
bearing
Like
labour
with
the
rest
where
th
other
instruments
Did
see
and
hear
devise
instruct
walk
feel
And
mutually
participate
did
minister
Unto
the
appetite
and
affection
common
Of
the
whole
body
The
belly
answerd
Well
sir
what
answer
made
the
belly
Sir
I
shall
tell
you
With
a
kind
of
smile
Which
neer
came
from
the
lungs
but
even
thus
For
look
you
I
may
make
the
belly
smile
As
well
as
speak
it
tauntingly
replied
To
th
discontented
members
the
mutinous
parts
That
envied
his
receipt
even
so
most
fitly
As
you
malign
our
senators
for
that
They
are
not
such
as
you
Your
bellys
answer
What
The
kingly
crowned
head
the
vigilant
eye
The
counsellor
heart
the
arm
our
soldier
Our
steed
the
leg
the
tongue
our
trumpeter
With
other
muniments
and
petty
helps
Is
this
our
fabric
if
that
they
What
then
Fore
me
this
fellow
speaks
What
then
What
then
Should
by
the
cormorant
belly
be
restraind
Who
is
the
sink
o
th
body
Well
what
then
The
former
agents
if
they
did
complain
What
could
the
belly
answer
I
will
tell
you
If
youll
bestow
a
small
of
what
you
have
little
Patience
awhile
youst
hear
the
bellys
answer
Yare
long
about
it
Note
me
this
good
friend
Your
most
grave
belly
was
deliberate
Not
rash
like
his
accusers
and
thus
answered
True
is
it
my
incorporate
friends
quoth
he
That
I
receive
the
general
food
at
first
Which
you
do
live
upon
and
fit
it
is
Because
I
am
the
storehouse
and
the
shop
Of
the
whole
body
But
if
you
do
remember
I
send
it
through
the
rivers
of
your
blood
Even
to
the
court
the
heart
to
th
seat
o
th
brain
And
through
the
cranks
and
offices
of
man
The
strongest
nerves
and
small
inferior
veins
From
me
receive
that
natural
competency
Whereby
they
live
And
though
that
all
at
once
You
my
good
friends
this
says
the
belly
mark
me
Ay
sir
well
well
Though
all
at
once
cannot
See
what
I
do
deliver
out
to
each
Yet
I
can
make
my
audit
up
that
all
From
me
do
back
receive
the
flour
of
all
And
leave
me
but
the
bran
What
say
you
to
t
It
was
an
answer
How
apply
you
this
The
senators
of
Rome
are
this
good
belly
And
you
the
mutinous
members
for
examine
Their
counsels
and
their
cares
digest
things
rightly
Touching
the
weal
o
th
common
you
shall
find
No
public
benefit
which
you
receive
But
it
proceeds
or
comes
from
them
to
you
And
no
way
from
yourselves
What
do
you
think
You
the
great
toe
of
this
assembly
I
the
great
toe
Why
the
great
toe
For
that
being
one
o
th
lowest
basest
poorest
Of
this
most
wise
rebellion
thou
goest
foremost
Thou
rascal
that
art
worst
in
blood
to
run
Leadst
first
to
win
some
vantage
But
make
you
ready
your
stiff
bats
and
clubs
Rome
and
her
rats
are
at
the
point
of
battle
The
one
side
must
have
bale
Enter
Hail
noble
Marcius
Thanks
Whats
the
matter
you
dissentious
rogues
That
rubbing
the
poor
itch
of
your
opinion
Make
yourselves
scabs
We
have
ever
your
good
word
He
that
will
give
good
words
to
thee
will
flatter
Beneath
abhorring
What
would
you
have
you
curs
That
like
nor
peace
nor
war
The
one
affrights
you
The
other
makes
you
proud
He
that
trusts
to
you
Where
he
should
find
you
lions
finds
you
hares
Where
foxes
geese
you
are
no
surer
no
Than
is
the
coal
of
fire
upon
the
ice
Or
hailstone
in
the
sun
Your
virtue
is
To
make
him
worthy
whose
offence
subdues
him
And
curse
that
justice
did
it
Who
deserves
greatness
Deserves
your
hate
and
your
affections
are
sick
mans
appetite
who
desires
most
that
Which
would
increase
his
evil
He
that
depends
Upon
your
favours
swims
with
fins
of
lead
And
hews
down
oaks
with
rushes
Hang
ye
Trust
ye
With
every
minute
you
do
change
a
mind
And
call
him
noble
that
was
now
your
hate
Him
vile
that
was
your
garland
Whats
the
matter
That
in
these
several
places
of
the
city
You
cry
against
the
noble
Senate
who
Under
the
gods
keep
you
in
awe
which
else
Would
feed
on
one
another
Whats
their
seeking
For
corn
at
their
own
rates
whereof
they
say
The
city
is
well
stord
Hang
em
They
say
Theyll
sit
by
th
fire
and
presume
to
know
Whats
done
i
th
Capitol
whos
like
to
rise
Who
thrives
and
who
declines
side
factions
and
give
out
Conjectural
marriages
making
parties
strong
And
feebling
such
as
stand
not
in
their
liking
Below
their
cobbled
shoes
They
say
theres
grain
enough
Would
the
nobility
lay
aside
their
ruth
And
let
me
use
my
sword
Id
make
a
quarry
With
thousands
of
these
quarterd
slaves
as
high
As
I
could
pick
my
lance
Nay
these
are
almost
thoroughly
persuaded
For
though
abundantly
they
lack
discretion
Yet
are
they
passing
cowardly
But
I
beseech
you
What
says
the
other
troop
They
are
dissolvd
Hang
em
They
said
they
were
anhungry
sighd
forth
proverbs
That
hunger
broke
stone
walls
that
dogs
must
eat
That
meat
was
made
for
mouths
that
the
gods
sent
not
Corn
for
the
rich
men
only
With
these
shreds
They
vented
their
complainings
which
being
answerd
And
a
petition
granted
them
a
strange
one
To
break
the
heart
of
generosity
And
make
bold
power
look
pale
they
threw
their
caps
As
they
would
hang
them
on
the
horns
o
th
moon
Shouting
their
emulation
What
is
granted
them
Five
tribunes
to
defend
their
vulgar
wisdoms
Of
their
own
choice
Ones
Junius
Brutus
Sicinius
Velutus
and
I
know
not
Sdeath
The
rabble
should
have
first
unroofd
the
city
Ere
so
prevaild
with
me
it
will
in
time
Win
upon
power
and
throw
forth
greater
themes
For
insurrections
arguing
This
is
strange
Go
get
you
home
you
fragments
Enter
a
hastily
Wheres
Caius
Marcius
Here
Whats
the
matter
The
news
is
sir
the
Volsces
are
in
arms
I
am
glad
ont
then
we
shall
ha
means
to
vent
Our
musty
superfluity
See
our
best
elders
Enter
with
other
and
Marcius
tis
true
that
you
have
lately
told
us
The
Volsces
are
in
arms
They
have
a
leader
Tullus
Aufidius
that
will
put
you
tot
I
sin
in
envying
his
nobility
And
were
I
anything
but
what
I
am
I
would
wish
me
only
he
You
have
fought
together
Were
half
to
half
the
world
by
th
ears
and
he
Upon
my
party
Id
revolt
to
make
Only
my
wars
with
him
He
is
a
lion
That
I
am
proud
to
hunt
Then
worthy
Marcius
Attend
upon
Cominius
to
these
wars
It
is
your
former
promise
Sir
it
is
And
I
am
constant
Titus
Lartius
thou
Shalt
see
me
once
more
strike
at
Tullus
face
What
art
thou
stiff
Standst
out
No
Caius
Marcius
Ill
lean
upon
one
crutch
and
fight
with
tother
Ere
stay
behind
this
business
true
bred
Your
company
to
th
Capitol
where
I
know
Our
greatest
friends
attend
us
To
Lead
you
on
To
Follow
Cominius
we
must
follow
you
Right
worthy
you
priority
Noble
Marcius
To
the
Citizens
Hence
to
your
homes
be
gone
Nay
let
them
follow
The
Volsces
have
much
corn
take
these
rats
thither
To
gnaw
their
garners
Worshipful
mutineers
Your
valour
puts
well
forth
pray
follow
Ciitzens
steal
away
Was
ever
man
so
proud
as
is
this
Marcius
He
has
no
equal
When
we
were
chosen
tribunes
for
the
people
Markd
you
his
lip
and
eyes
Nay
but
his
taunts
Being
movd
he
will
not
spare
to
gird
the
gods
Bemock
the
modest
moon
The
present
wars
devour
him
He
is
grown
Too
proud
to
be
so
valiant
Such
a
nature
Tickled
with
good
success
disdains
the
shadow
Which
he
treads
on
at
noon
But
I
do
wonder
His
insolence
can
brook
to
be
commanded
Under
Cominius
Fame
at
the
which
he
aims
In
whom
already
he
is
well
gracd
cannot
Better
be
held
nor
more
attaind
than
by
place
below
the
first
for
what
miscarries
Shall
be
the
generals
fault
though
he
perform
To
th
utmost
of
a
man
and
giddy
censure
Will
then
cry
out
of
Marcius
if
he
Had
borne
the
business
Besides
if
things
go
well
Opinion
that
so
sticks
on
Marcius
shall
Of
his
demerits
rob
Cominius
Come
Half
all
Cominius
honours
are
to
Marcius
Though
Marcius
earnd
them
not
and
all
his
faults
To
Marcius
shall
be
honours
though
indeed
In
aught
he
merit
not
Lets
hence
and
hear
How
the
dispatch
is
made
and
in
what
fashion
More
than
his
singularity
he
goes
Upon
this
present
action
Lets
along
I
pray
you
daughter
sing
or
express
yourself
in
a
more
comfortable
sort
If
my
son
were
my
husband
I
should
freelier
rejoice
in
that
absence
wherein
he
won
honour
than
in
the
embracements
of
his
bed
where
he
would
show
most
love
When
yet
he
was
but
tenderbodied
and
the
only
son
of
my
womb
when
youth
with
comeliness
pluckd
all
gaze
his
way
when
for
a
day
of
kings
entreaties
a
mother
should
not
sell
him
an
hour
from
her
beholding
I
considering
how
honour
would
become
such
a
person
that
it
was
no
better
than
picturelike
to
hang
by
th
wall
if
renown
made
it
not
stir
was
pleasd
to
let
him
seek
danger
where
he
was
to
find
fame
To
a
cruel
war
I
sent
him
from
whence
he
returnd
his
brows
bound
with
oak
I
tell
thee
daughter
I
sprang
not
more
in
joy
at
first
hearing
he
was
a
manchild
than
now
in
first
seeing
he
had
proved
himself
a
man
But
had
he
died
in
the
business
madam
how
then
Then
his
good
report
should
have
been
my
son
I
therein
would
have
found
issue
Hear
me
profess
sincerely
had
I
a
dozen
sons
each
in
my
love
alike
and
none
less
dear
than
thine
and
my
good
Marcius
I
had
rather
had
eleven
die
nobly
for
their
country
than
one
voluptuously
surfeit
out
of
action
Enter
a
Madam
the
Lady
Valeria
is
come
to
visit
you
Beseech
you
give
me
leave
to
retire
myself
Indeed
you
shall
not
Methinks
I
hear
hither
your
husbands
drum
See
him
pluck
Aufidius
down
by
th
hair
As
children
from
a
bear
the
Volsces
shunning
him
Methinks
I
see
him
stamp
thus
and
call
thus
Come
on
you
cowards
You
were
got
in
fear
Though
you
were
born
in
Rome
His
bloody
brow
With
his
maild
hand
then
wiping
forth
he
goes
Like
to
a
harvestman
thats
taskd
to
mow
Or
all
or
lose
his
hire
His
bloody
brow
Jupiter
no
blood
Away
you
fool
It
more
becomes
a
man
Than
gilt
his
trophy
The
breasts
of
Hecuba
When
she
did
suckle
Hector
lookd
not
lovelier
Than
Hectors
forehead
when
it
spit
forth
blood
At
Grecian
sword
contemning
Tell
Valeria
We
are
fit
to
bid
her
welcome
Heavens
bless
my
lord
from
fell
Aufidius
Hell
beat
Aufidius
head
below
his
knee
And
tread
upon
his
neck
Reenter
With
and
an
usher
My
ladies

Sweet

You

sewing
here
fine
spot
in
good
faith
How
does
your
little
son
I
thank
your
ladyship
well
good
madam
He
had
rather
see
the
swords
and
hear
a
drum
than
look
upon
his
schoolmaster
my
word
the
fathers
son
Ill
swear
tis
a
very
pretty
boy
my
troth
I
lookd
upon
him
a
Wednesday
half
an
hour
together
has
such
a
confirmd
countenance
I
saw
him
run
after
a
gilded
butterfly
and
when
he
caught
it
he
let
it
go
again
and
after
it
again
and
over
and
over
he
comes
and
up
again
catchd
it
again
or
whether
his
fall
enragd
him
or
how
twas
he
did
so
set
his
teeth
and
tear
it
I
warrant
how
he
mammockd
it
One
ons
fathers
moods
Indeed
la
tis
a
noble
child
crack
madam
Come
lay
aside
your
stitchery
I
must
have
you

the
idle
huswife
with
me
this
afternoon
No
good
madam
I
will
not
out
of
doors
Not
out
of
doors
She
shall
she
shall
Indeed
no
by
your
patience
Ill
not
over
the
threshold
till
my
lord
return
from
the
wars
Fie
you
confine
yourself
most
unreasonably
come
you
must
go
visit
the
good
lady
that
lies
in
I
will
wish
her
speedy
strength
and
visit
her
with
my
prayers
but
I
cannot
go
thither
Why
I
pray
you
Tis
not
to
save
labour
nor
that
I
want
love
You
would
be
another
Penelope
yet
they
say
all
the
yarn
she
spun
in
Ulysses
absence
did
but
fill
Ithaca
full
of
moths
Come
I
would
your
cambric
were
sensible
as
your
finger
that
you
might
leave
pricking
it
for
pity
Come
you
shall
go
with
us
No
good
madam
pardon
me
indeed
I
will
not
forth
In
truth
la
go
with
me
and
Ill
tell
you
excellent
news
of
your
husband
good
madam
there
can
be
none
yet
Verily
I
do
not
jest
with
you
there
came
news
from
him
last
night
Indeed
madam
In
earnest
its
true
I
heard
a
senator
speak
it
Thus
it
is
the
Volsces
have
an
army
forth
against
whom
Cominius
the
general
is
gone
with
one
part
of
our
Roman
power
Your
lord
and
Titus
Lartius
are
set
down
before
their
city
Corioli
they
nothing
doubt
prevailing
and
to
make
it
brief
wars
This
is
true
on
mine
honour
and
so
I
pray
go
with
us
Give
me
excuse
good
madam
I
will
obey
you
in
everything
hereafter
Let
her
alone
lady
as
she
is
now
she
will
but
disease
our
better
mirth
In
troth
I
think
she
would
Fare
you
well
then
Come
good
sweet
lady
Prithee
Virgilia
turn
thy
solemness
out
o
door
and
go
along
with
us
No
at
a
word
madam
indeed
I
must
not
I
wish
you
much
mirth
Well
then
farewell
This
will
I
carry
to
Rome
And
I
this
murrain
on
t
I
took
this
for
silver
Alarum
continues
still
afar
off
Enter
and
With
a
trumpeter
See
here
these
movers
that
do
prize
their
hours
At
a
crackd
drachma
Cushions
leaden
spoons
Irons
of
a
doit
doublets
that
hangmen
would
Bury
with
those
that
wore
them
these
base
slaves
Ere
yet
the
fight
be
done
pack
up
Down
with
them
And
hark
what
noise
the
general
makes
To
him
There
is
the
man
of
my
souls
hate
Aufidius
Piercing
our
Romans
then
valiant
Titus
take
Convenient
numbers
to
make
good
the
city
Whilst
I
with
those
that
have
the
spirit
will
haste
To
help
Cominius
Worthy
sir
thou
bleedst
Thy
exercise
hath
been
too
violent
For
a
second
course
of
fight
Sir
praise
me
not
My
work
hath
yet
not
warmd
me
Fare
you
well
The
blood
I
drop
is
rather
physical
Than
dangerous
to
me
To
Aufidius
thus
I
will
appear
and
fight
Now
the
fair
goddess
Fortune
Fall
deep
in
love
with
thee
and
her
great
charms
Misguide
thy
opposers
swords
Bold
gentleman
Prosperity
be
thy
page
Thy
friend
no
less
Than
those
she
placeth
highest
So
farewell
Thou
worthiest
Marcius
Go
sound
thy
trumpet
in
the
marketplace
Call
thither
all
the
officers
o
th
town
Where
they
shall
know
our
mind
Away
having
set
a
guard
upon
Corioli
going
with
drum
and
trumpet
toward
and
enters
with
a
other
soldiers
and
a
scout
So
let
the
ports
be
guarded
keep
your
duties
As
I
have
set
them
down
If
I
do
send
dispatch
Those
centuries
to
our
aid
the
rest
will
serve
For
a
short
holding
If
we
lose
the
field
We
cannot
keep
the
town
Fear
not
our
care
sir
Hence
and
shut
your
gates
upons
Our
guider
come
to
th
Roman
camp
conduct
us
with
the
Romans
at
another
door
with
his
arm
in
a
scarf
If
I
should
tell
thee
oer
this
thy
days
work
Thout
not
believe
thy
deeds
but
Ill
report
it
Where
senators
shall
mingle
tears
with
smiles
Where
great
patricians
shall
attend
and
shrug
I
th
end
admire
where
ladies
shall
be
frighted
And
gladly
quakd
hear
more
where
the
dull
tribunes
That
with
the
fusty
plebeians
hate
thine
honours
Shall
say
against
their
hearts
We
thank
the
gods
Our
Rome
hath
such
a
soldier
Yet
camst
thou
to
a
morsel
of
this
feast
Having
fully
dind
before
Enter
with
his
power
from
the
pursuit
General
Here
is
the
steed
we
the
caparison
Hadst
thou
beheld
Pray
now
no
more
my
mother
Who
has
a
charter
to
extol
her
blood
When
she
does
praise
me
grieves
me
I
have
done
As
you
have
done
thats
what
I
can
inducd
As
you
have
been
thats
for
my
country
He
that
has
but
effected
his
good
will
Hath
overtaen
mine
act
You
shall
not
be
The
grave
of
your
deserving
Rome
must
know
The
value
of
her
own
Twere
a
concealment
Worse
than
a
theft
no
less
than
a
traducement
To
hide
your
doings
and
to
silence
that
Which
to
the
spire
and
top
of
praises
vouchd
Would
seem
but
modest
Therefore
I
beseech
you
In
sign
of
what
you
are
not
to
reward
What
you
have
done
before
our
army
hear
me
I
have
some
wounds
upon
me
and
they
smart
To
hear
themselves
remembred
Should
they
not
Well
might
they
fester
gainst
ingratitude
And
tent
themselves
with
death
Of
all
the
horses
Whereof
we
have
taen
good
and
good
store
of
all
The
treasure
in
this
field
achievd
and
city
We
render
you
the
tenth
to
be
taen
forth
Before
the
common
distribution
at
Your
only
choice
I
thank
you
General
But
cannot
make
my
heart
consent
to
take
bribe
to
pay
my
sword
I
do
refuse
it
And
stand
upon
my
common
part
with
those
That
have
beheld
the
doing
long
flourish
They
all
cry
Marcius
Marcius
cast
up
their
caps
and
lances
and
stand
bare
May
these
same
instruments
which
you
profane
Never
sound
more
When
drums
and
trumpets
shall
I
th
field
prove
flatterers
let
courts
and
cities
be
Made
all
of
falsefacd
soothing
When
steel
grows
Soft
as
the
parasites
silk
let
him
be
made
An
overture
for
th
wars
No
more
I
say
For
that
I
have
not
washd
my
nose
that
bled
Or
foild
some
debile
wretch
which
without
note
Heres
many
else
have
done
you
shout
me
forth
In
acclamations
hyperbolical
As
if
I
lovd
my
little
should
be
dieted
In
praises
saucd
with
lies
Too
modest
are
you
More
cruel
to
your
good
report
than
grateful
To
us
that
give
you
truly
By
your
patience
If
gainst
yourself
you
be
incensd
well
put
you
Like
one
that
means
his
proper
harm
in
manacles
Then
reason
safely
with
you
Therefore
be
it
known
As
to
us
to
all
the
world
that
Caius
Marcius
Wears
this
wars
garland
in
token
of
the
which
My
noble
steed
known
to
the
camp
I
give
him
With
all
his
trim
belonging
and
from
this
time
For
what
he
did
before
Corioli
can
him
With
all
th
applauseand
clamour
of
the
host
Caius
Marcius
Coriolanus
Bear
th
addition
nobly
ever
Flourish
Trumpets
sound
and
drums
Caius
Marcius
Coriolanus
I
will
go
wash
And
when
my
face
is
fair
you
shall
perceive
Whether
I
blush
or
no
Howbeit
I
thank
you
I
mean
to
stride
your
steed
and
at
all
times
To
undercrest
your
good
addition
To
th
fairness
of
my
power
So
to
our
tent
Where
ere
we
do
repose
us
we
will
write
To
Rome
of
our
success
You
Titus
Lartius
Must
to
Corioli
back
Send
us
to
Rome
The
best
with
whom
we
may
articulate
For
their
own
good
and
ours
I
shall
my
lord
The
gods
begin
to
mock
me
I
that
now
Refusd
most
princely
gifts
am
bound
to
beg
Of
my
Lord
General
Taket
tis
yours
what
ist
I
sometime
lay
here
in
Corioli
At
a
poor
mans
house
he
usd
me
kindly
He
cried
to
me
I
saw
him
prisoner
But
then
Aufidius
was
within
my
view
And
wrath
oerwhelmd
my
pity
I
request
you
To
give
my
poor
host
freedom
well
beggd
Were
he
the
butcher
of
my
son
he
should
Be
free
as
is
the
wind
Deliver
him
Titus
Marcius
his
name
By
Jupiter
forgot
I
am
weary
yea
my
memory
is
tird
Have
we
no
wine
here
Go
we
to
our
tent
The
blood
upon
your
visage
dries
tis
time
It
should
be
lookd
to
Come
Come
come
they
are
almost
here
How
many
stand
for
consulships
Three
they
say
but
tis
thought
of
every
one
Coriolanus
will
carry
it
Thats
a
brave
fellow
but
hes
vengeance
proud
and
loves
not
the
common
people
Faith
there
have
been
many
great
men
that
have
flatterd
the
people
who
neer
loved
them
and
there
be
many
that
they
have
loved
they
know
not
wherefore
so
that
if
they
love
they
know
not
why
they
hate
upon
no
better
a
ground
Therefore
for
Coriolanus
neither
to
care
whether
they
love
or
hate
him
manifests
the
true
knowledge
he
has
in
their
disposition
and
out
of
his
noble
carelessness
lets
them
plainly
seet
If
he
did
not
care
whether
he
had
their
love
or
no
he
waved
indifferently
twixt
doing
them
neither
good
nor
harm
but
he
seeks
their
hate
with
greater
devotion
than
they
can
render
it
him
and
leaves
nothing
undone
that
may
fully
discover
him
their
opposite
Now
to
seem
to
affect
the
malice
and
displeasure
of
the
people
is
as
bad
as
that
which
he
dislikes
to
flatter
them
for
their
love
He
hath
deserved
worthily
of
his
country
and
his
ascent
is
not
by
such
easy
degrees
as
those
who
having
been
supple
and
courteous
to
the
people
bonneted
without
any
further
deed
to
have
them
at
all
into
their
estimation
and
report
but
he
hath
so
planted
his
honours
in
their
eyes
and
his
actions
in
their
hearts
that
for
their
tongues
to
be
silent
and
not
confess
so
much
were
a
kind
of
ingrateful
injury
to
report
otherwise
were
a
malice
that
giving
itself
the
lie
would
pluck
reproof
and
rebuke
from
every
car
that
heard
it
No
more
of
him
hes
a
worthy
man
Make
way
they
are
coming
sennet
Enter
the
and
the
before
them
the
Consul
and
take
their
places
by
themselves
stands
Having
determind
of
the
Volsces
and
To
send
for
Titus
Lartius
it
remains
As
the
main
point
of
this
our
aftermeeting
To
gratify
his
noble
service
that
Hath
thus
stood
for
his
country
Therefore
please
you
Most
reverend
and
grave
elders
to
desire
The
present
consul
and
last
general
In
our
wellfound
successes
to
report
little
of
that
worthy
work
performd
By
Caius
Marcius
Coriolanus
whom
We
met
here
both
to
thank
and
to
remember
With
honours
like
himself
sits
Speak
good
Cominius
Leave
nothing
out
for
length
and
make
us
think
Rather
our
states
defective
for
requital
Than
we
to
stretch
it
out
Masters
o
th
people
We
do
request
your
kindest
ears
and
after
Your
loving
motion
toward
the
common
body
To
yield
what
passes
here
We
are
convented
Upon
a
pleasing
treaty
and
have
hearts
Inclinable
to
honour
and
advance
The
theme
of
our
assembly
Which
the
rather
We
shall
be
blessd
to
do
if
he
remember
kinder
value
of
the
people
than
He
hath
hereto
prizd
them
at
Thats
off
thats
off
I
would
you
rather
had
been
silent
Please
you
To
hear
Cominius
speak
Most
willingly
But
yet
my
caution
was
more
pertinent
Than
the
rebuke
you
give
it
He
loves
your
people
But
tie
him
not
to
be
their
bedfellow
Worthy
Cominius
speak
rises
and
offers
to
go
away
Nay
keep
your
place
Sit
Coriolanus
never
shame
to
hear
What
you
have
nobly
done
Your
Honours
pardon
I
had
rather
have
my
wounds
to
heal
again
Than
hear
say
how
I
got
them
Sir
I
hope
My
words
disbenchd
you
not
No
sir
yet
oft
When
blows
have
made
me
stay
I
fled
from
words
You
soothd
not
therefore
hurt
not
But
your
people
I
love
them
as
they
weigh
Pray
now
sit
down
I
had
rather
have
one
scratch
my
head
i
th
sun
When
the
alarum
were
struck
than
idly
sit
To
hear
my
nothings
monsterd
Masters
of
the
people
Your
multiplying
spawn
how
can
he
flatter
Thats
thousand
to
one
good
one
when
you
now
see
He
had
rather
venture
all
his
limbs
for
honour
Than
one
ons
ears
to
hear
it
Proceed
Cominius
I
shall
lack
voice
the
deeds
of
Coriolanus
Should
not
be
utterd
feebly
It
is
held
That
valour
is
the
chiefest
virtue
and
Most
dignifies
the
haver
If
it
be
The
man
I
speak
of
cannot
in
the
world
Be
singly
counterpoisd
At
sixteen
years
When
Tarquin
made
a
head
for
Rome
he
fought
Beyond
the
mark
of
others
our
then
Dictator
Whom
with
all
praise
I
point
at
saw
him
fight
When
with
his
Amazonian
chin
he
drove
The
bristled
lips
before
him
he
bestrid
An
oerpressd
Roman
and
i
th
consuls
view
Slew
three
opposers
Tarquins
self
he
met
And
struck
him
on
his
knee
In
that
days
feats
When
he
might
act
the
woman
in
the
scene
He
provd
best
man
i
th
field
and
for
his
meed
Was
browbound
with
the
oak
His
pupil
age
Manentred
thus
he
waxed
like
a
sea
And
in
the
brunt
of
seventeen
battles
since
He
lurchd
all
swords
of
the
garland
For
this
last
Before
and
in
Corioli
let
me
say
I
cannot
speak
him
home
He
stoppd
the
fliers
And
by
his
rare
example
made
the
coward
Turn
terror
into
sport
as
weeds
before
vessel
under
sail
so
men
obeyd
And
fell
below
his
stem
His
sword
deaths
stamp
Where
it
did
mark
it
took
from
face
to
foot
He
was
a
thing
of
blood
whose
every
motion
Was
timd
with
dying
cries
Alone
he
entred
The
mortal
gate
of
th
city
which
he
painted
With
shunless
destiny
aidless
came
off
And
with
a
sudden
reenforcement
struck
Corioli
like
a
planet
Now
alls
his
When
by
and
by
the
din
of
war
gan
pierce
His
ready
sense
then
straight
his
doubled
spirit
Requickned
what
in
flesh
was
fatigate
And
to
the
battle
came
he
where
he
did
Run
reeking
oer
the
lives
of
men
as
if
Twere
a
perpetual
spoil
and
till
we
calld
Both
field
and
city
ours
he
never
stood
To
ease
his
breast
with
panting
Worthy
man
He
cannot
but
with
measure
fit
the
honours
Which
we
devise
him
Our
spoils
he
kickd
at
And
lookd
upon
things
precious
as
they
were
The
common
muck
of
the
world
He
covets
less
Than
misery
itself
would
give
rewards
His
deeds
with
doing
them
and
is
content
To
spend
the
time
to
end
it
Hes
right
noble
Let
him
be
calld
for
Call
Coriolanus
He
doth
appear
Reenter
The
Senate
Coriolanus
are
well
pleasd
To
make
thee
consul
I
do
owe
them
still
My
life
and
services
It
then
remains
That
you
do
speak
to
the
people
I
do
beseech
you
Let
me
oerleap
that
custom
for
I
cannot
Put
on
the
gown
stand
naked
and
entreat
them
For
my
wounds
sake
to
give
their
suffrage
Please
you
That
I
may
pass
this
doing
Sir
the
people
Must
have
their
voices
neither
will
they
bate
One
jot
of
ceremony
Put
them
not
tot
Pray
you
go
fit
you
to
the
custom
and
Take
to
you
as
your
predecessors
have
Your
honour
with
your
form
It
is
a
part
That
I
shall
blush
in
acting
and
might
well
Be
taken
from
the
people
Mark
you
that
To
brag
unto
them
Thus
I
did
and
thus
Show
them
th
unaching
scars
which
I
should
hide
As
if
I
had
receivd
them
for
the
hire
Of
their
breath
only
Do
not
stand
upont
We
recommend
to
you
Tribunes
of
the
People
Our
purpose
to
them
and
to
our
noble
consul
Wish
we
all
joy
and
honour
To
Coriolanus
come
all
joy
and
honour
Flourish
Cornets
Then
exeunt
all
but
and
You
see
how
he
intends
to
use
the
people
May
they
perceives
intent
He
will
require
them
As
if
he
did
contemn
what
he
requested
Should
be
in
them
to
give
Come
well
inform
them
Of
our
proceedings
here
On
th
marketplace
I
know
they
do
attend
us
Let
them
pull
all
about
mine
ears
present
me
Death
on
the
wheel
or
at
wild
horses
heels
Or
pile
ten
hills
on
the
Tarpeian
rock
That
the
precipitation
might
down
stretch
Below
the
beam
of
sight
yet
will
I
still
Be
thus
to
them
You
do
the
nobler
I
muse
my
mother
Does
not
approve
me
further
who
was
wont
To
call
them
woollen
vassals
things
created
To
buy
and
sell
with
groats
to
show
bare
heads
In
congregations
to
yawn
be
still
and
wonder
When
one
but
of
my
ordinance
stood
up
To
speak
of
peace
or
war
Enter
I
talk
of
you
Why
did
you
wish
me
milder
Would
you
have
me
False
to
my
nature
Rather
say
I
play
The
man
I
am
sir
sir
sir
I
would
have
had
you
put
your
power
well
on
Before
you
had
worn
it
out
Let
go
You
might
have
been
enough
the
man
you
are
With
striving
less
to
be
so
lesser
had
been
The
thwartings
of
your
dispositions
if
You
had
not
showd
them
how
ye
were
disposd
Ere
they
lackd
power
to
cross
you
Let
them
hang
Ay
and
burn
too
Enter
with
the
Come
come
you
have
been
too
rough
something
too
rough
You
must
return
and
mend
it
Theres
no
remedy
Unless
by
not
so
doing
our
good
city
Cleave
in
the
midst
and
perish
Pray
be
counselld
I
have
a
heart
as
little
apt
as
yours
But
yet
a
brain
that
leads
my
use
of
anger
To
better
vantage
Well
said
noble
woman
Before
he
should
thus
stoop
to
th
herd
but
that
The
violent
fit
o
th
time
craves
it
as
physic
For
the
whole
state
I
would
put
mine
armour
on
Which
I
can
scarcely
bear
What
must
I
do
Return
to
th
tribunes
Well
what
then
what
then
Repent
what
you
have
spoke
For
them
I
cannot
do
it
to
the
gods
Must
I
then
dot
to
them
You
are
too
absolute
Though
therein
you
can
never
be
too
noble
But
when
extremities
speak
I
have
heard
you
say
Honour
and
policy
like
unseverd
friends
I
th
war
do
grow
together
grant
that
and
tell
me
In
peace
what
each
of
them
by
th
other
lose
That
they
combine
not
there
Tush
tush
good
demand
If
it
be
honour
in
your
wars
to
seem
The
same
you
are
not
which
for
your
best
ends
You
adopt
your
policy
how
is
it
less
or
worse
That
it
shall
hold
companionship
in
peace
With
honour
as
in
war
since
that
to
both
It
stands
in
like
request
Why
force
you
this
Because
that
now
it
lies
you
on
to
speak
To
th
people
not
by
your
own
instruction
Nor
by
th
matter
which
your
heart
prompts
you
But
with
such
words
that
are
but
roted
in
Your
tongue
though
but
bastards
and
syllables
Of
no
allowance
to
your
bosoms
truth
Now
this
no
more
dishonours
you
at
all
Than
to
take
in
a
town
with
gentle
words
Which
else
would
put
you
to
your
fortune
and
The
hazard
of
much
blood
I
would
dissemble
with
my
nature
where
My
fortunes
and
my
friends
at
stake
requird
I
should
do
so
in
honour
I
am
in
this
Your
wife
your
son
these
senators
the
nobles
And
you
will
rather
show
our
general
louts
How
you
can
frown
than
spend
a
fawn
upon
em
For
the
inheritance
of
their
loves
and
safeguard
Of
what
that
want
might
ruin
Noble
lady
Come
go
with
us
speak
fair
you
may
salve
so
Not
what
is
dangerous
present
but
the
los
Of
what
is
past
I
prithee
now
My
son
Go
to
them
with
this
bonnet
in
thy
hand
And
thus
far
having
stretchd
it
here
be
with
them
Thy
knee
bussing
the
stones
for
in
such
busines
Action
is
eloquence
and
the
eyes
of
th
ignorant
More
learned
than
the
ears
waving
thy
head
Which
often
thus
correcting
thystout
heart
Now
humble
as
the
ripest
mulberry
That
will
not
hold
the
handling
Or
say
to
them
Thou
art
their
soldier
and
being
bred
in
broils
Hast
not
the
soft
way
which
thou
dost
confess
Were
fit
for
thee
to
use
as
they
to
claim
In
asking
their
good
loves
but
thou
wilt
frame
Thyself
forsooth
hereafter
theirs
so
far
As
thou
hast
power
and
person
This
but
done
Even
as
she
speaks
why
their
hearts
were
yours
For
they
have
pardons
being
askd
as
free
As
words
to
little
purpose
Prithee
now
Go
and
be
ruld
although
I
know
thou
hadst
rather
Follow
thine
enemy
in
a
fiery
gulf
Than
flatter
him
in
a
bower
Enter
Here
is
Cominius
I
have
been
i
th
marketplace
and
sir
tis
fit
You
make
strong
party
or
defend
yourself
By
calmness
or
by
absence
alls
in
anger
Only
fair
speech
I
think
twill
serve
if
he
Can
thereto
frame
his
spirit
He
must
and
will
Prithee
now
say
you
will
and
go
about
it
Must
I
go
show
them
my
unbarbd
sconce
Must
I
With
my
base
tongue
give
to
my
noble
heart
lie
that
it
must
bear
Well
I
will
dot
Yet
were
there
but
this
single
plot
to
lose
This
mould
of
Marcius
they
to
dust
should
grind
it
And
throwt
against
the
wind
To
th
marketplace
You
have
put
me
now
to
such
a
part
which
never
I
shall
discharge
to
th
life
Come
come
well
prompt
you
I
prithee
now
sweet
son
as
thou
hast
said
My
praises
made
thee
first
a
soldier
so
To
have
my
praise
for
this
perform
a
part
Thou
hast
not
done
before
Well
I
must
dot
Away
my
disposition
and
possess
me
Some
harlots
spirit
My
throat
of
war
be
turnd
Which
quierd
with
my
drum
into
a
pipe
Small
as
an
eunuch
or
the
virgin
voice
That
babies
lulls
asleep
The
smiles
of
knaves
Tent
in
my
cheeks
and
schoolboys
tears
take
up
The
glasses
of
my
sight
beggars
tongue
Make
motion
through
my
lips
and
my
armd
knees
Who
bowd
but
in
my
stirrup
bend
like
his
That
hath
receivd
an
alms
I
will
not
dot
Lest
I
surcease
to
honour
mine
own
truth
And
by
my
bodys
action
teach
my
mind
most
inherent
baseness
At
thy
choice
then
To
beg
of
thee
it
is
my
more
dishonour
Than
thou
of
them
Come
all
to
ruin
Let
Thy
mother
rather
feel
thy
pride
than
fear
Thy
dangerous
stoutness
for
I
mock
at
death
With
as
big
heart
as
thou
Do
as
thou
list
Thy
valiantness
was
mine
thou
suckdst

from
me
But
owe
thy
pride
thyself
Pray

content

To

Good

Twas

incensd
the
rabble
Cats

Pray

Now

You

a
brave
deed
Ere

The
meanest
house
in
Rome
so
far
my
son
This
ladys
husband

do
you
see
Whom
you
have
banishd
does

Well

Why

baited
With
one
that
wants
her
wits
Take
my
prayers
with
you
I
would
the
gods
had
nothing
else
to
do
But
to
confirm
my
curses
Could
I
meet
em
But
once
a
day
it
would
unclog
my
heart
Of
what
lies
heavy
tot
You
have
told
them
home
And
by
my
troth
you
have
cause
Youll
sup
with
me
Angers
my
meat
I
sup
upon
myself
And
so
shall
starve
with
feeding
Come
lets
go
Leave
this
faint
puling
and
lament
as
I
do
In
anger
Junolike
Come
come
come
Fie
fie
fie
goodly
city
is
this
Antium
City
Tis
I
that
made
thy
widows
many
an
heir
Of
these
fair
edifices
fore
my
wars
Have
I
heard
groan
and
drop
Then
know
me
not
Lest
that
thy
wives
with
spits
and
boys
with
stones
In
puny
battle
slay
me
Enter
Save
you
sir
And
you
Direct
me
if
it
be
your
will
Where
great
Aufidius
lies
Is
he
in
Antium
He
is
and
feasts
the
nobles
of
the
state
At
his
house
this
night
Which
is
his
house
beseech
you
This
here
before
you
Thank
you
sir
farewell
world
thy
slippery
turns
Friends
now
fast
sworn
Whose
double
bosoms
seems
to
wear
one
heart
Whose
hours
whose
bed
whose
meal
and
exercise
Are
still
together
who
twin
as
twere
in
love
Unseparable
shall
within
this
hour
On
a
dissension
of
a
doit
break
out
To
bitterest
enmity
so
fellest
foes
Whose
passions
and
whose
plots
have
broke
their
sleep
To
take
the
one
the
other
by
some
chance
Some
trick
not
worth
an
egg
shall
grow
dear
friends
And
interjoin
their
issues
So
with
me
My
birthplace
hate
I
and
my
loves
upon
This
enemy
town
Ill
enter
If
he
slay
me
He
does
fair
justice
if
he
give
me
way
Ill
do
his
country
service
We
hear
not
of
him
neither
need
we
fear
him
His
remedies
are
tame
The
present
peace
And
quietness
of
the
people
which
before
Were
in
wild
hurry
here
do
make
his
friends
Blush
that
the
world
goes
well
who
rather
had
Though
they
themselves
did
suffer
byt
behold
Dissentious
numbers
pestring
streets
than
see
Our
tradesmen
singing
in
their
shops
and
going
About
their
functions
friendly
Enter
We
stood
tot
in
good
time
Is
this
Menenius
Tis
he
tis
he
he
is
grown
most
kind
Of
late
Hail
sir
Hail
to
you
both
Your
Coriolanus
is
not
much
missd
But
with
his
friends
The
commonwealth
doth
stand
And
so
would
do
were
he
more
angry
at
it
Alls
well
and
might
have
been
much
better
He
could
have
temporizd
Where
is
he
hear
you
Nay
I
hear
nothing
his
mother
and
his
wife
Hear
nothing
from
him
Enter
three
or
four
citizens
The
gods
preserve
you
both
Godden
our
neighbours
Godden
to
you
all
godden
to
you
an
Ourselves
our
wives
and
children
on
our
knees
Are
bound
to
pray
for
you
both
Live
and
thrive
Farewell
kind
neighbours
we
wishd
Coriolanus
Had
lovd
you
as
we
did
Now
the
gods
keep
you
Farewell
farewell
This
is
a
happier
and
more
comely
time
Than
when
these
fellows
ran
about
the
streets
Crying
confusion
Caius
Marcius
was
worthy
officer
i
the
war
but
insolent
Oercome
with
pride
ambitious
past
all
thinking
Selfloving
And
affecting
one
sole
throne
Without
assistance
I
think
not
so
We
should
by
this
to
all
our
lamentation
If
he
had
gone
forth
consul
found
it
so
The
gods
have
well
prevented
it
and
Rome
Sits
safe
and
still
without
him
Enter
an
Worthy
tribunes
There
is
a
slave
whom
we
have
put
in
prison
Reports
the
Volsces
with
several
powers
Are
entred
in
the
Roman
territories
And
with
the
deepest
malice
of
the
war
Destroy
what
lies
before
em
Tis
Aufidius
Who
hearing
of
our
Marcius
banishment
Thrusts
forth
his
horns
again
into
the
world
Which
were
inshelld
when
Marcius
stood
for
Rome
And
durst
not
once
peep
out
Come
what
talk
you
of
Marcius
Go
see
this
rumourer
whippd
It
cannot
be
The
Volsces
dare
break
with
us
Cannot
be
We
have
record
that
very
well
it
can
And
three
examples
of
the
like
hath
been
Within
my
age
But
reason
with
the
fellow
Before
you
punish
him
where
he
heard
this
Lest
you
shall
chance
to
whip
your
information
And
beat
the
messenger
who
bids
beware
Of
what
is
to
be
dreaded
Tell
not
me
I
know
this
cannot
be
Not
Possible
Enter
The
nobles
in
great
earnestness
are
going
All
to
the
Senate
House
some
news
is
come
That
turns
their
countenances
Tis
this
slave
Go
whip
him
fore
the
peoples
eyes
his
raising
Nothing
but
his
report
Yes
worthy
sir
The
slaves
report
is
seconded
and
more
More
fearful
is
deliverd
What
more
fearful
It
is
spoke
freely
out
of
many
mouths
How
probable
I
do
not
know
that
Marcius
Joind
with
Aufidius
leads
a
power
gainst
Rome
And
vows
revenge
as
spacious
as
between
The
youngst
and
oldest
thing
This
is
most
likely
Raisd
only
that
the
weaker
sort
may
wish
Good
Marcius
home
again
The
very
trick
on
t
This
is
unlikely
He
and
Aufidius
can
no
more
atone
Than
violentst
contrariety
Enter
a
second
You
are
sent
for
to
the
Senate
fearful
army
led
by
Caius
Marcius
Associated
with
Aufidius
rages
Upon
our
territories
and
have
already
Oerborne
their
way
consumd
with
fire
and
took
What
lay
before
them
Enter
you
have
made
good
work
What
news
what
news
You
have
holp
to
ravish
your
own
daughters
and
To
melt
the
city
leads
upon
your
pates
To
see
your
wives
dishonourd
to
your
noses
Whats
the
news
Whats
the
news
Your
temples
burned
in
their
cement
and
Your
franchises
whereon
you
stood
confind
Into
an
augers
bore
Pray
now
your
news
You
have
made
fair
work
I
fear
me
Pray
your
news
If
Marcius
should
be
joind
wi
th
Volscians
If
He
is
their
god
he
leads
them
like
a
thing
Made
by
some
other
deity
than
Nature
That
shapes
man
better
and
they
follow
him
Against
us
brats
with
no
less
confidence
Than
boys
pursuing
summer
butterflies
Or
butchers
killing
flies
You
have
made
good
work
You
and
your
apron
men
you
that
stood
so
much
Upon
the
voice
of
occupation
and
The
breath
of
garliceaters
Hell
shake
Your
Rome
about
your
ears
As
Hercules
Did
shake
down
mellow
fruit
You
have
made
fair
work
But
is
this
true
sir
Ay
and
youll
look
pale
Before
you
find
it
other
All
the
regions
Do
smilingly
revolt
and
who
resists
Are
mockd
for
valiant
ignorance
And
perish
constant
fools
Who
ist
can
blame
him
Your
enemies
and
his
find
something
in
him
We
are
all
undone
unless
The
noble
man
have
mercy
Who
shall
ask
it
The
tribunes
cannot
dot
for
shame
the
people
Deserve
such
pity
of
him
as
the
wolf
Does
of
the
shepherds
for
his
best
friends
if
they
Should
say
Be
good
to
Rome
they
chargd
him
even
As
those
should
do
that
had
deservd
his
hate
And
therein
showd
fike
enemies
Tis
true
If
he
were
putting
to
my
house
the
brand
That
should
consume
it
I
have
not
the
face
To
say
Beseech
you
cease
You
have
made
fair
hands
You
and
your
crafts
You
have
crafted
fair
You
have
brought
trembling
upon
Rome
such
as
was
never
incapable
of
help
Say
not
we
brought
it
How
Wast
we
We
lovd
him
but
like
beasts
And
cowardly
nobles
gave
way
unto
your
clusters
Who
did
hoot
him
out
o
th
city
But
I
fear
Theyll
roar
him
in
again
Tullus
Aufidius
The
second
name
of
men
obeys
his
points
As
if
he
were
his
officer
Desperation
Is
all
the
policy
strength
and
defence
That
Rome
can
make
against
them
Enter
a
troop
of
citizens
Here
comes
the
clusters
And
is
Aufidius
with
him
You
are
they
That
made
the
air
unwholesome
when
you
cast
Your
stinking
greasy
caps
in
hooting
at
Coriolanus
exile
Now
hes
coming
And
not
a
hair
upon
a
soldiers
head
Which
will
not
prove
a
whip
as
many
coxcombs
As
you
threw
caps
up
will
he
tumble
down
And
pay
you
for
your
voices
Tis
no
matter
If
he
could
burn
us
all
into
one
coal
We
have
deservd
it
Faith
we
hear
fearful
news
For
mine
own
part
When
I
said
banish
him
I
said
twas
pity
And
so
did
I
And
so
did
I
and
to
say
the
truth
so
did
very
many
of
us
That
we
did
we
did
for
the
best
and
though
we
willingly
consented
to
his
banishment
yet
it
was
against
our
will
Yare
goodly
things
you
voices
You
have
made
Good
work
you
and
your
cry
Shalls
to
the
Capitol
ay
what
else
Go
masters
get
you
be
not
dismayd
These
are
a
side
that
would
be
glad
to
have
This
true
which
they
so
seem
to
fear
Go
home
And
show
no
sign
of
fear
The
gods
be
good
to
us
Come
masters
lets
home
I
ever
said
we
were
i
th
wrong
when
we
banishd
him
So
did
we
all
But
come
lets
home
I
do
not
like
this
news
Nor
I
Lets
to
the
Capitol
Would
half
my
wealth
Would
buy
this
for
a
lie
Pray
lets
go
Stay
Whence
are
you
Stand
and
go
back
You
guard
like
men
tis
well
but
by
your
leave
I
am
an
officer
of
state
and
come
To
speak
with
Coriolanus
From
whence
From
Rome
may
not
pass
you
must
return
Our
general
Will
no
more
hear
from
thence
Youll
see
your
Rome
embracd
with
fire
before
Youll
speak
with
Coriolanus
Good
my
friends
If
you
have
heard
your
general
talk
of
Rome
And
of
his
friends
there
it
is
lots
to
blanks
My
name
hath
touchd
your
ears
it
is
Menenius
Be
it
so
go
back
The
virtue
of
your
name
Is
not
here
passable
I
tell
thee
fellow
Thy
general
is
my
lover
I
have
been
The
book
of
his
good
acts
whence
men
have
read
His
fame
unparalleld
haply
amplified
For
I
have
ever
verified
my
friends
Of
whom
hes
chief
with
all
the
size
that
verity
Would
without
lapsing
suffer
Nay
sometimes
Like
to
a
bowl
upon
a
subtle
ground
I
have
tumbled
past
the
throw
and
in
his
praise
Have
almost
stampd
the
leasing
therefore
fellow
I
must
have
leave
to
pass
Faith
sir
if
you
had
told
as
many
lies
in
his
behalf
as
you
have
uttered
words
in
your
own
you
should
not
pass
here
no
though
it
were
as
virtuous
to
lie
as
to
live
chastely
Therefore
go
back
Prithee
fellow
remember
my
name
is
Menenius
always
factionary
on
the
party
of
your
general
Howsoever
you
have
been
his
liar
as
you
say
you
have
I
am
one
that
telling
true
under
him
must
say
you
cannot
pass
Therefore
go
back
Has
he
dind
canst
thou
tell
For
I
would
not
speak
with
him
till
after
dinner
You
are
a
Roman
are
you
I
am
as
thy
general
is
Then
you
should
hate
Rome
as
he
does
Can
you
when
you
have
pushd
out
your
gates
the
very
defender
of
them
and
in
a
violent
popular
ignorance
given
your
enemy
your
shield
think
to
front
his
revenges
with
the
easy
groans
of
old
women
the
virginal
palms
of
your
daughters
or
with
the
palsied
intercession
of
such
a
decayd
dotant
as
you
seem
to
be
Can
you
think
to
blow
out
the
intended
fire
your
city
is
ready
to
flame
in
with
such
weak
breath
as
this
No
you
are
deceivd
therefore
back
to
Rome
and
prepare
for
your
execution
You
are
condemnd
our
general
has
sworn
you
out
of
reprieve
and
pardon
Sirrah
if
thy
captain
knew
I
were
here
he
would
use
me
with
estimation
Come
my
captain
knows
you
not
I
mean
thy
general
My
general
cares
not
for
you
Back
I
say
go
lest
I
let
forth
your
half
pint
of
blood
Back
thats
the
utmost
of
your
having
Back
Nay
but
fellow
fellow
Enter
with
Whats
the
matter
Now
you
companion
Ill
say
an
errand
for
you
you
shall
know
now
that
I
am
in
estimation
you
shall
perceive
that
a
Jack
guardant
cannot
office
me
from
my
son
Coriolanus
Guess
but
by
my
entertainment
with
him
if
thou
standst
not
i
th
state
of
hanging
or
of
some
death
more
long
in
spectatorship
and
crueller
in
suffering
behold
now
presently
and
swoon
for
whats
to
come
upon
thee
The
glorious
gods
sit
in
hourly
synod
about
thy
particular
prosperity
and
love
thee
no
worse
than
thy
old
father
Menenius
does
my
son
my
son
thou
art
preparing
fire
for
us
look
thee
heres
water
to
quench
it
I
was
hardly
moved
to
come
to
thee
but
being
assured
none
but
myself
could
move
thee
I
have
been
blown
out
of
your
gates
with
sighs
and
conjure
thee
to
pardon
Rome
and
thy
petitionary
countrymen
The
good
gods
assuage
thy
wrath
and
turn
the
dregs
of
it
upon
this
varlet
here
this
who
like
a
block
hath
denied
my
access
to
thee
Away
How
away
Wife
mother
child
I
know
not
My
affairs
Are
servanted
to
others
Though
I
owe
My
revenge
properly
my
remission
lies
In
Volscian
breasts
That
we
have
been
familiar
Ingrate
forgetfulness
shall
poison
rather
Than
pity
note
how
much
Therefore
be
gone
Mine
ears
against
your
suits
are
stronger
than
Your
gates
against
my
force
Yet
for
I
lovd
thee
Take
this
along
I
writ
it
for
thy
sake
Gives
a
letter
And
would
have
sent
it
Another
word
Menenius
I
will
not
hear
thee
speak
This
man
Aufidius
Was
my
belovd
in
Rome
yet
thou
beholdst
You
keep
a
constant
temper
Now
sir
is
your
name
Menenius
Tis
a
spell
you
see
of
much
power
You
know
the
way
home
again
Do
you
hear
how
we
are
shent
for
keeping
your
greatness
back
What
cause
do
you
think
I
have
to
swoon
I
neither
care
for
th
world
nor
your
general
for
such
things
as
you
I
can
scarce
think
theres
any
yare
so
slight
He
that
hath
a
will
to
die
by
himself
fears
it
not
from
another
Let
your
general
do
his
worst
For
you
be
that
you
are
long
and
your
misery
increase
with
your
age
I
say
to
you
as
I
was
said
to
Away
noble
fellow
I
warrant
him
The
worthy
fellow
is
our
general
hes
the
rock
the
oak
not
to
be
windshaken
See
you
yond
coign
o
th
Capitol
yond
cornerstone
Why
what
of
that
If
it
be
possible
for
you
to
displace
it
with
your
little
finger
there
is
some
hope
the
ladies
of
Rome
especially
his
mother
may
prevail
with
him
But
I
say
there
is
no
hope
int
our
throats
are
sentencd
and
stay
upon
execution
Ist
possible
that
so
short
a
time
can
alter
the
condition
of
a
man
There
is
differency
between
a
grub
and
a
butterfly
yet
your
butterfly
was
a
grub
This
Marcius
is
grown
from
man
to
dragon
he
has
wings
hes
more
than
a
creeping
thing
He
lovd
his
mother
dearly
So
did
he
me
and
he
no
more
remembers
his
mother
now
than
an
eightyearold
horse
The
tartness
of
his
face
sours
ripe
grapes
when
he
walks
he
moves
like
an
engine
and
the
ground
shrinks
before
his
treading
He
is
able
to
pierce
a
corslet
with
his
eye
talks
like
a
knell
and
his
hum
is
a
battery
He
sits
in
his
state
as
a
thing
made
for
Alexander
What
he
bids
be
done
is
finishd
with
his
bidding
He
wants
nothing
of
a
god
but
eternity
and
a
heaven
to
throne
in
Yes
mercy
if
you
report
him
truly
I
paint
him
in
the
character
Mark
what
mercy
his
mother
shall
bring
from
him
There
is
no
more
mercy
in
him
than
there
is
milk
in
a
male
tiger
that
shall
our
poor
city
find
And
all
this
is
long
of
you
The
gods
be
good
unto
us
No
in
such
a
case
the
gods
will
not
be
good
unto
us
When
we
banishd
him
we
respected
not
them
and
he
returning
to
break
our
necks
they
respect
not
us
Enter
a
Sir
if
youd
save
your
life
fly
to
your
house
The
plebeians
have
got
your
fellow
tribune
And
hale
him
up
and
down
all
swearing
if
The
Roman
ladies
bring
not
comfort
home
Theyll
give
him
death
by
inches
Enter
another
Whats
the
news
Good
news
good
news
The
ladies
have
prevaild
The
Volscians
are
dislodgd
and
Marcius
gone
merrier

never
yet
greet
Rome
No
not
th
expulsion
of
the
Tarquins
Friend
Art
thou
certain
this
is
true
Ist
most
certain
As
certain
as
I
know
the
sun
is
fire
Where
have
you
lurkd
that
you
make
doubt
of
it
Neer
through
an
arch
so
hurried
the
blown
tide
As
the
recomforted
through
th
gates
Why
hark
you
Trumpets
hautboys
drums
beat
all
together
The
trumpets
sackbuts
psalteries
and
fifes
Tabors
and
cymbals
and
the
shouting
Romans
Make
the
sun
dance
Hark
you
shout
within
This
is
good
news
I
will
go
meet
the
ladies
This
Volumnia
Is
worth
of
consuls
senators
patricians
city
full
of
tribunes
such
as
you
sea
and
land
full
You
have
prayd
well
today
This
morning
for
ten
thousand
of
your
throats
Id
not
have
given
a
doit
Hark

Sound

with
the
shouts
First

gods

for
your
tidings

Accept
my
thankfulness
Sir

all
Great
cause
to
give
great
thanks
They
are
near
the
city
Almost
at
point
to
enter
Well
meet
them
And
help
the
joy
Go
tell
the
lords
o
th
city
I
am
here
Deliver
them
this
paper
having
read
it
Bid
them
repair
to
th
marketplace
where
I
Even
in
theirs
and
in
the
commons
ears
Will
vouch
the
truth
of
it
Him
I
accuse
The
city
ports
by
this
hath
enterd
and
Intends
t
appear
before
the
people
hoping
To
purge
himself
with
words
Dispatch
Enter
three
or
four
of
faction
Most
welcome
How
is
it
with
our
general
Even
so
As
with
a
man
by
his
own
alms
empoisond
And
with
his
charity
slain
Most
noble
sir
If
you
do
hold
the
same
intent
wherein
You
wishd
us
parties
well
deliver
you
Of
your
great
danger
Sir
I
cannot
tell
We
must
proceed
as
we
do
find
the
people
The
people
will
remain
uncertain
whilst
Twixt
you
theres
difference
but
the
fall
of
either
Makes
the
survivor
heir
of
all
I
know
it
And
my
pretext
to
strike
at
him
admits
good
construction
I
raisd
him
and
I
pawnd
Mine
honour
for
his
truth
who
being
so
heightend
He
watered
his
new
plants
with
dews
of
flattery
Seducing
so
my
friends
and
to
this
end
He
bowd
his
nature
never
known
before
But
to
be
rough
unswayable
and
free
Sir
his
stoutness
When
he
did
stand
for
consul
which
he
lost
By
lack
of
stooping
That
I
would
have
spoken
of
Being
banishd
fort
he
came
unto
my
hearth
Presented
to
my
knife
his
throat
I
took
him
Made
him
jointservant
with
me
gave
him
way
In
all
his
own
desires
nay
let
him
choose
Out
of
my
files
his
projects
to
accomplish
My
best
and
freshest
men
servd
his
designments
In
mine
own
person
holp
to
reap
the
fame
Which
he
did
end
all
his
and
took
some
pride
To
do
myself
this
wrong
Till
at
the
last
I
seemd
his
follower
not
partner
and
He
wagd
me
with
his
countenance
as
if
I
had
been
mercenary
So
he
did
my
lord
The
army
marvelld
at
it
and
in
the
last
When
he
had
carried
Rome
and
that
we
lookd
For
no
less
spoil
than
glory
There
was
it
For
which
my
sinews
shall
be
stretchd
upon
him
At
a
few
drops
of
womens
rheum
which
are
As
cheap
as
lies
he
sold
the
blood
and
labour
Of
our
great
action
therefore
shall
he
die
And
Ill
renew
me
in
his
fall
But
hark
Drums
and
trumpets
sound
with
great
shouts
of
the
people
Your
native
town
you
enterd
like
a
post
And
had
no
welcomes
home
but
he
returns
Splitting
the
air
with
noise
And
patient
fools
Whose
children
he
hath
slain
their
base
throats
tear
With
giving
him
glory
Therefore
at
your
vantage
Ere
he
express
himself
or
move
the
people
With
what
he
would
say
let
him
feel
your
sword
Which
we
will
second
When
he
lies
along
After
your
way
his
tale
pronouncd
shall
bury
His
reasons
with
his
body
Say
no
more
Here
come
the
lords
Enter
the
of
the
city
You
are
most
welcome
home
I
have
not
deservd
it
But
worthy
lords
have
you
with
heed
perused
What
I
have
written
to
you
We
have
And
grieve
to
heart
What
faults
he
made
before
the
last
I
think
Might
have
found
easy
fines
but
there
to
end
Where
he
was
to
begin
and
give
away
The
benefit
of
our
levies
answering
us
With
our
own
charge
making
a
treaty
where
There
was
a
yielding
this
admits
no
excuse
He
approaches
you
shall
hear
him
Enter
marching
with
drum
and
colours
the
commoners
being
with
him
Hail
lords
I
am
returnd
your
soldier
No
more
infected
with
my
countrys
love
Than
when
I
parted
hence
but
still
subsisting
Under
your
great
command
You
are
to
know
That
prosperously
I
have
attempted
and
With
bloody
passage
led
your
wars
even
to
The
gates
of
Rome
Our
spoils
we
have
brought
home
Doth
more
than
counterpoise
a
full
third
part
The
charges
of
the
action
We
have
made
peace
With
no
less
honour
to
the
Antiates
Than
shame
to
th
Romans
and
we
here
deliver
Subscribd
by
th
consuls
and
patricians
Together
with
the
seal
o
th
Senate
what
We
have
compounded
on
Read
it
not
noble
lords
But
tell
the
traitor
in
the
highest
degree
He
hath
abusd
your
powers
Traitor
How

Ay

Ay

Caius

Dost

Ill

with
that
robbery

name
Coriolanus
in
Corioli
You
lords
and
heads
o
th
state
perfidiously
He
has
betrayd
your
business
and
given
up
For
certain
drops
of
salt
your
city
Rome
I
say
your
city
to
his
wife
and
mother
Breaking
his
oath
and
resolution
like
twist
of
rotten
silk
never
admitting
Counsel
o
th
war
but
at
his
nurses
tears
He
whind
and
roard
away
your
victory
That
pages
blushd
at
him
and
men
of
heart
Lookd
wondring
each
at
others
Hearst

Mars
Name

Ha

Too

Pardon

I

Your

Must

Who

Must

To

Peace

Cut

That

Flutterd

Volscians
in
Corioli
Alone

Boy
Why

Will

blind
fortune
Which

Fore

Let

touchd
at
very
heart
None
but
the
King
He
that
hath
lost
her
too
So
is
the
Queen
That
most
desird
the
match
But
not
a
courtier
Although
they
wear
their
faces
to
the
bent
Of
the
Kings
looks
hath
a
heart
that
is
not
Glad
at
the
thing
they
scowl
at
And
why
so
He
that
hath
missd
the
Princess
is
a
thing
Too
bad
for
bad
report
and
he
that
hath
her
I
mean
that
married
her
alack
good
man
And
therefore
banishd
is
a
creature
such
As
to
seek
through
the
regions
of
the
earth
For
one
his
like
there
would
be
something
failing
In
him
that
should
compare
I
do
not
think
So
fair
an
outward
and
such
stuff
within
Endows
a
man
but
he
You
speak
him
far
I
do
extend
him
sir
within
himself
Crush
him
together
rather
than
unfold
His
measure
duly
Whats
his
name
and
birth
I
cannot
delve
him
to
the
root
his
father
Was
calld
Sicilius
who
did
join
his
honour
Against
the
Romans
with
Cassibelan
But
had
his
titles
by
Tenantius
whom
He
servd
with
glory
and
admird
success
So
gaind
the
suraddition
Leonatus
And
had
besides
this
gentleman
in
question
Two
other
sons
who
in
the
wars
o
th
time
Died
with
their
swords
in
hand
for
which
their
father
Then
old
and
fond
of
issue
took
such
sorrow
That
he
quit
being
and
his
gentle
lady
Big
of
this
gentleman
our
theme
deceasd
As
he
was
born
The
King
he
takes
the
babe
To
his
protection
calls
him
Posthumus
Leonatus
Breeds
him
and
makes
him
of
his
bedchamber
Puts
to
him
all
the
learnings
that
his
time
Could
make
him
the
receiver
of
which
he
took
As
we
do
air
fast
as
twas
ministred
And
ins
spring
became
a
harvest
livd
in
court
Which
rare
it
is
to
do
most
praisd
most
lovd
sample
to
the
youngest
to
th
more
mature
glass
that
feated
them
and
to
the
graver
child
that
guided
dotards
To
his
mistress
For
whom
he
now
is
banishd
her
own
price
Proclaims
how
she
esteemd
him
and
his
virtue
By
her
election
may
be
truly
read
What
kind
of
man
he
is
I
honour
him
Even
out
of
your
report
But
pray
you
tell
me
Is
she
sole
child
to
th
King
His
only
child
He
had
two
sons
if
this
be
worth
your
hearing
Mark
it
the
eldest
of
them
at
three
years
old
I
th
swathing
clothes
the
other
from
their
nursery
Were
stoln
and
to
this
hour
no
guess
in
knowledge
Which
way
they
went
How
long
is
this
ago
Some
twenty
years
That
a
kings
children
should
be
so
conveyd
So
slackly
guarded
and
the
search
so
slow
That
could
not
trace
them
Howsoeer
tis
strange
Or
that
the
negligence
may
well
be
laughd
at
Yet
is
it
true
sir
I
do
well
believe
you
We
must
forbear
here
comes
the
gentleman
The
Queen
and
Princess
Enter
the
and
No
be
assurd
you
shall
not
find
me
daughter
After
the
slander
of
most
stepmothers
Evileyd
unto
you
Youre
my
prisoner
but
Your
gaoler
shall
deliver
you
the
keys
That
lock
up
your
restraint
For
you
Posthumus
So
soon
as
I
can
win
th
offended
King
I
will
be
known
your
advocate
Marry
yet
The
fire
of
rage
is
in
him
and
twere
good
You
leand
unto
his
sentence
with
what
patience
Your
wisdom
may
inform
you
Please
your
Highness
I
will
from
hence
today
You
know
the
peril
Ill
fetch
a
turn
about
the
garden
pitying
The
pangs
of
barrd
affections
though
the
King
Hath
chargd
you
should
not
speak
together
dissembling
courtesy
How
fine
this
tyrant
Can
tickle
where
she
wounds
My
dearest
husband
I
something
fear
my
fathers
wrath
but
nothing
Always
reservd
my
holy
duty
what
His
rage
can
do
on
me
You
must
be
gone
And
I
shall
here
abide
the
hourly
shot
Of
angry
eyes
not
comforted
to
live
But
that
there
is
this
jewel
in
the
world
That
I
may
see
again
My
queen
my
mistress
lady
weep
no
more
lest
I
give
cause
To
be
suspected
of
more
tenderness
Than
doth
become
a
man
I
will
remain
The
loyalst
husband
that
did
eer
plight
troth
My
residence
in
Rome
at
one
Philarios
Who
to
my
father
was
a
friend
to
me
Known
but
by
letter
thither
write
my
queen
And
with
mine
eyes
Ill
drink
the
words
you
send
Though
ink
be
made
of
gall
Reenter
Be
brief
I
pray
you
If
the
King
come
I
shall
incur
I
know
not
How
much
of
his
displeasure
Aside
Yet
Ill
move
him
To
walk
this
way
I
never
do
him
wrong
But
he
does
buy
my
injuries
to
be
friends
Pays
dear
for
my
offences
Should
we
be
taking
leave
As
long
a
term
as
yet
we
have
to
live
The
loathness
to
depart
would
grow
Adieu
Nay
stay
a
little
Were
you
but
riding
forth
to
air
yourself
Such
parting
were
too
petty
Look
here
love
This
diamond
was
my
mothers
take
it
heart
But
keep
it
till
you
woo
another
wife
When
Imogen
is
dead
How
how
Another
You
gentle
gods
give
me
but
this
I
have
And
sear
up
my
embracements
from
a
next
With
bonds
of
death
Remain
remain
thou
here
Puts
on
the
ring
While
sense
can
keep
it
on
And
sweetest
fairest
As
I
my
poor
self
did
exchange
for
you
To
your
so
infinite
loss
so
in
our
trifles
I
still
win
of
you
For
my
sake
wear
this
It
is
a
manacle
of
love
Ill
place
it
Upon
this
fairest
prisoner
Puts
a
bracelet
on
her
arm
the
gods
When
shall
we
see
again
Enter
and
Alack
the
King
Thou
basest
thing
avoid
hence
from
my
sight
If
after
this
command
thou
fraught
the
court
With
thy
unworthiness
thou
diest
Away
Thourt
poison
to
my
blood
The
gods
protect
you
And
bless
the
good
remainders
of
the
court
I
am
gone
There
cannot
be
a
pinch
in
death
More
sharp
than
this
is
disloyal
thing
That
shouldst
repair
my
youth
thou
heapst
years
age
on
me
I
beseech
you
sir
Harm
not
yourself
with
your
vexation
I
am
senseless
of
your
wrath
a
touch
more
rare
Subdues
all
pangs
all
fears
Past
grace
obedience
Past
hope
and
in
despair
that
way
past
grace
That
mightst
have
had
the
sole
son
of
my
queen
blessed
that
I
might
not
I
chose
an
eagle
And
did
avoid
a
puttock
Thou
tookst
a
beggar
wouldst
have
made
my
throne
seat
for
baseness
No
I
rather
added
lustre
to
it
thou
vile
one
Sir
It
is
your
fault
that
I
have
lovd
Posthumus
You
bred
him
as
my
playfellow
and
he
is
man
worth
any
woman
overbuys
me
Almost
the
sum
he
pays
What
art
thou
mad
Almost
sir
Heaven
restore
me
Would
I
were
neatherds
daughter
and
my
Leonatus
Our
neighbour
shepherds
son
Reenter
Thou
foolish
thing
To
the
They
were
again
together
You
have
done
Not
after
our
command
Away
with
her
And
pen
her
up
Beseech
your
patience
Peace
Dear
lady
daughter
peace
Sweet
sovereign
Leave
us
to
ourselves
and
make
yourself
some
comfort
Out
of
your
best
advice
Nay
let
her
languish
drop
of
blood
a
day
and
being
aged
Die
of
this
folly
Enter
Fie
you
must
give
way
Here
is
your
servant
How
now
sir
What
news
My
lord
your
son
drew
on
my
master
Ha
No
harm
I
trust
is
done
There
might
have
been
But
that
my
master
rather
playd
than
fought
And
had
no
help
of
anger
they
were
parted
By
gentlemen
at
hand
I
am
very
glad
ont
Your
sons
my
fathers
friend
he
takes
his
part
To
draw
upon
an
exile
brave
sir
I
would
they
were
in
Afric
both
together
Myself
by
with
a
needle
that
I
might
prick
The
goerback
Why
came
you
from
your
master
On
his
command
He
would
not
suffer
me
To
bring
him
to
the
haven
left
these
notes
Of
what
commands
I
should
be
subject
to
Whent
pleasd
you
to
employ
me
This
hath
been
Your
faithful
servant
I
dare
lay
mine
honour
He
will
remain
so
I
humbly
thank
your
Highness
Pray
walk
awhile
About
some
halfhour
hence
Pray
you
speak
with
me
You
shall
at
least
Go
see
my
lord
aboard
For
this
time
leave
me
I
would
thou
grewst
unto
the
shores
o
th
haven
And
questionedst
every
sail
if
he
should
write
And
I
not
have
it
twere
a
paper
lost
As
offerd
mercy
is
What
was
the
last
That
he
spake
to
thee
It
was
his
queen
his
queen
Then
wavd
his
handkerchief
And
kissd
it
madam
Senseless
linen
happier
therein
than
I
And
that
was
all
No
madam
for
so
long
As
he
could
make
me
with
his
eye
or
care
Distinguish
him
from
others
he
did
keep
The
deck
with
glove
or
hat
or
handkerchief
Still
waving
as
the
fits
and
stirs
ofs
mind
Could
best
express
how
slow
his
soul
saild
on
How
swift
his
ship
Thou
shouldst
have
made
him
As
little
as
a
crow
or
less
ere
left
To
aftereye
him
Madam
so
I
did
I
would
have
broke
mine
eyestrings
crackd
them
but
To
look
upon
him
till
the
diminution
Of
space
had
pointed
him
sharp
as
my
needle
Nay
followed
him
till
he
had
melted
from
The
smallness
of
a
gnat
to
air
and
then
Have
turnd
mine
eye
and
wept
But
good
Pisanio
When
shall
we
hear
from
him
Be
assurd
madam
With
his
next
vantage
I
did
not
take
my
leave
of
him
but
had
Most
pretty
things
to
say
Ere
I
could
tell
him
How
I
would
think
on
him
at
certain
hours
Such
thoughts
and
such
or
I
could
make
him
swear
The
shes
of
Italy
should
not
betray
Mine
interest
and
his
honour
or
have
chargd
him
At
the
sixth
hour
of
morn
at
noon
at
midnight
encounter
me
with
orisons
for
then
I
am
in
heaven
for
him
or
ere
I
could
Give
him
that
parting
kiss
which
I
had
set
Betwixt
two
charming
words
comes
in
my
father
And
like
the
tyrannous
breathing
of
the
north
Shakes
all
our
buds
from
growing
Enter
a
The
Queen
madam
Desires
your
Highness
company
Those
things
I
bid
you
do
get
them
dispatchd
I
will
attend
the
Queen
Madam
I
shall
Whiles
yet
the
dews
on
ground
gather
those
flowers
Make
haste
who
has
the
note
of
them
I
madam
Dispatch
Now
Master
Doctor
have
you
brought
those
drugs
Pleaseth
your
Highness
ay
Here
they
are
madam
Presenting
a
box
But
I
beseech
your
Grace
without
offence
My
conscience
bids
me
ask
wherefore
you
have
Commanded
of
me
these
most
poisonous
compounds
Which
are
the
movers
of
a
languishing
death
But
though
slow
deadly
I
wonder
Doctor
Thou
askst
me
such
a
question
Have
I
not
been
Thy
pupil
long
Hast
thou
not
learnd
me
how
To
make
perfumes
distil
preserve
yea
so
That
our
great
king
himself
doth
woo
me
oft
For
my
confections
Having
thus
far
proceeded
Unless
thou
thinkst
me
devilish
ist
not
meet
That
I
did
amplify
my
judgment
in
Other
conclusions
I
will
try
the
forces
Of
these
thy
compounds
on
such
creatures
as
We
count
not
worth
the
hanging
but
none
human
To
try
the
vigour
of
them
and
apply
Allayments
to
their
act
and
by
them
gather
Their
several
virtues
and
effects
Your
Highness
Shall
from
this
practice
but
make
hard
your
heart
Besides
the
seeing
these
effects
will
be
Both
noisome
and
infectious
content
thee
Enter
Aside
Here
comes
a
flattering
rascal
upon
him
Will
I
first
work
Hes
for
his
master
An
enemy
to
my
son
How
now
Pisanio
Doctor
your
service
for
this
time
is
ended
Take
your
own
way
Aside
I
do
suspect
you
madam
But
you
shall
do
no
harm
To
Hark
thee
a
word
Aside
I
do
not
like
her
She
doth
think
she
has
Strange
lingring
poisons
I
do
know
her
spirit
And
will
not
trust
one
of
her
malice
with
drug
of
such
damnd
nature
Those
she
has
Will
stupefy
and
dull
the
sense
awhile
Which
first
perchance
shell
prove
on
cats
and
dogs
Then
afterward
up
higher
but
there
is
No
danger
in
what
show
of
death
it
makes
More
than
the
locking
up
the
spirits
a
time
To
be
more
fresh
reviving
She
is
foold
With
a
most
false
effect
and
I
the
truer
So
to
be
false
with
her
No
further
service
Doctor
Until
I
send
for
thee
I
humbly
take
my
leave
Weeps
she
still
sayst
thou
Dost
thou
think
in
time
She
will
not
quench
and
let
instructions
enter
Where
folly
now
possesses
Do
thou
work
When
thou
shalt
bring
me
word
she
loves
my
son
Ill
tell
thee
on
the
instant
thou
art
then
As
great
as
is
thy
master
greater
for
His
fortunes
all
lie
speechless
and
his
name
Is
at
last
gasp
Return
he
cannot
nor
Continue
where
he
is
To
shift
his
being
Is
to
exchange
one
misery
with
another
And
every
day
that
comes
comes
comes
to
days
work
in
him
What
shalt
thou
expect
To
be
depender
on
a
thing
that
leans
Who
cannot
be
new
built
nor
has
no
friends
So
much
as
but
to
prop
him
The
drops
the
box
takes
it
up
Thou
takst
up
Thou
knowst
not
what
but
take
it
for
thy
labour
It
is
a
thing
I
made
which
hath
the
King
Five
times
redeemd
from
death
I
do
not
know
What
is
more
cordial
Nay
I
prithee
take
it
It
is
an
earnest
of
a
further
good
That
I
mean
to
thee
Tell
thy
mistress
how
The
case
stands
with
her
dot
as
from
thyself
Think
what
a
chance
thou
changest
on
but
think
Thou
hast
thy
mistress
still
to
boot
my
son
Who
shall
take
notice
of
thee
Ill
move
the
King
To
any
shape
of
thy
preferment
such
As
thoult
desire
and
then
myself
I
chiefly
That
set
thee
on
to
this
desert
am
bound
To
load
thy
merit
richly
Call
my
women
Think
on
my
words
sly
and
constant
knave
Not
to
be
shakd
the
agent
for
his
master
And
the
remembrancer
of
her
to
hold
The
handfast
to
her
lord
I
have
given
him
that
Which
if
he
take
shall
quite
unpeople
her
Of
leigers
for
her
sweet
and
which
she
after
Except
she
bend
her
humour
shall
be
assurd
To
taste
of
too
Reenter
and
So
so
Well
done
well
done
The
violets
cowslips
and
the
primroses
Bear
to
my
closet
Fare
thee
well
Pisanio
Think
on
my
words
And
shall
do
But
when
to
my
good
lord
I
prove
untrue
Ill
choke
myself
theres
all
Ill
do
for
you
Whos
there
My
woman
Helen
Please
you
madam
What
hour
is
it
Almost
midnight
madam
I
have
read
three
hours
then
Mine
eyes
are
weak
Fold
down
the
leaf
where
I
have
left
To
bed
Take
not
away
the
taper
leave
it
burning
And
if
thou
canst
awake
by
four
o
th
clock
I
prithee
call
me
Sleep
hath
seizd
me
wholly
To
your
protection
I
commend
me
gods
From
fairies
and
the
tempters
of
the
night
Guard
me
beseech
ye
Sleeps
comes
from
the
trunk
The
crickets
sing
and
mans
oerlabourd
sense
Repairs
itself
by
rest
Our
Tarquin
thus
Did
softly
press
the
rushes
ere
he
wakend
The
chastity
he
wounded
Cytherea
How
bravely
thou
becomst
thy
bed
fresh
lily
And
whiter
than
the
sheets
That
I
might
touch
But
kiss
one
kiss
Rubies
unparagond
How
dearly
they
dot
Tis
her
breathing
that
Perfumes
the
chamber
thus
The
flame
o
th
taper
Bows
toward
her
and
would
underpeep
her
lids
To
see
th
enclosed
lights
now
canopied
Under
these
windows
white
and
azure
lacd
With
blue
of
heavens
own
tinct
But
my
design
To
note
the
chamber
I
will
write
all
down
Such
and
such
pictures
there
the
window
such
Th
adornment
of
her
bed
the
arras
figures
Why
such
and
such
and
the
contents
o
th
story
Ah
but
some
natural
notes
about
her
body
Above
ten
thousand
meaner
movables
Would
testify
t
enrich
mine
inventory
sleep
thou
ape
of
death
lie
dull
upon
her
And
be
her
sense
but
as
a
monument
Thus
in
a
chapel
lying
Come
off
come
off
Taking
off
her
bracelet
As
slippery
as
the
Gordian
knot
was
hard
Tis
mine
and
this
will
witness
outwardly
As
strongly
as
the
conscience
does
within
To
th
madding
of
her
lord
On
her
left
breast
mole
cinquespotted
like
the
crimson
drops
I
th
bottom
of
a
cowslip
Heres
a
voucher
Stronger
than
ever
law
could
make
this
secret
Will
force
him
think
I
have
pickd
the
lock
and
taen
The
treasure
of
her
honour
No
more
To
what
end
Why
should
I
write
this
down
thats
riveted
Screwd
to
my
memory
She
hath
been
reading
late
The
tale
of
Tereus
here
the
leafs
turnd
down
Where
Philomel
gave
up
I
have
enough
To
th
trunk
again
and
shut
the
spring
of
it
Swift
swift
you
dragons
of
the
night
that
dawning
May
bare
the
ravens
eye
I
lodge
in
fear
Though
this
a
heavenly
angel
hell
is
here
Clock
strikes
One
two
three
Time
time
Fear
it
not
sir
I
would
I
were
so
sure
To
win
the
King
as
I
am
bold
her
honour
Will
remain
hers
What
means
do
you
make
to
him
Not
any
but
abide
the
change
of
time
Quake
in
the
present
winters
state
and
wish
That
warmer
days
would
come
In
these
feard
hopes
I
barely
gratify
your
love
they
failing
I
must
die
much
your
debtor
Your
very
goodness
and
your
company
Oerpays
all
I
can
do
By
this
your
king
Hath
heard
of
great
Augustus
Caius
Lucius
Will
dos
commission
throughly
and
I
think
Hell
grant
the
tribute
send
th
arrearages
Or
look
upon
our
Romans
whose
remembrance
Is
yet
fresh
in
their
grief
I
do
believe
Statist
though
I
am
none
nor
like
to
be
That
this
will
prove
a
war
and
you
shall
hear
The
legions
now
in
Gallia
sooner
landed
In
our
notfearing
Britain
than
have
tidings
Of
any
penny
tribute
paid
Our
countrymen
Are
men
more
orderd
than
when
Julius
Caesar
Smild
at
their
lack
of
skill
but
found
their
courage
Worthy
his
frowning
at
Their
discipline
Now
mingled
with
their
courages
will
make
known
To
their
approvers
they
are
people
such
That
mend
upon
the
world
Enter
See
Iachimo
The
swiftest
harts
have
posted
you
by
land
And
winds
of
all
the
comers
kissd
your
sails
To
make
your
vessel
nimble
Welcome
sir
I
hope
the
briefness
of
your
answer
made
The
speediness
of
your
return
Your
lady
Is
one
of
the
fairest
that
I
have
lookd
upon
And
therewithal
the
best
or
let
her
beauty
Look
through
a
casement
to
allure
false
hearts
And
be
false
with
them
Here
are
letters
for
you
Their
tenour
good
I
trust
Tis
very
like
Was
Caius
Lucius
in
the
Britain
court
When
you
were
there
He
was
expected
then
But
not
approachd
All
is
well
yet
Sparkles
this
stone
as
it
was
wont
or
ist
not
Too
dull
for
your
good
wearing
If
I
have
lost
it
I
should
have
lost
the
worth
of
it
in
gold
Ill
make
a
journey
twice
as
far
t
enjoy
second
night
of
such
sweet
shortness
which
Was
mine
in
Britain
for
the
ring
is
won
The
stones
too
hard
to
come
by
Not
a
whit
Your
lady
being
so
easy
Make
not
sir
Your
loss
your
sport
I
hope
you
know
that
we
Must
not
continue
friends
Good
sir
we
must
If
you
keep
covenant
Had
I
not
brought
The
knowledge
of
your
mistress
home
I
grant
We
were
to
question
farther
but
I
now
Profess
myself
the
winner
of
her
honour
Together
with
your
ring
and
not
the
wronger
Of
her
or
you
having
proceeded
but
By
both
your
wills
If
you
can
maket
apparent
That
you
have
tasted
her
in
bed
my
hand
And
ring
is
yours
If
not
the
foul
opinion
You
had
of
her
pure
honour
gains
or
loses
Your
sword
or
mine
or
masterless
leaves
both
To
who
shall
find
them
Sir
my
circumstances
Being
so
near
the
truth
as
I
will
make
them
Must
first
induce
you
to
believe
whose
strength
I
will
confirm
with
oath
which
I
doubt
not
Youll
give
me
leave
to
spare
when
you
shall
find
You
need
it
not
Proceed
First
her
bedchamber
Where
I
confess
I
slept
not
but
profess
Had
that
was
well
worth
watchingit
was
hangd
With
tapestry
of
silk
and
silver
the
story
Proud
Cleopatra
when
she
met
her
Roman
And
Cydnus
swelld
above
the
banks
or
for
The
press
of
boats
or
pride
piece
of
work
So
bravely
done
so
rich
that
it
did
strive
In
workmanship
and
value
which
I
wonderd
Could
be
so
rarely
and
exactly
wrought
Since
the
true
life
ont
was
This
is
true
And
this
you
might
have
heard
of
here
by
me
Or
by
some
other
More
particulars
Must
justify
my
knowledge
So
they
must
Or
do
your
honour
injury
The
chimney
Is
south
the
chamber
and
the
chimneypiece
Chaste
Dian
bathing
Never
saw
I
figures
So
likely
to
report
themselves
The
cutter
Was
as
another
nature
dumb
outwent
her
Motion
and
breath
left
out
This
is
a
thing
Which
you
might
from
relation
likewise
reap
Being
as
it
is
much
spoke
of
The
roof
o
th
chamber
With
golden
cherubins
is
fretted
her
andirons
I
had
forgot
them
were
two
winking
Cupids
Of
silver
each
on
one
foot
standing
nicely
Depending
on
their
brands
This
is
her
honour
Let
it
be
granted
you
have
seen
all
this
and
praise
Be
given
to
your
remembrance
the
description
Of
what
is
in
her
chamber
nothing
saves
The
wager
you
have
laid
Then
if
you
can
Shows
the
bracelet
Be
pale
I
beg
but
leave
to
air
this
jewel
See
And
now
tis
up
again
It
must
be
married
To
that
your
diamond
Ill
keep
them
Jove
Once
more
let
me
behold
it
Is
it
that
Which
I
left
with
her
Sir
I
thank
her
that
She
strippd
it
from
her
arm
I
see
her
yet
Her
pretty
action
did
outsell
her
gift
And
yet
enrichd
it
too
She
gave
it
me
and
said
She
prizd
it
once
May
be
she
pluckd
it
of
To
send
it
me
She
writes
so
to
you
doth
she
no
no
no
tis
true
Here
take
this
too
Gives
the
ring
It
is
a
basilisk
unto
mine
eye
Kills
me
to
look
ont
Let
there
be
no
honour
Where
there
is
beauty
truth
where
semblance
love
Where
theres
another
man
The
vows
of
women
Of
no
more
bondage
be
to
where
they
are
made
Than
they
are
to
their
virtues
which
is
nothing
above
measure
false
Have
patience
sir
And
take
your
ring
again
tis
not
yet
won
It
may
be
probable
she
lost
it
or
Who
knows
if
one
her
women
being
corrupted
Hath
stoln
it
from
her
Very
true
And
so
I
hope
he
came
byt
Back
my
ring
Render
to
me
some
corporal
sign
about
her
More
evident
than
this
for
this
was
stoln
By
Jupiter
I
had
it
from
her
arm
Hark
you
he
swears
by
Jupiter
he
swears
Tis
true
nay
keep
the
ring
tis
true
I
am
sure
She
would
not
lose
it
Her
attendants
are
All
sworn
and
honourable
they
inducd
to
steal
it
And
by
a
stranger
No
he
hath
enjoyd
her
The
cognizance
of
her
incontinency
Is
this
she
hath
bought
the
name
of
whore
thus
dearly
There
take
thy
hire
and
all
the
fiends
of
hell
Divide
themselves
between
you
Sir
be
patient
This
is
not
strong
enough
to
be
believd
Of
one
persuaded
well
of
Never
talk
ont
She
hath
been
colted
by
him
If
you
seek
For
further
satisfying
under
her
breast
Worthy
the
pressing
lies
a
mole
right
proud
Of
that
most
delicate
lodging
By
my
life
I
kissd
it
and
it
gave
me
present
hunger
To
feed
again
though
full
You
do
remember
This
stain
upon
her
Ay
and
it
doth
confirm
Another
stain
as
big
as
hell
can
hold
Were
there
no
more
but
it
Will
you
hear
more
Spare
your
arithmetic
never
count
the
turns
Once
and
a
million
Ill
be
sworn
No
swearing
If
you
will
swear
you
have
not
donet
you
lie
And
I
will
kill
thee
if
thou
dost
deny
Thoust
made
me
cuckold
Ill
deny
nothing
that
I
had
her
here
to
tear
her
limbmeal
I
will
go
there
and
dot
i
th
court
before
Her
father
Ill
do
something
Quite
besides
The
government
of
patience
You
have
won
Lets
follow
him
and
pervert
the
present
wrath
He
hath
against
himself
With
all
my
heart
How
of
adultery
Wherefore
write
you
not
What
monsters
her
accuse
Leonatus
master
what
a
strange
infection
Is
falln
into
thy
ear
What
false
Italian
As
poisonoustongud
as
handed
hath
prevaild
On
thy
too
ready
hearing
Disloyal
No
Shes
punishd
for
her
truth
and
undergoes
More
goddesslike
than
wifelike
such
assaults
As
would
take
in
some
virtue
my
master
Thy
mind
to
her
is
now
as
low
as
were
Thy
fortunes
How
that
I
should
murder
her
Upon
the
love
and
truth
and
vows
which
I
Have
made
to
thy
command
I
her
Her
blood
If
it
be
so
to
do
good
service
never
Let
me
be
counted
serviceable
How
look
I
That
I
should
seem
to
lack
humanity
So
much
as
this
fact
comes
to
Reads
Dot
The
letter
That
I
have
sent
her
by
her
own
command
Shall
give
thee
opportunity
damnd
paper
Black
as
the
ink
thats
on
thee
Senseless
bauble
Art
thou
a
fedary
for
this
act
and
lookst
So
virginlike
without
Lo
here
she
comes
Enter
I
am
ignorant
in
what
I
am
commanded
How
now
Pisanio
Madam
here
is
a
letter
from
my
lord
Who
thy
lord
That
is
my
lord
Leonatus
learnd
indeed
were
that
astronomer
That
knew
the
stars
as
I
his
characters
Hed
lay
the
future
open
You
good
gods
Let
what
is
here
containd
relish
of
love
Of
my
lords
health
of
his
content
yet
not
That
we
two
are
asunder
let
that
grieve
him
Some
griefs
are
medcinable
that
is
one
of
them
For
it
doth
physic
love
of
his
content
All
but
in
that
Good
wax
thy
leave
Blest
be
You
bees
that
make
these
locks
of
counsel
Lovers
And
men
in
dangerous
bonds
pray
not
alike
Though
forfeiters
you
cast
in
prison
yet
You
clasp
young
Cupids
tables
Good
news
gods
Reads
Justice
and
your
fathers
wrath
should
he
take
me
in
his
dominion
could
not
be
so
cruel
to
me
as
you
the
dearest
of
creatures
would
even
renew
me
with
your
eyes
Take
notice
that
I
am
in
Cambria
at
Milford
Haven
What
your
own
love
will
out
of
this
advise
you
follow
So
he
wishes
you
all
happiness
that
remains
loyal
to
his
vow
and
your
increasing
in
love
for
a
horse
with
wings
Hearst

Read

How

If

Who

But

a
fainter
kind
not
like
me
For
mines
beyond

Loves

fill
the
bores
of

To
th
smothering
of
the
sense
how

To
this

Milford
And
by

way
Tell

how
Wales

But

How

steal
from

and
for
the
gap
That

from
our
hencegoing
And
our
return
to

But

hence
Why

Well

Prithee

How

Twixt

Where

That

But

Go

That

Wherefore
breaks
that
sigh
From
th
inward
of

One
but
painted

Would
be
interpreted
a
thing
perplexd
Beyond
selfexplication
Put
thyself
Into
a
haviour
of
less
fear
ere
wildness
Vanquish
my
staider
senses
Whats

Why
tenderst

Ift

Smile

But

My

That

And

Speak

May
take

extremity
which
to

Would

Please

And
you
shall
find

The
most
disdaind
of

Reads
Thy
mistress
Pisanio
hath
playd
the
strumpet
in
my
bed
the
testimonies
whereof
lie
bleeding
in
me
I
speak
not
out
of
weak
surmises
but
from
proof
as
strong
as
my
grief
and
as
certain
as
I
expect
my
revenge
That
part
thou
Pisanio
must
act
for
me
if
thy
faith
be
not
tainted
with
the
breach
of
hers
Let
thine
own
hands
take
away
her
life
I
shall
give
thee
opportunity
at
Milford
Haven
she
hath
my
letter
for
the
purpose
where
if
thou
fear
to
strike
and
to
make
me
certain
it
is
done
thou
art
the
pander
to
her
dishonour
and
equally
to
me
disloyal
What
shall
I
need
to
draw
my
sword
The
paper
Hath
cut
her
throat
already
No
tis
slander
Whose
edge
is
sharper
than
the
sword
whose
tongue
Outvenoms
all
the
worms
of
Nile
whose
breath
Rides
on
the
posting
winds
and
doth
belie
All
corners
of
the
world
Kings
queens
and
states
Maids
matrons
nay
the
secrets
of
the
grave
This
viperous
slander
enters
What
cheer
madam
False
to
his
bed
What
is
it
to
be
false
To
lie
in
watch
there
and
to
think
on
him
To
weep
twixt
clock
and
clock
If
sleep
charge
nature
To
break
it
with
a
fearful
dream
of
him
And
cry
myself
awake
Thats
false
tos
bed
Is
it
Alas
good
lady
I
false
Thy
conscience
witness
Iachimo
Thou
didst
accuse
him
of
incontinency
Thou
then
lookdst
like
a
villain
now
methinks
Thy
favours
good
enough
Some
jay
of
Italy
Whose
mother
was
her
painting
hath
betrayd
him
Poor
I
am
stale
a
garment
out
of

And
for
I
am
richer
than
to
hang
by

walls
I
must
be
rippd
To
pieces
with

Mens
vows
are
womens
traitors
All
good
seeming
By
thy
revolt
husband

be

Put

for
villainy
not
born
wheret
grows
But
worn
a
bait
for
ladies
Good
madam
hear
me
True
honest
men
being
heard
like
false
Aeneas
Were
in
his
time
thought
false
and
Sinons
weeping
Did
scandal
many
a
holy
tear
took
pity
From
most
true
wretchedness
So
thou
Posthumus
Wilt
lay
the
leaven
on
all
proper
men
Goodly
and
gallant
shall
be
false
and
perjurd
From
thy
great
fail
Come
fellow
be
thou
honest
Do
thou
thy
masters
bidding
when
thou
seest
him
little
witness
my
obedience
Look
I
draw
the
sword
myself
take
it
and
hit
The
innocent
mansion
of
my
love
my
heart
Fear
not
tis
empty
of
all
things
but
grief
Thy
master
is
not
there
who
was
indeed
The
riches
of
it
Do
his
bidding
strike
Thou
mayst
be
valiant
in
a
better
cause
But
now
thou
seemst
a
coward
Hence
vile
instrument
Thou
shalt
not
damn
my
hand
Why
I
must
die
And
if
I
do
not
by
thy
hand
thou
art
No
servant
of
thy
masters
Against
selfslaughter
There
is
a
prohibition
so
divine
That
cravens
my
weak
hand
Come
heres
my
heart
Somethings
aforet
Soft
soft
well
no
defence
Obedient
as
the
scabbard
What
is
here
The
scriptures
of
the
loyal
Leonatus
All
turnd
to
heresy
Away
away
Corrupters
of
my
faith
you
shall
no
more
Be
stomachers
to
my
heart
Thus
may
poor
fools
Believe
false
teachers
though
those
that
are
betrayd
Do
feel
the
treason
sharply
yet
the
traitor
Stands
in
worse
case
of
woe
And
thou
Posthumus
That
didst
set
up
my
disobedience
gainst
the
King
My
father
and
make
me
put
into
contempt
the
suits
Of
princely
fellows
shalt
hereafter
find
It
is
no
act
of
common
passage
but
strain
of
rareness
and
I
grieve
myself
To
think
when
thou
shalt
be
disedgd
by
her
That
now
thou
tirest
on
how
thy
memory
Will
then
be
pangd
by
me
Prithee
dispatch
The
lamp
entreats
the
butcher
Wheres
thy
knife
Thou
art
too
slow
to
do
thy
masters
bidding
When
I
desire
it
too
gracious
lady
Since
I
receivd
command
to
do
this
busines
I
have
not
slept
one
wink
Dot
and
to
bed
then
Ill
wake
mine
eyeballs
first
Wherefore
then
Didst
undertake
it
Why
hast
thou
abusd
So
many
miles
with
a
pretence
This
place
Mine
action
and
thine
own
our
horses
labour
The
time
inviting
thee
the
perturbd
court
For
my
being
absent
whereunto
I
never
Purpose
return
Why
hast
thou
gone
so
far
To
be
unbent
when
thou
hast
taen
thy
stand
Th
elected
deer
before
thee
But
to
win
time
To
lose
so
bad
employment
in
the
which
I
have
considerd
of
a
course
Good
lady
Hear
me
with
patience
Talk
thy
tongue
weary
speak
I
have
heard
I
am
a
strumpet
and
mine
ear
Therein
false
struck
can
take
no
greater
wound
Nor
tent
to
bottom
that
But
speak
Then
madam
I
thought
you
would
not
back
again
Most
like
Bringing
me
here
to
kill
me
Not
so
neither
But
if
I
were
as
wise
as
honest
then
My
purpose
would
prove
well
It
cannot
be
But
that
my
master
is
abusd
Some
villain
Ay
and
singular
in
his
art
hath
done
you
both
This
cursed
injury
Some
Roman
courtezan
No
on
my
life
Ill
give
but
notice
you
are
dead
and
send
him
Some
bloody
sign
of
it
for
tis
commanded
I
should
do
so
You
shall
be
missd
at
court
And
that
will
well
confirm
it
Why
good
fellow
What
shall
I
do
the
while
where
bide
how
live
Or
in
my
life
what
comfort
when
I
am
Dead
to
my
husband
If
youll
back
to
th
court
No
court
no
father
nor
no
more
ado
With
that
harsh
noble
simple
nothing
That
Cloten
whose
lovesuit
hath
been
to
me
As
fearful
as
a
siege
If
not
at
court
Then
not
in
Britain
must
you
bide
Where
then
Hath
Britain
all
the
sun
that
shines
Day
night
Are
they
not
but
in
Britain
I
th
worlds
volume
Our
Britain
seems
as
of
it
but
not
int
In
a
great
pool
a
swans
nest
Prithee
think
Theres
livers
out
of
Britain
I
am
most
glad
You
think
of
other
place
Th
ambassador
the
Roman
comes
to
Milford
Haven
Tomorrow
Now
if
you
could
wear
a
mind
Dark
as
your
fortune
is
and
but
disguise
That
which
t
appear
itself
must
not
yet
be
But
by
selfdanger
you
should
tread
a
course
Pretty
and
full
of
view
yea
happily
near
The
residence
of
Posthumus
so
nigh
at
least
That
though
his
actions
were
not
visible
yet
Report
should
render
him
hourly
to
your
ear
As
truly
as
he
moves
for
such
means
Though
peril
to
my
modesty
not
death
ont
I
would
adventure
Well
then
heres
the
point
You
must
forget
to
be
a
woman
change
Command
into
obedience
fear
and
niceness
The
handmaids
of
all
women
or
more
truly
Woman
it
pretty
self
into
a
waggish
courage
Ready
in
gibes
quickanswerd
saucy
and
As
quarrelous
as
the
weasel
Nay
you
must
Forget
that
rarest
treasure
of
your
cheek
Exposing
it
but
the
harder
heart
Alack
no
remedy
to
the
greedy
touch
Of
commonkissing
Titan
and
forget
Your
laboursome
and
dainty
trims
wherein
You
made
great
Juno
angry
Nay
be
brief
I
see
into
thy
end
and
am
almost
man
already
First
make
yourself
but
like
one
Forethinking
this
I
have
already
fit
Tis
in
my
cloakbag
doublet
hat
hose
all
That
answer
to
them
Would
you
in
their
serving
And
with
what
imitation
you
can
borrow
From
youth
of
such
a
season
fore
noble
Lucius
Present
yourself
desire
his
service
tell
him
Wherein
youre
happy
which
will
make
him
know
If
that
his
head
have
ear
in
music
doubtless
With
joy
he
will
embrace
you
for
hes
honourable
And
doubling
that
most
holy
Your
means
abroad
You
have
me
rich
and
I
will
never
fail
Beginning
nor
supplyment
Thou
art
all
the
comfort
The
gods
will
diet
me
with
Prithee
away
Theres
more
to
be
considerd
but
well
even
All
that
good
time
will
give
us
This
attempt
I
am
soldier
to
and
will
abide
it
with
princes
courage
Away
I
prithee
Well
madam
we
must
take
a
short
farewell
Lest
being
missd
I
be
suspected
of
Your
carriage
from
the
court
My
noble
mistress
Here
is
a
box
I
had
it
from
the
Queen
Whats
int
is
precious
If
you
are
sick
at
sea
Or
stomachqualmd
at
land
a
dram
of
this
Will
drive
away
distemper
To
some
shade
And
fit
you
to
your
manhood
May
the
gods
Direct
you
to
the
best
Amen
I
thank
thee
I
see
a
mans
life
is
a
tedious
one
I
have
tird
myself
and
for
two
nights
together
Have
made
the
ground
my
bed
I
should
be
sick
But
that
my
resolution
helps
me
Milford
When
from
the
mountaintop
Pisanio
showd
thee
Thou
wast
within
a
ken
Jove
I
think
Foundations
fly
the
wretched
such
I
mean
Where
they
should
be
relievd
Two
beggars
told
me
I
could
not
miss
my
way
Will
poor
folks
lie
That
have
afflictions
on
them
knowing
tis
punishment
or
trial
Yes
no
wonder
When
rich
ones
scarce
tell
true
To
lapse
in
fulness
Is
sorer
than
to
lie
for
need
and
falsehood
Is
worse
in
kings
than
beggars
My
dear
lord
Thou
art
one
o
th
false
ones
Now
I
think
on
thee
My
hungers
gone
but
even
before
I
was
At
point
to
sink
for
food
But
what
is
this
Here
is
a
path
tot
tis
some
savage
hold
I
were

not

I
dare
not
call
Yet

Ere

nature
makes
it
valiant
Plenty
and

Of
hardiness

Ho

If
anything
thats
civil

if
savage
Take
or
lend
Ho
No

Then
Ill
enter
Best

sword
and

But
fear
the
sword
like

Such

Enter
and
You
Polydore
have
provd
best
woodman
and
Are
master
of
the
feast
Cadwal
and
I
Will
play
the
cook
and
servant
tis
our
match
The
sweat
of
industry
would
dry
and
die
But
for
the
end
it
works
to
Come
our
stomachs
Will
make
whats
homely

Can

Finds

Now

Poor

To

This
youth
howeer
distressd
appears
he
hath
had
Good
ancestors
How
angellike
he
sings
But
his
neat
cookery
He
cut
our
roots
in
characters
And
saucd
our
broths
as
Juno
had
been
sick
And
he
her
dieter
Nobly
he
yokes
smiling
with
a
sigh
as
if
the
sigh
Was
that
it
was
for
not
being
such
a
smile
The
smile
mocking
the
sigh
that
it
would
fly
From
so
divine
a
temple
to
commix
With
winds
that
sailors
rail
at
I
do
note
That
grief
and
patience
rooted
in
him
both
Mingle
their
spurs
together
Grow
patience
And
let
the
stinking
elder
grief
untwine
His
perishing
root
with
the
increasing
vine
It
is
great
morning
Come

Whos

Enter

Hath

Hence
He

Let

cannot
tremble
at
it
Were
it
toad
or
adder
spider
Twould
move
me
sooner
To
thy
further
fear
Nay
to
thy
mere
confusion
thou
shalt
know
I
am
son
to
th
Queen
Im
sorry
fort
not
seeming
So
worthy
as
thy
birth
Art
not
afeard
Those
that
I
reverence
those
I
fear
the
wise
At
fools
I
laugh
not
fear
them
Die
the
death
When
I
have
slain
thee
with
my
proper
hand
Ill
follow
those
that
even
now
fled
hence
And
on
the
gates
of
Luds
Town
set
your
heads
Yield
rustic
mountaineer
Reenter
and
No
companys
abroad
None
in
the
world
you
did
mistake
him
sure
I
cannot
tell
long
is
it
since
I
saw
him
But
time
hath
nothing
blurrd
those
lines
of
favour
Which
then
he
wore
the
snatches
in
his
voice
And
burst
of
speaking
were
as
his
I
am
absolute
Twas
very
Cloten
In
this
place
we
left
them
I
wish
my
brother
make
good
time
with
him
You
say
he
is
so
fell
Being
scarce
made
up
I
mean
to
man
he
had
not
apprehension
Or
roaring
terrors
for
defect
of
judgment
Is
oft
the
cease
of
fear
Reenter
with
head
But
see
thy
brother
This
Cloten
was
a
fool
an
empty
purse
There
was
no
money
int
Not
Hercules
Could
have
knockd
out
his
brains
for
he
had
none
Yet
I
not
doing
this
the
fool
had
borne
My
head
as
I
do
his
What
hast
thou
done
I
am
perfect
what
cut
off
one
Clotens
head
Son
to
the
Queen
after
his
own
report
Who
calld
me
traitor
mountaineer
and
swore
With
his
own
single
hand
hed
take
us
in
Displace
our
heads
where
thank
the
gods
they
grow
And
set
them
on
Luds
Town
We
are
all
undone
Why
worthy
father
what
have
we
to
lose
But
that
he
swore
to
take
our
lives
The
law
Protects
not
us
then
why
should
we
be
tender
To
let
an
arrogant
piece
of
flesh
threat
us
Play
judge
and
executioner
all
himself
For
we
do
fear
the
law
What
company
Discover
you
abroad
No
single
soul
Can
we
set
eye
on
but
in
an
safe
reason
He
must
have
some
attendants
Though
his
humour
Was
nothing
but
mutation
ay
and
that
From
one
bad
thing
to
worse
not
frenzy
not
Absolute
madness
could
so
far
have
ravd
To
bring
him
here
alone
Although
perhaps
It
may
be
heard
at
court
that
such
as
we
Cave
here
hunt
here
are
outlaws
and
in
time
May
make
some
stronger
head
the
which
he
hearing
As
it
is
like
him
might
break
out
and
swear
Hed
fetch
us
in
yet
ist
not
probable
To
come
alone
either
he
so
undertaking
Or
they
so
suffering
Then
on
good
ground
we
fear
If
we
do
fear
this
body
hath
a
tail
More
perilous
than
the
head
Let
ordinance
Come
as
the
gods
foresay
it
Howsoeer
My
brother
hath
done
well
I
had
no
mind
To
hunt
this
day
the
boy
Fideles
sickness
Did
make
my
way
long
forth
With
his
own
sword
Which
he
did
wave
against
my
throat
I
have
taen
His
head
from
him
Ill
throwt
into
the
creek
Behind
our
rock
and
let
it
to
the
sea
And
tell
the
fishes
hes
the
Queens
son
Cloten
Thats
all
I
reck
I
feartwill
be
revengd
Would
Polydore
thou
hadst
not
donet
though
valour
Becomes
thee
well
enough
Would
I
had
donet
So
the
revenge
alone
pursud
me
Polydore
I
love
thee
brotherly
but
envy
much
Thou
hast
robbd
me
of
this
deed
I
would
revenges
That
possible
strength
might
meet
would
seek
us
through
And
put
us
to
our
answer
Well
tis
done
Well
hunt
no
more
today
nor
seek
for
danger
Where
theres
no
profit
I
prithee
to
our
rock
You
and
Fidele
play
the
cooks
Ill
stay
Till
hasty
Polydore
return
and
bring
him
To
dinner
presently
Poor
sick
Fidele
Ill
willingly
to
him
to
gain
his
colour
Id
let
a
parish
of
such
Clotens
blood
And
praise
myself
for
charity
thou
goddess
Thou
divine
Nature
thou
thyself
thou
blazonst
In
these
two
princely
boys
They
are
as
gentle
As
zephyrs
blowing
below
the
violet
Not
wagging
his
sweet
head
and
yet
as
rough
Their
royal
blood
enchafd
as
the
rudst
wind
That
by
the
top
doth
take
the
mountain
pine
And
make
him
stoop
to
th
vale
Tis
wonder
That
an
invisible
instinct
should
frame
them
To
royalty
unlearnd
honour
untaught
Civility
not
seen
from
other
valour
That
wildly
grows
in
them
but
yields
a
crop
As
if
it
had
been
sowd
Yet
still
its
strange
What
Clotens
being
here
to
us
portends
Or
what
his
death
will
bring
us
Reenter
Wheres
my
brother
I
have
sent
Clotens
clotpoll
down
the
stream
In
embassy
to
his
mother
his
bodys
hostage
For
his
return
Solemn
music
My
ingenious
instrument
Hark
Polydore
it
sounds
But
what
occasion
Hath
Cadwal
now
to
give
it
motion
Hark
Is
he
at
home
He
went
hence
even
now
What
does
he
mean
Since
death
of
my
dearst
mother
It
did
not
speak
before
All
solemn
things
Should
answer
solemn
accidents
The
matter
Triumphs
for
nothing
and
lamenting
toys
Is
jollity
for
apes
and
grief
for
boys
Is
Cadwal
mad
Reenter
with
as
dead
bearing
her
in
his
arms
Look
here
he
comes
And
brings
the
dire
occasion
in
his
arms
Of
what
we
blame
him
for
The
bird
is
dead
That
we
have
made
so
much
on
I
had
rather
Have
skippd
from
sixteen
years
of
age
to
sixty
To
have
turnd
my
leaping
time
into
a
crutch
Than
have
seen
this
sweetest
fairest
lily
My
brother
wears
thee
not
the
one
half
so
well
As
when
thou
grewst
thyself
melancholy
Who
ever
yet
could
sound
thy
bottom
find
The
ooze
to
show
what
coast
thy
sluggish
crare
Mightst
easiliest
harbour
in
Thou
blessed
thing
Jove
knows
what
man
thou
mightst
have
made
but
I
Thou
diedst
a
most
rare
boy
of
melancholy
How
found
you
him
Stark
as
you
see
Thus
smiling
as
some
fly
had
tickled
slumber
Not
as
deaths
dart
being
laughd
at
his
right
cheek
Reposing
on
a
cushion
Where
th
floor
His
arms
thus
leagud
I
thought
he
slept
and
put
My
clouted
brogues
from
off
my
feet
whose
rudeness
Answerd
my
steps
too
loud
Why
he
but
sleeps
If
he
be
gone
hell
make
his
grave
a
bed
With
female
fairies
will
his
tomb
be
haunted
And
worms
will
not
come
to
thee
With
fairest
flowers
Whilst
summer
lasts
and
I
live
here
Fidele
Ill
sweeten
thy
sad
grave
Thou
shalt
not
lack
The
flower
thats
like
thy
face
pale
primrose
nor
The
azurd
harebell
like
thy
veins
no
nor
The
leaf
of
eglantine
whom
not
to
slander
Outsweetned
not
thy
breath
The
ruddock
would
With
charitable
bill
bill
sore
shaming
Those
richleft
heirs
that
let
their
fathers
lie
Without
a
monument
bring
thee
all
this
Yea
and
furrd
moss
besides
when
flowrs
are
none
To
winterground
thy
corse
Prithee
have
done
And
do
not
play
in
wenchlike
words
with
that
Which
is
so
serious
Let
us
bury
him
And
not
protract
with
admiration
what
Is
now
due
debt
To
th
grave
Say
where
shalls
lay
him
By
good
Euriphile
our
mother
Bet
so
And
let
us
Polydore
though
now
our
voices
Have
got
the
mannish
crack
sing
him
to
th
ground
As
once
to
our
mother
use
like
note
and
words
Save
that
Euriphile
must
be
Fidele
Cadwal
I
cannot
sing
Ill
weep
and
word
it
with
thee
For
notes
of
sorrow
out
of
tune
are
worse
Than
priests
and
fanes
that
lie
Well
speak
it
then
Great
griefs
I
see
medcine
the
less
for
Cloten
Is
quite
forgot
He
was
a
queens
son
boys
And
though
he
came
our
enemy
remember
He
was
paid
for
that
Though
mean
and
mighty
rotting
Together
have
one
dust
yet
reverence
That
angel
of
the
world
doth
make
distinction
Of
place
tween
high
and
low
Our
foe
was
princely
And
though
you
took
his
life
as
being
our
foe
Yet
bury
him
as
a
prince
Pray
you
fetch
him
hither
Thersites
body
is
as
good
as
Ajax
When
neither
are
alive
If
youll
go
fetch
him
Well
say
our
song
the
whilst
Brother
begin
Nay
Cadwal
we
must
lay
his
head
to
th
East
My
father
hath
a
reason

Tis
true
Come
on
then
and
remove
him
So
Begin
Fear
no
more
the
heat
o
th
sun
Nor
the
furious
winters
rages
Thou
thy
worldly
task
hast
done
Home

gone
and
taen
thy
wages
Golden
lads
and
girls
all

As
chimneysweepers

Fear

frown
o

Thou

past
the
tyrants

Care
no
more
to

and
eat
To
thee
the
reed
is
as
the
oak
The
sceptre
learning

All
follow
this
and
come
to
dust
Fear
no
more
the
lightning
flash
Nor
th
alldreaded
thunderstone
Fear
not
slander
censure

Thou
hast
finishd
joy
and

All
lovers

all

Consign
to
thee
and
come

No

Nor
no

Ghost

Nothing

Quiet

And

thy
grave
Reenter
with
the
body
of
We
have
done
our
obsequies
Come
lay
him
down
Heres
a
few
flowers
but
bout
midnight
more
The
herbs
that
have
on
them
cold
dew
o
th
night
Are
strewings
fitst
for
graves
Upon
their
faces
You
were
as
flowrs
now
witherd
Even
so
These
herblets
shall
which
we
upon
you
strew
Come
on
away
Apart
upon
our
knees
The
ground
that
gave
them
first
has
them
again
Their
pleasures
here
are
past
so
is
their
pain
Awaking
Yes
sir
to
Milford
Haven
Which
is
the
way
I
thank
you
By
yond
bush
Pray
how
far
thither
Ods
pittikins
can
it
be
six
mile
yet
I
have
gone
all
night
Faith
Ill
lie
down
and
sleep
But
soft
no
bedfellow
gods
and
goddesses
Seeing
the
body
These
flowrs
are
like
the
pleasures
of
the
world
This
bloody
man
the
care
ont
I
hope
I
dream
For
so
I
thought
I
was
a
cavekeeper
And
cook
to
honest
creatures
But
tis
not
so
Twas
but
a
bolt
of
nothing
shot
at
nothing
Which
the
brain
makes
of
fumes
Our
very
eyes
Are
sometimes
like
our
judgments
blind
Good
faith
I
tremble
still
with
fear
but
if
there
be
Yet
left
in
heaven
as
small
a
drop
of
pity
As
a
wrens
eye
feard

a
part
of

The

Even
when
I

Without

The

Murder

All

And

Tis

This

Give

That

Now
sir
What
have
you
dreamd
of
late
of
this
wars
purpose
Last
night
the
very
gods
showd
me
a
vision
I
fast
and
prayd
for
their
intelligence
thus
I
saw
Joves
bird
the
Roman
eagle
wingd
From
the
spongy
south
to
this
part
of
the
west
There
vanishd
in
the
sunbeams
which
portends
Unless
my
sins
abuse
my
divination
Success
to
th
Roman
host
Dream
often
so
And
never
false
Soft
ho
what
trunk
is
here
Without
his
top
The
ruin
speaks
that
sometime
It
was
a
worthy
building
How
a
page
Or
dead
or
sleeping
on
him
But
dead
rather
For
nature
doth
abhor
to
make
his
bed
With
the
defunct
or
sleep
upon
the
dead
Lets
see
the
boys
face
Hes
alive
my
lord
Hell
then
instruct
us
of
this
body
Young
one
Inform
us
of
thy
fortunes
for
it
seems
They
crave
to
be
demanded
Who
is
this
Thou
makst
thy
bloody
pillow
Or
who
was
he
That
otherwise
than
noble
nature
did
Hath
alterd
that
good
picture
Whats
thy
interest
In
this
sad
wreck
How
camet
Who
ist
What
art
thou
I
am
nothing
or
if
not
Nothing
to
be
were
better
This
was
my
master
very
valiant
Briton
and
a
good
That
here
by
mountaineers
lies
slain
Alas
There
is
no
more
such
masters
I
may
wander
From
east
to
occident
cry
out
for
service
Try
many
all
good
serve
truly
never
Find
such
another
master
Lack
good
youth
Thou
movst
no
less
with
thy
complaining
than
Thy
master
in
bleeding
Say
his
name
good
friend
Richard
du
Champ
Aside
If
I
do
lie
and
do
No
harm
by
it
though
the
gods
hear
I
hope
Theyll
pardon
it
Say
you
sir
Thy
name
Fidele
sir
Thou
dost
approve
thyself
the
very
same
Thy
name
well
fits
thy
faith
thy
faith
thy
name
Wilt
take
thy
chance
with
me
I
will
not
say
Thou
shalt
be
so
well
masterd
but
be
sure
No
less
belovd
The
Roman
Emperors
letters
Sent
by
a
consul
to
me
should
not
sooner
Than
thine
own
worth
prefer
thee
Go
with
me
Ill
follow
sir
But
first
ant
please
the
gods
Ill
hide
my
master
from
the
flies
as
deep
As
these
poor
pickaxes
can
dig
and
when
With
wild
woodleaves
and
weeds
I
ha
strewd
his
grave
And
on
it
said
a
century
of
prayers
Such
as
I
can
twice
oer
Ill
weep
and
sigh
And
leaving
so
his
service
follow
you
So
please
you
entertain
me
Ay
good
youth
And
rather
father
thee
than
master
thee
My
friends
The
boy
hath
taught
us
manly
duties
let
us
Find
out
the
prettiest
daisied
plot
we
can
And
make
him
with
our
pikes
and
partisans
grave
Come
arm
him
Boy
he
is
preferrd
By
thee
to
us
and
he
shall
be
interrd
As
soldiers
can
Be
cheerful
wipe
thine
eyes
Some
falls
are
means
the
happier
to
arise
The
noise
is
round
about
us
Let
us
from
it
What
pleasure
sir
find
we
in
life
to
lock
it
From
action
and
adventure
Nay
what
hope
Have
we
in
hiding
us
This
way
the
Romans
Must
or
for
Britons
slay
us
or
receive
us
For
barbarous
and
unnatural
revolts
During
their
use
and
slay
us
after
Sons
Well
higher
to
the
mountains
there
secure
us
To
the
Kings
party
theres
no
going
Newness
Of
Clotens
death
we
being
not
known
not
musterd
Among
the
bandsmay
drive
us
to
a
render
Where
we
have
livd
and
so
extort
froms
that
Which
we
have
done
whose
answer
would
be
death
Drawn
on
with
torture
This
is
sir
a
doubt
In
such
a
time
nothing
becoming
you
Nor
satisfying
us
It
is
not
likely
That
when
they
hear
the
Roman
horses
neigh
Behold
their
quarterd
fires
have
both
their
eyes
And
ears
so
cloyd
importantly
as
now
That
they
will
waste
their
time
upon
our
note
To
know
from
whence
we
are
I
am
known
Of
many
in
the
army
Many
years
Though
Cloten
then
but
young
you
see
not
wore
him
From
my
remembrance
And
besides
the
King
Hath
not
deservd
my
service
nor
your
loves
Who
find
in
my
exile
the
want
of
breeding
The
certainty
of
this
hard
life
aye
hopeless
To
have
the
courtesy
your
cradle
promisd
But
to
be
still
hot
summers
tanlings
and
The
shrinking
slaves
of
winter
Than
be
so
Better
to
cease
to
be
Pray
sir
to
th
army
I
and
my
brother
are
not
known
yourself
So
out
of
thought
and
thereto
so
oergrown
Cannot
be
questioned
By
this
sun
that
shines
Ill
thither
What
thing
ist
that
I
never
Did
see
man
die
scarce
ever
lookd
on
blood
But
that
of
coward
hares
hot
goats
and
venison
Never
bestrid
a
horse
save
one
that
had
rider
like
myself
who
neer
wore
rowel
Nor
iron
on
his
heel
I
am
ashamd
To
look
upon
the
holy
sun
to
have
The
benefit
of
his
blest
beams
remaining
So
long
a
poor
unknown
By
heavens
Ill
go
If
you
will
bless
me
sir
and
give
me
leave
Ill
take
the
better
care
but
if
you
will
not
The
hazard
therefore
due
fall
on
me
by
The
hands
of
Romans
So
say
I
Amen
No
reason
I
since
of
your
lives
you
set
So
slight
a
valuation
should
reserve
My
crackd
one
to
more
care
Have
with
you
boys
If
in
your
country
wars
you
chance
to
die
That
is
my
bed
too
lads
and
there
Ill
lie
Lead
lead
Aside
The
time
seems
long
their
blood
thinks
scorn
Till
it
fly
out
and
show
them
princes
born
I
Britain
The
Roman
camp
Enter
alone
with
a
bloody
handkerchief
Yea
bloody
cloth
Ill
keep
thee
for
I
wishd
Thou
shouldst
be
colourd
thus
You
married
ones
If
each
of
you
should
take
this
course
how
many
Must
murder
wives
much
better
than
themselves
For
wrying
but
a
little
Pisanio
Every
good
servant
does
not
all
commands
No
bond
but
to
do
just
ones
Gods
if
you
Should
have
taen
vengeance
on
my
faults
I
never
Had
livd
to
put
on
this
so
had
you
saved
The
noble
Imogen
to
repent
and
struck
Me
wretch
more
worth
your
vengeance
But
alack
You
snatch
some
hence
for
little
faults
thats
love
To
have
them
fall
no
more
You
some
permit
To
second
ills
with
ills
each
elder
worse
And
make
them
dread
it
to
the
doers
thrift
But
Imogen
is
your
own
Do
your
best
wills
And
make
me
blest
to
obey
I
am
brought
hither
Among
th
Italian
gentry
and
to
fight
Against
my
ladys
kingdom
Tis
enough
That
Britain
I
have
killd
thy
mistress
peace
Ill
give
no
wound
to
thee
Therefore
good
heavens
Hear
patiently
my
purpose
Ill
disrobe
me
Of
these
Italian
weeds
and
suit
myself
As
does
a
Britain
peasant
So
Ill
fight
Against
the
part
I
come
with
so
Ill
die
For
thee
Imogen
even
for
whom
my
life
Is
every
breath
a
death
And
thus
unknown
Pitied
nor
hated
to
the
face
of
peril
Myself
Ill
dedicate
Let
me
make
men
know
More
valour
in
me
than
my
habits
show
Gods
put
the
strength
o
th
Leonati
in
me
To
shame
the
guise
o
th
world
I
will
begin
The
fashion
less
without
and
more
within
Camst
thou
from
where
they
made
the
stand
I
did
Though
you
it
seems
come
from
the
fliers
I
did
No
blame
be
to
you
sir
for
all
was
lost
But
that
the
heavens
fought
The
King
himself
Of
his
wings
destitute
the
army
broken
And
but
the
backs
of
Britons
seen
an
flying
Through
a
strait
lane
the
enemy
fullhearted
Lolling
the
tongue
with
slaughtring
having
work
More
plentiful
than
tools
to
dot
struck
down
Some
mortally
some
slightly
touchd
some
falling
Merely
through
fear
that
the
strait
pass
was
dammd
With
dead
men
hurt
behind
and
cowards
living
To
die
with
lengthned
shame
Where
was
this
lane
Close
by
the
battle
ditchd
and
walld
with
turf
Which
gave
advantage
to
an
ancient
soldier
An
honest
one
I
warrant
who
deservd
So
long
a
breeding
as
his
white
beard
came
to
In
doing
this
fors
country
Athwart
the
lane
He
with
two
striplings
lads
more
like
to
run
The
country
base
than
to
commit
such
slaughter
With
faces
fit
for
masks
or
rather
fairer
Than
those
for
preservation
casd
or
shame
Made
good
the
passage
cried
to
those
that
fled
Our
Britains
harts
die
flying
not
our
men
To
darkness
fleet
souls
that
fly
backwards
Stand
Or
we
are
Romans
and
will
give
you
that
Like
beasts
which
you
shun
beastly
and
may
save
But
to
look
back
in
frown
Stand
stand
These
three
Three
thousand
confident
in
act
as
many
For
three
performers
are
the
file
when
all
The
rest
do
nothing
with
this
word
Stand
stand
Accommodated
by
the
place
more
charming
With
their
own
nobleness
which
could
have
turnd
distaff
to
a
lance
gilded
pale
looks
Part
shame
part
spirit
renewd
that
some
turnd
coward
But
by
example
a
sin
in
war
Damnd
in
the
first
beginners
gan
to
look
The
way
that
they
did
and
to
grin
like
lions
Upon
the
pikes
o
th
hunters
Then
began
stop
i
th
chaser
a
retire
anon
rout
confusion
thick
Forthwith
they
fly
Chickens
the
way
which
they
stoopd
eagles
slaves
The
strides
they
victors
made
and
now
our
cowards
Like
fragments
in
hard
voyages
became
The
life
o
th
need
Having
found
the
backdoor
open
Of
the
unguarded
hearts
heavens
how
they
wound
Some
slain
before
some
dying
some
their
friends
Oerborne
i
th
former

Ten
chasd
by

Are
now
each

the
slaughterman
of
twenty
Those
that
would
die
or
ere
resist
are
grown
The
mortal
bugs
o
th
field
This
was
strange
chance
narrow
lane
an
old
man
and
two
boys
Nay
do
not
wonder
at
it
you
are
made
Rather
to
wonder
at
the
things
you
hear
Than
to
work
any
Will
you
rhyme
upont
And
vent
it
for
a
mockry
Here
is
one
Two
boys
an
old
man
twice
a

Preservd

bane
Nay
be

sir
Lack

Who

not

his
foe
Ill
be
his

For
if
hell

he
is
made
to
do
I
know

quickly
fly
my
friendship
too
You
have
put
me
into
rhyme
Farewell
youre
angry
Still
going
This
is
a
lord
noble
misery
To
be
i
th
field
and
ask
What
news
of
me
Today
how
many
would
have
given
their
honours
To
have
savd
their
carcasses
took
heel
to
dot
And
yet
died
too
I
in
mine
own
woe
charmd
Could
not
find
death
where
I
did
hear
him
groan
Nor
feel
him
where
he
struck
Being
an
ugly
monster
Tis
strange
he
hides
him
in
fresh
cups
soft
beds
Sweet
words
or
hath
moe
ministers
than
we
That
draw
his
knives
i
th
war
Well
I
will
find
him
For
being
now
a
favourer
to
the
Briton
No
more
a
Briton
I
have
resumd
again
The
part
I
came
in
Fight
I
will
no
more
But
yield
me
to
the
veriest
hind
that
shall
Once
touch
my
shoulder
Great
the
slaughter
is
Here
made
by
th
Roman
great
the
answer
be
Britons
must
take
For
me
my
ransoms
death
On
either
side
I
come
to
spend
my
breath
Which
neither
here
Ill
keep
nor
bear
again
But
end
it
by
some
means
for
Imogen
Enter
two
and
soldiers
Great
Jupiter
be
praisd
Lucius
is
taken
Tis
thought
the
old
man
and
his
sons
were
angels
There
was
a
fourth
man
in
a
silly
habit
That
gave
th
affront
with
them
So
tis
reported
But
none
of
em
can
be
found
Stand
whos
there
Roman
Who
had
not
now
been
drooping
here
if
seconds
Had
answerd
him
Lay
hands
on
him
a
dog
leg
of
Rome
shall
not
return
to
tell
What
crows
have
peckd
them
here
He
brags
his
service
As
if
he
were
of
note
Bring
him
to
th
King
Enter
and
Roman
captives
The
present
to
who
delivers
him
over
to
a
gaoler
and
attendants
Stand
by
my
side
you
whom
the
gods
have
made
Preservers
of
my
throne
Woe
is
my
heart
That
the
poor
soldier
that
so
richly
fought
Whose
rags
shamd
gilded
arms
whose
naked
breast
Steppd
before
targes
of
proof
cannot
be
found
He
shall
be
happy
that
can
find
him
if
Our
grace
can
make
him
so
I
never
saw
Such
noble
fury
in
so
poor
a
thing
Such
precious
deeds
in
one
that
promisd
nought
But
beggary
and
poor
looks
No
tidings
of
him
He
hath
been
searchd
among
the
dead
and
living
But
no
trace
of
him
To
my
grief
I
am
The
heir
of
his
reward
To
and
which
I
will
add
To
you
the
liver
heart
and
brain
of
Britain
By
whom
I
grant
she
lives
Tis
now
the
time
To
ask
of
whence
you
are
Report
it
Sir
In
Cambria
are
we
born
and
gentlemen
Further
to
boast
were
neither
true
nor
modest
Unless
I
add
we
are
honest
Bow

knees
Arise
my
knights

you
Companions

our
person
and

fit
you
With

becoming
your
estates
Enter

Theres

these
faces
Why
so
sadly
Greet
you
our
victory
You
look
like
Romans
And
not
o
th
court
of
Britain
Hail
great
King
To
sour
your
happiness
I
must
report
The
Queen
is
dead
Who
worse
than
a
physician
Would
this
report
become
But
I
consider
By
medcinelife
may
be
prolongd
yet
death
Will
seize
the
doctor
too
How
ended
she
With
horror
madly
dying
like
her
life
Which
being
cruel
to
the
world
concluded
Most
cruel
to
herself
What
she
confessd
I
will
report
so
please
you
these
her
women
Can
trip
me
if
I
err
who
with
wet
cheeks
Were
present
when
she
finishd
Prithee
say
First
she
confessd
she
never
lovd
you
only
Affected
greatness
got
by
you
not
you
Married
your
royalty
was
wife
to
your
place
Abhorrd
your
person
She
alone
knew
this
And
but
she
spoke
it
dying
I
would
not
Believe
her
lips
in
opening
it
Proceed
Your
daughter
whom
she
bore
in
hand
to
love
With
such
integrity
she
did
confess
Was
as
a
scorpion
to
her
sight
whose
life
But
that
her
flight
prevented
it
she
had
Taen
off
by
poison
most
delicate
fiend
Who
ist
can
read
a
woman
Is
there
more
More
sir
and
worse
She
did
confess
she
had
For
you
a
mortal
mineral
which
being
took
Should
by
the
minute
feed
on
life
and
lingring
By
inches
waste
you
In
which
time
she
purposd
By
watching
weeping
tendance
kissing
to
Oercome
you
with
her
show
and
in
time
When
she
had
fitted
you
with
her
craft
to
work
Her
son
into
th
adoption
of
the
crown
But
failing
of
her
end
by
his
strange
absence
Grew
shamelessdesperate
opend
in
despite
Of
heaven
and
men
her
purposes
repented
The
evils
she
hatchd
were
not
effected
so
Despairing
died
Heard
you
all
this
her
women
We
did
so
please
your
Highness
Mine
eyes
Were
not
in
fault
for
she
was
beautiful
Mine
ears
that
heard
her
flattery
nor
my
heart
That
thought
her
like
her
seeming
It
had
been
vicious
To
have
mistrusted
her
yet
my
daughter
That
it
was
folly
in
me
thou
mayst
say
And
prove
it
in
thy
feeling
Heaven
mend
all
Enter
the
and
other
Roman
prisoners
guarded
behind
and
Thou
comst
not
Caius
now
for
tribute
that
The
Britons
have
razd
out
though
with
the
loss
Of
many
a
bold
one
whose
kinsmen
have
made
suit
That
their
good
souls
may
be
appeasd
with
slaughter
Of
you
their
captives
which
ourself
have
granted
So
think
of
your
estate
Consider
sir
the
chance
of
war
The
day
Was
yours
by
accident
had
it
gone
with
us
We
should
not
when
the
blood
was
cool
have
threatend
Our
prisoners
with
the
sword
But
since
the
gods
Will
have
it
thus
that
nothing
but
our
lives
May
be
calld
ransom
let
it
come
Sufficeth
Roman
with
a
Romans

am
glad
to
be
constraind
to
utter
that
Which
torments
me
to
conceal
By
villainy
I
got
this
ring
twas
Leonatus
jewel
Whom
thou
didst
banish
and
which
more
may
grieve
thee
As
it
doth
me
a
nobler
sir
neer
livd
Twixt
sky
and
ground
Wilt
thou
hear
more
my
lord
All
that
belongs
to
this
That
paragon
thy
daughter
For
whom
my
heart
drops
blood
and
my
false
spirits
Quail
to
remember
Give
me
leave
I
faint
My
daughter
What
of
her
Renew
thy
strength
I
had
rather
thou
shouldst
live
while
nature
will
Than
die
ere
I
hear
more
Strive
man
and
speak
Upon
a
time
unhappy
was
the
clock
That
struck
the
hour
was
in
Rome
accursd
The
mansion
where
twas
at
a
feast
would
Our
viands
had
been
poisond
or
at
least
Those
which
I
heavd
to
head
the
good
Posthumus
What
should
I
say
he
was
too
good
to
be
Where
ill
men
were
and
was
the
best
of
all
Amongst
the
rarst
of
good
ones
sitting
sadly
Hearing
us
praise
our
loves
of
Italy
For
beauty
that
made
barren
the
swelld
boast
Of
him
that
best
could
speak
for
feature
laming
The
shrine
of
Venus
or
straightpight
Minerva
Postures
beyond
brief
nature
for
condition
shop
of
all
the
qualities
that
man
Loves
woman
for
besides
that
hook
of
wiving
Fairness
which
strikes
the
eye
I
stand
on
fire
Come
to
the
matter
All
too
soon
I
shall
Unless
thou
wouldst
grieve
quickly
This
Posthumus
Most
like
a
noble
lord
in
love
and
one
That
had
a
royal
lover
took
his
hint
And
not
dispraising
whom
we
praisd
therein
He
was
as
calm
as
virtue
he
began
His
mistress
picture
which
by
his
tongue
being
made
And
then
a
mind
put
int
either
our
brags
Were
crackd
of
kitchen
trulls
or
his
description
Provd
us
unspeaking
sots
Nay
nay
to
th
purpose
Your
daughters
chastity
there
it
begins
He
spake
of
her
as
Dian
had
hot
dreams
And
she
alone
were
cold
whereat
I
wretch
Made
scruple
of
his
praise
and
wagerd
with
him
Pieces
of
gold
gainst
this
which
then
he
wore
Upon
his
honourd
finger
to
attain
In
suit
the
place
ofs
bed
and
win
this
ring
By
hers
and
mine
adultery
He
true
knight
No
lesser
of
her
honour
confident
Than
I
did
truly
find
her
stakes
this
ring
And
would
so
had
it
been
a
carbuncle
Of
Phoebus
wheel
and
might
so
safely
had
it
Been
all
the
worth
ofs
car
Away
to
Britain
Post
I
in
this
design
Well
may
you
sir
Remember
me
at
court
where
I
was
taught
Of
your
chaste
daughter
the
wide
difference
Twixt
amorous
and
villainous
Being
thus
quenchd
Of
hope
not
longing
mine
Italian
brain
Gan
in
your
duller
Britain
operate
Most
vilely
for
my
vantage
excellent
And
to
be
brief
my
practice
so
prevaild
That
I
returnd
with
simular
proof
enough
To
make
the
noble
Leonatus
mad
By
wounding
his
belief
in
her
renown
With
tokens
thus
and
thus
averring
notes
Of
chamberhanging
pictures
this
her
bracelet
cunning
how
I
got
it
nay
some
marks
Of
secret
on
her
person
that
he
could
not
But
think
her
bond
of
chastity
quite
crackd
I
having
taen
the
forfeit
Whereupon
Methinks
I
see
him
now
Coming
forward
Ay

Italian

Ay

credulous
fool
Egregious
murderer

To

Cornelius
The
Queen

very
oft
importund
me
To
temper
poisons
for
her
still
pretending
The
satisfaction
of
her
knowledge
only
In
killing
creatures
vile
as
cats
and
dogs
Of
no
esteem
I
dreading
that
her
purpose
Was
of
more
danger
did
compound
for
her
certain
stuff
which
being
taen
would
cease
The
present
powr
of
life
but
in
short
time
All
offices
of
nature
should
again
Do
their
due
functions
Have
you
taen
of
it
Most
like
I
did
for
I
was
dead
My
boys
There
was
our
error
This
is
sure
Fidele
Why
did
you
throw
your
wedded
lady
from
you
Think
that
you
are
upon
a
rock
and
now
Throw
me
again
Embracing
him
Hang
there
like
fruit
my
soul
Till
the
tree
die
How
now
my
flesh
my
child
What
makst
thou
me
a
dullard
in
this
act
Wilt
thou
not
speak
to
me
Kneeling
Your
blessing
sir
To
and
Though
you
did
love
this
youth
I
blame
ye
not
You
had
a
motive
fort
My
tears
that
fall
Prove
holy
water
on
thee
Imogen
Thy
mothers
dead
I
am
sorry
fort
my
lord
she
was
naught
and
long
of
her
it
was
That
we
meet
here
so
strangely
but
her
son
Is
gone
we
know
not
how
nor
where
My
lord
Now
fear
is
from
me
Ill
speak
troth
Lord
Cloten
Upon
my
ladys
missing
came
to
me
With
his
sword
drawn
foamd
at
the
mouth
and
swore
If
I
discoverd
not
which
way
she
was
gone
It
was
my
instant
death
By
accident
I
had
a
feigned
letter
of
my
masters
Then
in
my
pocket
which
directed
him
To
seek
her
on
the
mountains
near
to
Milford
Where
in
a
frenzy
in
my
masters
garments
Which
he
enforcd
from
me
away
he
posts
With
unchaste
purpose
and
with
oath
to
violate
My
ladys
honour
What
became
of
him
I
further
know
not
Let
me
end
the
story
I
slew
him
there
Marry
the
gods
forfend
I
would
not
thy
good
deeds
should
from
my
lips
Pluck
a
hard
sentence
Prithee
valiant
youth
Denyt
again
I
have
spoke
it
and
I
did
it
He
was
a
prince
most
incivil
one
The
wrongs
he
did
me
Were
nothing
princelike
for
he
did
provoke
me
With
language
that
would
make
me
spurn
the
sea
If
it
could
so
roar
to
me
I
cut
offs
head
And
am
right
glad
he
is
not
standing
here
To
tell
this
tale
of
mine
I
am
sorry
for
thee
By
thine
own
tongue
thou
art
condemnd
and
must
Endure
our
law
Thourt
dead
That
headless
man
I
thought
had
been
my
lord
Bind
the
offender
And
take
him
from
our
presence
Stay
sir
King
This
man
is
better
than
the
man
he
slew
As
well
descended
as
thyself
and
hath
More
of
thee
merited
than
a
band
of
Clotens
Had
ever
scar
for
To
the
guard
Let
his
arms
alone
They
were
not
born
for
bondage
Why
old
soldier
Wilt
thou
undo
the
worth
thou
art
unpaid
for
By
tasting
of
our
wrath
How
of
descent
As
good
as
we
In
that
he
spake
too
far
And
thou
shalt
die
fort
We
will
die
all
three
But
I
will
prove
that
two
ons
are
as
good
As
I
have
given
out
him
My
sons
I
must
For
mine
own
part
unfold
a
dangerous
speech
Though
haply
well
for
you
Your
dangers
ours
And
our
good
his
Have
at
it
then
by
leave
Thou
hadst
great
King
a
subject
who
Was
calld
Belarius
What
of
him
He
is
banishd
traitor
He
it
is
that
hath
Assumd
this
age
indeed
a
banishd
man
I
know
not
how
a
traitor
Take
him
hence
The
whole
world
shall
not
save
him
Not
too
hot
First
pay
me
for
the
nursing
of
thy
sons
And
let
it
be
confiscate
all
so
soon
As
I
have
receivd
it
Nursing
of
my
sons
I
am
too
blunt
and
saucy
heres
my
knee
Ere
I
arise
I
will
prefer
my
sons
Then
spare
not
the
old
father
Mighty
sir
These
two
young
gentlemen
that
call
me
father
And
think
they
are
my
sons
are
none
of
mine
They
are
the
issue
of
your
loins
my
liege
And
blood
of
your
begetting
How
my
issue
So
sure
as
you
your
fathers
I
old
Morgan
Am
that
Belarius
whom
you
sometime
banishd
Your
pleasure
was
my
mere
offence
my
punishment
Itself
and
all
my
treason
that
I
sufferd
Was
all
the
harm
I
did
These
gentle
princes
For
such
and
so
they
are
these
twenty
years
Have
I
traind
up
those
arts
they
have
as
Could
put
into
them
My
breeding
was
sir
as
Your
Highness
knows
Their
nurse
Euriphile
Whom
for
the
theft
I
wedded
stole
these
children
Upon
my
banishment
I
movd
her
tot
Having
receivd
the
punishment
before
For
that
which
I
did
then
Beaten
for
loyalty
Excited
me
to
treason
Their
dear
loss
The
more
of
you
twas
felt
the
more
it
shapd
Unto
my
end
of
stealing
them
But
gracious
sir
Here
are
your
sons
again
and
I
must
lose
Two
of
the
sweetst
companions
in
the
world
The
benediction
of
these
covering
heavens
Fall
on
their
heads
like
dew
for
they
are
worthy
To
inlay
heaven
with
stars
Thou
weepst
and
speakst
The
service
that
you
three
have
done
is
more
Unlike
than
this
thou
tellst
I
lost
my
children
If
these
be
they
I
know
not
how
to
wish
pair
of
worthier
sons
Be
pleasd
awhile
This
gentleman
whom
I
call
Polydore
Most
worthy
prince
as
yours
is
true
Guiderius
This
gentleman
my
Cadwal
Arviragus
Your
younger
princely
son
he
sir
was
lappd
In
a
most
curious
mantle
wrought
by
th
hand
Of
his
queen
mother
which
for
more
probation
I
can
with
ease
produce
Guiderius
had
Upon
his
neck
a
mole
a
sanguine
star
It
was
a
mark
of
wonder
This
is
he
Who
hath
upon
him
still
that
natural
stamp
It
was
wise
natures
end
in
the
donation
To
be
his
evidence
now
what
am
I
mother
to
the
birth
of
three
Neer
mother
Rejoicd
deliverance
more
Blest
pray
you
be
That
after
this
strange
starting
from
your
orbs
You
may
reign
in
them
now
Imogen
Thou
hast
lost
by
this
a
kingdom
No
my
lord
I
have
got
two
worlds
byt
my
gentle
brothers
Have
we
thus
met
never
say
hereafter
But
I
am
truest
speaker
You
calld
me
brother
When
I
was
but
your
sister
I
you
brothers
When
we
were
so
indeed
Did
you
eer
meet
Ay
my
good
lord
And
at
first
meeting
lovd
Continud
so
until
we
thought
he
died
By
the
Queens
dram
she
swallowd
rare
instinct
When
shall
I
hear
all
through
This
fierce
abridgment
Hath
to
it
circumstantial
branches
which
Distinction
should
be
rich
in
Where
how
livd
you
And
when
came
you
to
serve
our
Roman
captive
How
parted
with
your
brothers
how
first
met
them
Why
fled
you
from
the
court
and
whither
These
And
your
three
motives
to
the
battle
with
I
know
not
how
much
more
should
be
demanded
And
all
the
other
bydependences
From
chance
to
chance
but
nor
the
time
nor
place
Will
serve
our
long
interrogatories
See
Posthumus
anchors
upon
Imogen
And
she
like
harmless
lightning
throws
her
eye
On
him
her
brothers
me
her
master
hitting
Each
object
with
a
joy
the
counterchange
Is
severally
in
all
Lets
quit
this
ground
And
smoke
the
temple
with
our
sacrifices
To
Thou
art
my
brother
so
well
hold
thee
ever
You
are
my
father
too
and
did
relieve
me
To
see
this
gracious
season
All
oerjoyd
Save
these
in
bonds
Let
them
be
joyful
too
For
they
shall
taste
our
comfort
My
good
master
I
will
yet
do
you
service
Happy
be
you
The
forlorn
soldier
that
so
nobly
fought
He
would
have
well
becomd
this
place
and
gracd
The
thankings
of
a
king
I
am
sir
The
soldier
that
did
company
these
three
In
poor
beseeming
twas
a
fitment
for
The
purpose
I
then
followd
That
I
was
he
Speak
Iachimo
I
had
you
down
and
might
Have
made
you
finish
Kneeling
I
am
down
again
But
now
my
heavy
conscience
sinks
my
knee
As
then
your
force
did
Take
that
life
beseech
you
Which
I
so
often
owe
but
your
ring
first
And
here
the
bracelet
of
the
truest
princess
That
ever
swore
her
faith
Kneel
not
to
me
The
powr
that
I
have
on
you
is
to
spare
you
The
malice
towards
you
to
forgive
you
Live
And
deal
with
others
better
Nobly
doomd
Well
learn
our
freeness
of

Pardons
the
word
to

You

As
you
did
mean
indeed
to
be
our

Joyd
are
we
that
you
are
Your
servant
Princes
Good
my
lord
of
Rome
Call
forth
your
soothsayer
As
I
slept
methought
Great
Jupiter
upon
his
eagle
backd
Appeard
to
me
with
other
spritely
shows
Of
mine
own
kindred
When
I
wakd
I
found
This
label
on
my
bosom
whose
containing
Is
so
from
sense
in
hardness
that
I
can
Make
no
collection
of
it
Let
him
show
His
skill
in
the
construction
Philarmonus
Here
my
good
lord
Read
and
declare
the
meaning
Reads
When
as
a
lions
whelp
shall
to
himself
unknown
without
seeking
find
and
be
embracd
by
a
piece
of
tender
air
and
when
from

stately
cedar
shall
be
loppd

which
being
dead
many
years
shall
after
revive
be
jointed

shall
Posthumus
end
his
miseries
Britain
be
fortunate
and
flourish
in
peace
and
plenty
Thou
Leonatus
art
the
lions

The
fit

apt
construction
of
thy

Being
Leonatus
doth
import
so
much
To
The
piece
of
tender
air
thy
virtuous
daughter
Which
we
call
mollis

and

We
term

mulier
which
mulier
I
divine
Is
this
most
constant
wife
who
even
now
Answering
the
letter
of
the
oracle
Unknown
to
you
unsought
were
clippd
about
With

This

seeming
The

Cymbeline
Personates

and

branches
point
Thy
two

forth
who
by
Belarius
stoln
For
many
years
thought
dead
are
now
revivd
To
the
majestic

Promises
Britain
peace
and

Well
My
peace
we
will
begin
And
Caius
Lucius
Although
the
victor
we
submit
to
Caesar
And
to
the
Roman
empire
promising
To
pay
our
wonted
tribute
from
the
which
We
were
dissuaded
by
our
wicked
queen
Whom
heavens
in
justice
both
on
her
and
hers
Have
laid
most
heavy
hand
The
fingers
of

Of

From

I

but
our
fantasy
And
will
not
let
belief
take
hold
of
him
Touching
this
dreaded
sight
twice
seen
of
us
Therefore
I
have
entreated
him
along
With
us
to
watch
the
minutes
of
this
night
That
if
again
this
apparition
come
He
may
approve
our

Sit

fortified

What
we
two
nights
have
seen
Hor
Well
sit
we
down
And
let
us
hear
Bernardo
speak
of
this
Ber
Last
night
of
all
When
yond
same
star
thats
westward
from
the
pole
Had
made
his
course
t
illume

part

In

figure

Thou

Looks

not
like

King

Most
like
It
harrows
me
with
fear
and
wonder
Ber
It
would
be
spoke
to
Mar
Question
it
Horatio
Hor
What
art
thou
that
usurpst
this
time
of
night
Together
with
that
fair
and
warlike
form
In
which
the
majesty
of
buried
Denmark
Did
sometimes
march
By
heaven
I
charge
thee

Mar
It

offended

See
it

Stay

Mar
Tis
gone

Ber
How
now
Horatio
You
tremble
and
look
pale
Is
not
this
something
more
than
fantasy
What
think
you
ont
Hor
Before
my
God
I
might
not
this
believe
Without
the
sensible
and
true
avouch
Of
mine
own
eyes
Mar
Is
it
not
like
the
King
Hor
As
thou
art
to
thyself
Such
was
the
very
armour
he
had
on
When
he
th
ambitious
Norway
combated
So
frownd
he
once
when
in
an
angry
parle
He
smote
the
sledded
Polacks
on
the
ice
Tis
strange
Mar
Thus
twice
before
and
jump
at
this
dead
hour
With
martial
stalk
hath
he
gone
by
our
watch
Hor
In
what
particular
thought
to
work
I
know
not
But
in
the
gross
and
scope
of
my
opinion
This
bodes
some
strange
eruption
to
our
state
Mar
Good
now
sit
down
and
tell
me
he
that
knows
Why
this
same
strict
and
most
observant
watch
So
nightly
toils
the
subject
of
the
land
And
why
such
daily
cast
of
brazen
cannon
And
foreign
mart
for
implements
of
war
Why
such
impress
of
shipwrights
whose
sore
task
Does
not
divide
the
Sunday
from
the
week
What
might
be
toward
that
this
sweaty
haste
Doth
make
the
night
jointlabourer
with
the
day
Who
ist
that
can
inform
me
Hor
That
can
I
At
least
the
whisper
goes
so
Our
last
king
Whose
image
even
but
now
appeard
to
us
Was
as
you
know
by
Fortinbras
of
Norway
Thereto
prickd
on
by
a
most
emulate
pride
Dard
to
the
combat
in
which
our
valiant
Hamlet
For
so
this
side
of
our
known
world
esteemd
him
Did
slay
this
Fortinbras
who
by
a
seald
compact
Well
ratified
by
law
and
heraldry
Did
forfeit
with
his
life
all
those
his
lands
Which
he
stood
seizd
of
to
the
conqueror
Against
the
which
a
moiety
competent
Was
gaged
by
our
king
which
had
returnd
To
the
inheritance
of
Fortinbras
Had
he
been
vanquisher
as
by
the
same
comart
And
carriage
of
the
article
designd
His
fell
to
Hamlet
Now
sir
young
Fortinbras
Of
unimproved
mettle
hot
and
full
Hath
in
the
skirts
of
Norway
here
and
there
Sharkd
up
a
list
of
lawless
resolutes
For
food
and
diet
to
some
enterprise
That
hath
a
stomach
int
which
is
no
other
As
it
doth
well
appear
unto
our
state
But
to
recover
of
us
by
strong
hand
And
terms
compulsatory
those
foresaid
lands
So
by
his
father
lost
and
this
I
take
it
Is
the
main
motive
of
our
preparations
The
source
of
this
our
watch
and
the
chief
head
Of
this
posthaste
and
romage
in
the
land
Ber
I
think
it
be
no
other
but
een
so
Well
may
it
sort
that
this
portentous
figure
Comes
armed
through
our
watch
so
like
the
King
That
was
and
is
the
question
of
these
wars
Hor
mote
it
is
to
trouble
the
minds
eye
In
the
most
high
and
palmy
state
of
Rome
little
ere
the
mightiest
Julius
fell
The
graves
stood
tenantless
and
the
sheeted
dead
Did
squeak
and
gibber
in
the
Roman
streets
As
stars
with
trains
of
fire
and
dews
of
blood
Disasters
in
the
sun
and
the
moist
star
Upon
whose
influence
Neptunes
empire
stands
Was
sick
almost
to
doomsday
with
eclipse
And
even
the
like
precurse
of
fierce
events
As
harbingers
preceding
still
the
fates
And
prologue
to
the
omen
coming
on
Have
heaven
and
earth
together
demonstrated
Unto
our
climature
and
countrymen
Enter
Ghost
again
But
soft
behold
Lo
where
it
comes
again
Ill
cross
it
though
it
blast
me
Stay
illusion
Spreads
his
arms
If
thou
hast
any
sound
or
use
of
voice
Speak
to
me
If
there
be
any
good
thing
to
be
done
That
may
to
thee
do
ease
and
race
to
me
Speak
to
me
If
thou
art
privy
to
thy
countrys
fate
Which
happily
foreknowing
may
avoid
speak
Or
if
thou
hast
uphoarded
in
thy
life
Extorted
treasure
in
the
womb
of
earth
For
which
they
say
you
spirits
oft
walk
in
death
The
cock
crows
Speak
of
it
Stay
and
speak
Stop
it
Marcellus
Mar
Shall
I
strike
at
it
with
my
partisan
Hor
Do
if
it
will
not
stand
Ber
Tis
here
Hor
Tis
here
Mar
Tis
gone
We
do
it
wrong
being
so
majestical
To
offer
it
the
show
of
violence
For
it
is
as
the
air
invulnerable
And
our
vain
blows
malicious
mockery
Ber
It
was
about
to
speak
when
the
cock
crew
Hor
And
then
it
started
like
a
guilty
thing
Upon
a
fearful
summons
I
have
heard
The
cock
that
is
the
trumpet
to
the
morn
Doth
with
his
lofty
and
shrillsounding
throat
Awake
the
god
of
day
and
at
his
warning
Whether
in
sea
or
fire
in
earth
or
air
Th
extravagant
and
erring
spirit
hies
To
his
confine
and
of
the
truth
herein
This
present
object
made
probation
Mar
It
faded
on
the
crowing
of
the
cock
Some
say
that
ever
gainst
that
season
comes
Wherein
our
Saviours
birth
is
celebrated
The
bird
of
dawning
singeth
all
night
long
And
then
they
say
no
spirit
dare
stir
abroad
The
nights
are
wholesome
then
no
planets
strike
No
fairy
takes
nor
witch
hath
power
to
charm
So
hallowd
and
so
gracious
is
the
time
Hor
So
have
I
heard
and
do
in
part
believe
it
But
look
the
morn
in
russet
mantle
clad
Walks
oer
the
dew
of
yon
high
eastward
hill
Break
we
our
watch
up
and
by
my
advice
Let
us
impart
what
we
have
seen
tonight
Unto
young
Hamlet
for
upon
my
life
This
spirit
dumb
to
us
will
speak
to
him
Do
you
consent
we
shall
acquaint
him
with
it
As
needful
in
our
loves
fitting
our
duty
Lets
dot
I
pray
and
I
this
morning
know
Where
we
shall
find
him
most
conveniently
Scene
Elsinore
room
of

Castle
Flourish
Enter
Claudius
King
of
Denmark
Gertrude
the
Queen
Hamlet
Polonius
Laertes
and
his
sister
Ophelia
Voltemand
Cornelius
Lords
Attendant
King
Though
yet
of
Hamlet
our
dear
brothers
death
The
memory
be
green
and
that
it
us
befitted
To
bear
our
hearts
in
grief
and
our
whole
kingdom
To
be
contracted
in
one
brow
of
woe
Yet
so
far
hath
discretion
fought
with
nature
That
we
with
wisest
sorrow
think
on
him
Together
with
remembrance
of
ourselves
Therefore
our
sometime
sister
now
our
queen
Th
imperial
jointress
to
this
warlike
state
Have
we
as
twere
with
a
defeated
joy
With
an
auspicious
and
a
dropping
eye
With
mirth
in
funeral
and
with
dirge
in
marriage
In
equal
scale
weighing
delight
and
dole
Taken
to
wife
nor
have
we
herein
barrd
Your
better
wisdoms
which
have
freely
gone
With
this
affair
along
For
all
our
thanks
Now
follows
that
you
know
young
Fortinbras
Holding
a
weak
supposal
of
our
worth
Or
thinking
by
our
late
dear
brothers
death
Our
state
to
be
disjoint
and
out
of
frame
Colleagued
with
this
dream
of
his
advantage
He
hath
not
faild
to
pester
us
with
message
Importing
the
surrender
of
those
lands
Lost
by
his
father
with
all
bands
of
law
To
our
most
valiant
brother
So
much
for
him
Now
for
ourself
and
for
this
time
of
meeting
Thus
much
the
business
is
we
have
here
writ
To
Norway
uncle
of
young
Fortinbras
Who
impotent
and
bedrid
scarcely
hears
Of
this
his
nephews
purpose
to
suppress
His
further
gait
herein
in
that
the
levies
The
lists
and
full
proportions
are
all
made
Out
of
his
subject
and
we
here
dispatch
You
good
Cornelius
and
you
Voltemand
For
bearers
of
this
greeting
to
old
Norway
Giving
to
you
no
further
personal
power
To
business
with
the
King
more
than
the
scope
Of
these
dilated
articles
allow
Gives
a
paper
Farewell
and
let
your
haste
commend
your
duty
Cor
Volt
In
that
and
all
things
will
we
show
our
duty
King
We
doubt
it
nothing
Heartily
farewell
And
now
Laertes
whats
the
news
with
you
You
told
us
of
some
suit
What
ist
Laertes
You
cannot
speak
of
reason
to
the
Dane
And
lose
your
voice
What
wouldst
thou
beg
Laertes
That
shall
not
be
my
offer
not
thy
asking
The
head
is
not
more
native
to
the
heart
The
hand
more
instrumental
to
the
mouth
Than
is
the
throne
of
Denmark
to
thy
father
What
wouldst
thou
have
Laertes
Laer
My
dread
lord
Your
leave
and
favour
to
return
to
France
From
whence
though
willingly
I
came
to
Denmark
To
show
my
duty
in
your
coronation
Yet
now
I
must
confess
that
duty
done
My
thoughts
and
wishes
bend
again
toward
France
And
bow
them
to
your
gracious
leave
and
pardon
King
Have
you
your
fathers
leave
What
says
Polonius
Pol
He
hath
my
lord
wrung
from
me
my
slow
leave
By
laboursome
petition
and
at
last
Upon
his
will
I
seald
my
hard
consent
I
do
beseech
you
give
him
leave
to
go
King
Take
thy
fair
hour
Laertes
Time
be
thine
And
thy
best
graces
spend
it
at
thy
will
But
now
my
cousin
Hamlet
and
my
son
Ham
aside
little
more
than
kin
and
less
than
kind
King
How
is
it
that
the
clouds
still
hang
on
you
Ham
Not
so
my
lord
I
am
too
much
i
th
sun
Queen
Good
Hamlet
cast
thy
nighted
colour
off
And
let
thine
eye
look
like
a
friend
on
Denmark
Do
not
for
ever
with
thy
vailed
lids
Seek
for
thy
noble
father
in
the
dust
Thou
knowst
tis
common
All
that
lives
must
die
Passing
through
nature
to
eternity
Ham
Ay
madam
it
is
common
Queen
If
it
be
Why
seems
it
so
particular
with
thee
Ham
Seems
madam
Nay
it
is
I
know
not
seems
Tis
not
alone
my
inky
cloak
good
mother
Nor
customary
suits
of
solemn
black
Nor
windy
suspiration
of
forcd
breath
No
nor
the
fruitful
river
in
the
eye
Nor
the
dejected
havior
of
the
visage
Together
with
all
forms
moods
shapes
of
grief
That
can
denote
me
truly
These
indeed
seem
For
they
are
actions
that
a
man
might
play
But
I
have
that
within
which
passeth
show
These
but
the
trappings
and
the
suits
of
woe
King
Tis
sweet
and
commendable
in
your
nature
Hamlet
To
give
these
mourning
duties
to
your
father
But
you
must
know
your
father
lost
a
father
That
father
lost
lost
his
and
the
survivor
bound
In
filial
obligation
for
some
term
To
do
obsequious
sorrow
But
to
persever
In
obstinate
condolement
is
a
course
Of
impious
stubbornness
Tis
unmanly
grief
It
shows
a
will
most
incorrect
to
heaven
heart
unfortified
a
mind
impatient
An
understanding
simple
and
unschoold
For
what
we
know
must
be
and
is
as
common
As
any
the
most
vulgar
thing
to
sense
Why
should
we
in
our
peevish
opposition
Take
it
to
heart
Fie
tis
a
fault
to
heaven
fault
against
the
dead
a
fault
to
nature
To
reason
most
absurd
whose
common
theme
Is
death
of
fathers
and
who
still
hath
cried
From
the
first
corse
till
he
that
died
today
This
must
be
so
We
pray
you
throw
to
earth
This
unprevailing
woe
and
think
of
us
As
of
a
father
for
let
the
world
take
note
You
are
the
most
immediate
to
our
throne
And
with
no
less
nobility
of
love
Than
that
which
dearest
father
bears
his
son
Do
I
impart
toward
you
For
your
intent
In
going
back
to
school
in
Wittenberg
It
is
most
retrograde
to
our
desire
And
we
beseech
you
bend
you
to
remain
Here
in
the
cheer
and
comfort
of
our
eye
Our
chiefest
courtier
cousin
and
our
son
Queen
Let
not
thy
mother
lose
her
prayers
Hamlet
I
pray
thee
stay
with
us
go
not
to
Wittenberg
Ham
I
shall
in
all
my
best
obey
you
madam
King
Why
tis
a
loving
and
a
fair
reply
Be
as
ourself
in
Denmark
Madam
come
This
gentle
and
unforcd
accord
of
Hamlet
Sits
smiling
to
my
heart
in
grace
whereof
No
jocund
health
that
Denmark
drinks
today
But
the
great
cannon
to
the
clouds
shall
tell
And
the
Kings
rouse
the
heaven
shall
bruit
again
Respeaking
earthly
thunder
Come
away
Flourish
Ham
that
this
too
too
solid
flesh
would
melt
Thaw
and
resolve
itself
into
a
dew
Or
that
the
Everlasting
had
not
fixd
His
canon
gainst
selfslaughter
God
God
How
weary
stale
flat
and
unprofitable
Seem
to
me

Fie

ah
fie
Tis
an
unweeded
garden
That
grows
to
seed
things
rank
and
gross
in
nature
Possess
it
merely
That
it
should
come
to
this
But
two
months
dead
Nay
not
so
much
not
two
So
excellent
a
king
that
was
to
this
Hyperion
to
a
satyr
so
loving
to
my
mother
That
he
might
not
beteem
the
winds
of
heaven
Visit
her
face
too
roughly
Heaven
and
earth
Must
I
remember
Why
she
would
hang
on
him
As
if
increase
of
appetite
had
grown
By
what
it
fed
on
and
yet
within
a
month
Let
me
not
think
ont
Frailty
thy
name
is
woman
little
month
or
ere
those
shoes
were
old
With
which
she
followed
my
poor
fathers
body
Like
Niobe
all
tears
why
she
even
she
God
a
beast
that
wants
discourse
of
reason
Would
have
mournd
longer
married
with
my
uncle
My
fathers
brother
but
no
more
like
my
father
Than
I
to
Hercules
Within
a
month
Ere
yet
the
salt
of
most
unrighteous
tears
Had
left
the
flushing
in
her
galled
eyes
She
married
most
wicked
speed
to
post
With
such
dexterity
to
incestuous
sheets
It
is
not
nor
it
cannot
come
to
good
But
break
my
heart
for
I
must
hold
my
tongue
Enter
Horatio
Marcellus
and
Bernardo
Hor
Hail
to
your
lordship
Ham
I
am
glad
to
see
you
well
Horatio
or
I
do
forget
myself
Hor
The
same
my
lord
and
your
poor
servant
ever
Ham
Sir
my
good
friend
Ill
change
that
name
with
you
And
what
make
you
from
Wittenberg
Horatio
Marcellus
Mar
My
good
lord
Ham
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
To
Bernardo
Good
even
sir
But
what
in
faith
make
you
from
Wittenberg
Hor
truant
disposition
good
my
lord
Ham
I
would
not
hear
your
enemy
say
so
Nor
shall
you
do
my
ear
that
violence
To
make
it
truster
of
your
own
report
Against
yourself
I
know
you
are
no
truant
But
what
is
your
affair
in
Elsinore
Well
teach
you
to
drink
deep
ere
you
depart
Hor
My
lord
I
came
to
see
your
fathers
funeral
Ham
I
prithee
do
not
mock
me
fellow
student
I
think
it
was
to
see
my
mothers
wedding
Hor
Indeed
my
lord
it
followed
hard
upon
Ham
Thrift
thrift
Horatio
The
funeral
bakd
meats
Did
coldly
furnish
forth
the
marriage
tables
Would
I
had
met
my
dearest
foe
in
heaven
Or
ever
I
had
seen
that
day
Horatio
My
father
methinks
I
see
my
father
Hor
where
my
lord
Ham
In
my
minds
eye
Horatio
Hor
I
saw
him
once
He
was
a
goodly
king
Ham
He
was
a
man
take
him
for
all
in
all
I
shall
not
look
upon
his
like
again
Hor
My
lord
I
think
I
saw
him
yesternight
Ham
Saw
who
Hor
My
lord
the
King
your
father
Ham
The
King
my
father
Hor
Season
your
admiration
for
a
while
With
an
attent
ear
till
I
may
deliver
Upon
the
witness
of
these
gentlemen
This
marvel
to
you
Ham
For
Gods
love
let
me
hear
Hor
Two
nights
together
had
these
gentlemen
Marcellus
and
Bernardo
on
their
watch
In
the
dead
vast
and
middle
of
the
night
Been
thus
encountred
figure
like
your
father
Armed
at
point
exactly
capape
Appears
before
them
and
with
solemn
march
Goes
slow
and
stately
by
them
Thrice
he
walkd
By
their
oppressd
and
fearsurprised
eyes
Within
his
truncheons
length
whilst
they
distilld
Almost
to
jelly
with
the
act
of
fear
Stand
dumb
and
speak
not
to
him
This
to
me
In
dreadful
secrecy
impart
they
did
And
I
with
them
the
third
night
kept
the
watch
Where
as
they
had
deliverd
both
in
time
Form
of
the
thing
each
word
made
true
and
good
The
apparition
comes
I
knew
your
father
These
hands
are
not
more
like
Ham
But
where
was
this
Mar
My
lord
upon
the
platform
where
we
watchd
Ham
Did
you
not
speak
to
it
Hor
My
lord
I
did
But
answer
made
it
none
Yet
once
methought
It
lifted
up
it
head
and
did
address
Itself
to
motion
like
as
it
would
speak
But
even
then
the
morning
cock
crew
loud
And
at
the
sound
it
shrunk
in
haste
away
And
vanishd
from
our
sight
Ham
Tis
very
strange
Hor
As
I
do
live
my
honourd
lord
tis
true
And
we
did
think
it
writ
down
in
our
duty
To
let
you
know
of
it
Ham
Indeed
indeed
sirs
But
this
troubles
me
Hold
you
the
watch
tonight
Both
Mar
and
Ber
We
do
my
lord
Ham
Armd
say
you
Both
Armd
my
lord
Ham
From
top
to
toe
Both
My
lord
from
head
to
foot
Ham
Then
saw
you
not
his
face
Hor
yes
my
lord
He
wore
his
beaver
up
Ham
What
lookd
he
frowningly
Hor
countenance
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
Ham
Pale
or
red
Hor
Nay
very
pale
Ham
And
fixd
his
eyes
upon
you
Hor
Most
constantly
Ham
I
would
I
had
been
there
Hor
It
would
have
much
amazd
you
Ham
Very
like
very
like
Stayd
it
long
Hor
While
one
with
moderate
haste
might
tell
a
hundred
Both
Longer
longer
Hor
Not
when
I
sawt
Ham
His
beard
was
grizzled
no
Hor
It
was
as
I
have
seen
it
in
his
life
sable
silverd
Ham
I
will
watch
tonight
Perchance
twill
walk
again
Hor
I
warrnt
it
will
Ham
If
it
assume
my
noble
fathers
person
Ill
speak
to
it
though
hell
itself
should
gape
And
bid
me
hold
my
peace
I
pray
you
all
If
you
have
hitherto
conceald
this
sight
Let
it
be
tenable
in
your
silence
still
And
whatsoever
else
shall
hap
tonight
Give
it
an
understanding
but
no
tongue
I
will
requite
your
loves
So
fare
you
well
Upon
the
platform
twixt
eleven
and
twelve
Ill
visit
you
All
Our
duty
to
your
honour
Ham
Your
loves
as
mine
to
you
Farewell
My
fathers
spirit
in
arms
All
is
not
well
I
doubt
some
foul
play
Would
the
night
were
come
Till
then
sit
still
my
soul
Foul
deeds
will
rise
Though
all
the
earth
oerwhelm
them
to
mens
eyes
Scene
Elsinore
room
in
the
house
of
Polonius
Enter
Laertes
and
Ophelia
Laer
My
necessaries
are
embarkd
Farewell
And
sister
as
the
winds
give
benefit
And
convoy
is
assistant
do
not
sleep
But
let
me
hear
from
you
Oph
Do
you
doubt
that
Laer
For
Hamlet
and
the
trifling
of
his
favour
Hold
it
a
fashion
and
a
toy
in
blood
violet
in
the
youth
of
primy
nature
Forward
not
permanent
sweet
not
lasting
The
perfume
and
suppliance
of
a
minute
No
more
Oph
No
more
but
so
Laer
Think
it
no
more
For
nature
crescent
does
not
grow
alone
In
thews
and
bulk
but
as
this
temple
waxes
The
inward
service
of
the
mind
and
soul
Grows
wide
withal
Perhaps
he
loves
you
now
And
now
no
soil
nor
cautel
doth
besmirch
The
virtue
of
his
will
but
you
must
fear
His
greatness
weighd
his
will
is
not
his
own
For
he
himself
is
subject
to
his
birth
He
may
not
as
unvalued
persons
do
Carve
for
himself
for
on
his
choice
depends
The
safety
and
health
of
this
whole
state
And
therefore
must
his
choice
be
circumscribd
Unto
the
voice
and
yielding
of
that
body
Whereof
he
is
the
head
Then
if
he
says
he
loves
you
It
fits
your
wisdom
so
far
to
believe
it
As
he
in
his
particular
act
and
place
May
give
his
saying
deed
which
is
no
further
Than
the
main
voice
of
Denmark
goes
withal
Then
weigh
what
loss
your
honour
may
sustain
If
with
too
credent
ear
you
list
his
songs
Or
lose
your
heart
or
your
chaste
treasure
open
To
his
unmastred
importunity
Fear
it
Ophelia
fear
it
my
dear
sister
And
keep
you
in
the
rear
of
your
affection
Out
of
the
shot
and
danger
of
desire
The
chariest
maid
is
prodigal
enough
If
she
unmask
her
beauty
to
the
moon
Virtue
itself
scopes
not
calumnious
strokes
The
canker
galls
the
infants
of
the
spring
Too
oft
before
their
buttons
be
disclosd
And
in
the
morn
and
liquid
dew
of
youth
Contagious
blastments
are
most
imminent
Be
wary
then
best
safety
lies
in
fear
Youth
to
itself
rebels
though
none
else
near
Oph
I
shall
th
effect
of
this
good
lesson
keep
As
watchman
to
my
heart
But
good
my
brother
Do
not
as
some
ungracious
pastors
do
Show
me
the
steep
and
thorny
way
to
heaven
Whiles
like
a
puffd
and
reckless
libertine
Himself
the
primrose
path
of
dalliance
treads
And
recks
not
his
own
rede
Laer
fear
me
not
Enter
Polonius
I
stay
too
long
But
here
my
father
comes
double
blessing
is
a
double
grace
Occasion
smiles
upon
a
second
leave
Pol
Yet
here
Laertes
Aboard
aboard
for
shame
The
wind
sits
in
the
shoulder
of
your
sail
And
you
are
stayd
for
There
my
blessing
with
thee
And
these
few
precepts
in
thy
memory
Look
thou
character
Give
thy
thoughts
no
tongue
Nor
any
unproportiond
thought
his
act
Be
thou
familiar
but
by
no
means
vulgar
Those
friends
thou
hast
and
their
adoption
tried
Grapple
them
unto
thy
soul
with
hoops
of
steel
But
do
not
dull
thy
palm
with
entertainment
Of
each
newhatchd
unfledgd
comrade
Beware
Of
entrance
to
a
quarrel
but
being
in
Beart
that
th
opposed
may
beware
of
thee
Give
every
man
thine
ear
but
few
thy
voice
Take
each
mans
censure
but
reserve
thy
judgment
Costly
thy
habit
as
thy
purse
can
buy
But
not
expressd
in
fancy
rich
not
gaudy
For
the
apparel
oft
proclaims
the
man
And
they
in
France
of
the
best
rank
and
station
Are
most
select
and
generous
chief
in
that
Neither
a
borrower
nor
a
lender
be
For
loan
oft
loses
both
itself
and
friend
And
borrowing
dulls
the
edge
of
husbandry
This
above
all
to
thine
own
self
be
true
And
it
must
follow
as
the
night
the
day
Thou
canst
not
then
be
false
to
any
man
Farewell
My
blessing
season
this
in
thee
Laer
Most
humbly
do
I
take
my
leave
my
lord
Pol
The
time
invites
you
Go
your
servants
tend
Laer
Farewell
Ophelia
and
remember
well
What
I
have
said
to
you
Oph
Tis
in
my
memory
lockd
And
you
yourself
shall
keep
the
key
of
it
Laer
Farewell
Pol
What
ist
Ophelia
he
hath
said
to
you
Oph
So
please
you
something
touching
the
Lord
Hamlet
Pol
Marry
well
bethought
Tis
told
me
he
hath
very
oft
of
late
Given
private
time
to
you
and
you
yourself
Have
of
your
audience
been
most
free
and
bounteous
If
it
be
so
as
so
tis
put
on
me
And
that
in
way
of
caution
I
must
tell
you
You
do
not
understand
yourself
so
clearly
As
it
behooves
my
daughter
and
your
honour
What
is
between
you
Give
me
up
the
truth
Oph
He
hath
my
lord
of
late
made
many
tenders
Of
his
affection
to
me
Pol
Affection
Pooh
You
speak
like
a
green
girl
Unsifted
in
such
perilous
circumstance
Do
you
believe
his
tenders
as
you
call
them
Oph
I
do
not
know
my
lord
what
I
should
think
Pol
Marry
I
will
teach
you
Think
yourself
a
baby
That
you
have
taen
these
tenders
for
true
pay
Which
are
not
sterling
Tender
yourself
more
dearly
Or
not
to
crack
the
wind
of
the
poor
phrase
Running
it
thus
youll
tender
me
a
fool
Oph
My
lord
he
hath
importund
me
with
love
In
honourable
fashion
Pol
Ay
fashion
you
may
call
it
Go
to
go
to
Oph
And
hath
given
countenance
to
his
speech
my
lord
With
almost
all
the
holy
vows
of
heaven
Pol
Ay
springes
to
catch
woodcocks
I
do
know
When
the
blood
burns
how
prodigal
the
soul
Lends
the
tongue
vows
These
blazes
daughter
Giving
more
light
than
heat
extinct
in
both
Even
in
their
promise
as
it
is
amaking
You
must
not
take
for
fire
From
this
time
Be
something
scanter
of
your
maiden
presence
Set
your
entreatments
at
a
higher
rate
Than
a
command
to
parley
For
Lord
Hamlet
Believe
so
much
in
him
that
he
is
young
And
with
a
larger
tether
may
he
walk
Than
may
be
given
you
In
few
Ophelia
Do
not
believe
his
vows
for
they
are
brokers
Not
of
that
dye
which
their
investments
show
But
mere
implorators
of
unholy
suits
Breathing
like
sanctified
and
pious
bawds
The
better
to
beguile
This
is
for
all
I
would
not
in
plain
terms
from
this
time
forth
Have
you
so
slander
any
moment
leisure
As
to
give
words
or
talk
with
the
Lord
Hamlet
Look
tot
I
charge
you
Come
your
ways
Oph
I
shall
obey
my
lord
Scene
Elsinore
The
platform
before
the
Castle
Enter
Hamlet
Horatio
and
Marcellus
Ham
The
air
bites
shrewdly
it
is
very
cold
Hor
It
is
a
nipping
and
an
eager
air
Ham
What
hour
now
Hor
I
think
it
lacks
of
twelve
Mar
No
it
is
struck
Hor
Indeed
I
heard
it
not
It
then
draws
near
the
season
Wherein
the
spirit
held
his
wont
to
walk
flourish
of
trumpets
and
two
pieces
go
off
What
does
this
mean
my
lord
Ham
The
King
doth
wake
tonight
and
takes
his
rouse
Keeps
wassail
and
the
swaggring
upspring
reels
And
as
he
drains
his
draughts
of
Rhenish
down
The
kettledrum
and
trumpet
thus
bray
out
The
triumph
of
his
pledge
Hor
Is
it
a
custom
Ham
Ay
marry
ist
But
to
my
mind
though
I
am
native
here
And
to
the
manner
born
it
is
a
custom
More
honourd
in
the
breach
than
the
observance
This
heavyheaded
revel
east
and
west
Makes
us
traducd
and
taxd
of
other
nations
They
clip
us
drunkards
and
with
swinish
phrase
Soil
our
addition
and
indeed
it
takes
From
our
achievements
though
performd
at
height
The
pith
and
marrow
of
our
attribute
So
oft
it
chances
in
particular
men
That
for
some
vicious
mole
of
nature
in
them
As
in
their
birth
wherein
they
are
not
guilty
Since
nature
cannot
choose
his
origin
By
the
oergrowth
of
some
complexion
Oft
breaking
down
the
pales
and
forts
of
reason
Or
by
some
habit
that
too
much
oerleavens
The
form
of
plausive
manners
that
these
men
Carrying
I
say
the
stamp
of
one
defect
Being
natures
livery
or
fortunes
star
Their
virtues
else
be
they
as
pure
as
grace
As
infinite
as
man
may
undergo
Shall
in
the
general
censure
take
corruption
From
that
particular
fault
The
dram
of
eil
Doth
all
the
noble
substance
often
dout
To
his
own
scandal
Enter

Look
my

Bring

a

Let
me
not
burst
in

but
tell
Why
thy
canonizd

hearsed
in
death
Have
burst
their
cerements
why
the
sepulchre
Wherein
we
saw
thee
quietly
inurnd
Hath
opd
his
ponderous
and
marble
jaws
To
cast
thee
up
again
What
may
this
mean
That
thou
dead
corse
again
in
complete
steel
Revisits
thus
the
glimpses
of
the
moon
Making
night
hideous
and
we
fools
of
nature
So
horridly
to
shake
our
disposition
With
thoughts
beyond
the
reaches
of
our
souls
Say
why
is
this
wherefore
What
should
we
do
Ghost

It
beckons
you
to
go

As

did
desire
To
you

Look

But

not
speak
Then
will
I
follow
it
Hor
Do
not
my
lord
Ham
Why
what
should
be
the
fear
I
do
not
set
my
life
at
a
pins
fee
And
for
my
soul
what
can
it
do
to
that
Being
a
thing
immortal
as
itself
It
waves
me
forth
again
Ill
follow
it
Hor
What
if
it
tempt
you
toward
the
flood
my
lord
Or
to
the
dreadful
summit
of
the
cliff
That
beetles
oer
his
base
into
the
sea
And
there
assume
some
other
horrible
form
Which
might
deprive
your
sovereignty
of
reason
And
draw
you
into
madness
Think
of
it
The
very
place
puts
toys
of
desperation
Without
more
motive
into
every
brain
That
looks
so
many
fadoms
to
the
sea
And
hears
it
roar
beneath
Ham
It
waves
me
still
Go
on
Ill
follow
thee
Mar
You
shall
not
go
my
lord
Ham
Hold
off
your
hands
Hor
Be
ruld
You
shall
not
go
Ham
My
fate
cries
out
And
makes
each
petty
artire
in
this
body
As
hardy
as
the
Nemean
lions
nerve
Ghost
beckons
Still
am
I
calld
Unhand
me
gentlemen
By
heaven
Ill
make
a
ghost
of
him
that
lets
me
I
say
away
Go
on
Ill
follow
thee
Hor
He
waxes
desperate
with
imagination
Mar
Lets
follow
Tis
not
fit
thus
to
obey
him
Hor
Have
after
To
what
issue
wail
this
come
Mar
Something
is
rotten
in
the
state
of
Denmark
Hor
Heaven
will
direct
it
Mar
Nay
lets
follow
him
Scene
Elsinore
The
Castle
Another
part
of
the
fortifications
Enter
Ghost
and
Hamlet
Ham
Whither
wilt
thou
lead
me
Speak
Ill
go
no
further
Ghost
Mark
me
Ham
I
will
Ghost
My
hour
is
almost
come
When
I
to
sulphrous
and
tormenting
flames
Must
render
up
myself
Ham
Alas
poor
ghost
Ghost
Pity
me
not
but
lend
thy
serious
hearing
To
what
I
shall
unfold
Ham
Speak
I
am
bound
to
hear
Ghost
So
art
thou
to
revenge
when
thou
shalt
hear
Ham
What
Ghost
I
am
thy
fathers
spirit
Doomd
for
a
certain
term
to
walk
the
night
And
for
the
day
confind
to
fast
in
fires
Till
the
foul
crimes
done
in
my
days
of
nature
Are
burnt
and
purgd
away
But
that
I
am
forbid
To
tell
the
secrets
of
my
prison
house
I
could
a
tale
unfold
whose
lightest
word
Would
harrow
up
thy
soul
freeze
thy
young
blood
Make
thy
two
eyes
like
stars
start
from
their
spheres
Thy
knotted
and
combined
locks
to
part
And
each
particular
hair
to
stand
an
end
Like
quills
upon
the
fretful
porpentine
But
this
eternal
blazon
must
not
be
To
ears
of
flesh
and
blood
List
list
list
If
thou
didst
ever
thy
dear
father
love
Ham
God
Ghost
Revenge
his
foul
and
most
unnatural
murther
Ham
Murther
Ghost
Murther
most
foul
as
in
the
best
it
is
But
this
most
foul
strange
and
unnatural
Ham
Haste
me
to
knowt
that
I
with
wings
as
swift
As
meditation
or
the
thoughts
of
love
May
sweep
to
my
revenge
Ghost
I
find
thee
apt
And
duller
shouldst
thou
be
than
the
fat
weed
That
rots
itself
in
ease
on
Lethe
wharf
Wouldst
thou
not
stir
in
this
Now
Hamlet
hear
Tis
given
out
that
sleeping
in
my
orchard
serpent
stung
me
So
the
whole
ear
of
Denmark
Is
by
a
forged
process
of
my
death
Rankly
abusd
But
know
thou
noble
youth
The
serpent
that
did
sting
thy
fathers
life
Now
wears
his
crown
Ham
my
prophetic
soul
My
uncle
Ghost
Ay
that
incestuous
that
adulterate
beast
With
witchcraft
of
his
wit
with
traitorous
gifts
wicked
wit
and
gifts
that
have
the
power
So
to
seduce
won
to
his
shameful
lust
The
will
of
my
most
seemingvirtuous
queen
Hamlet
what
a
fallingoff
was
there
From
me
whose
love
was
of
that
dignity
That
it
went
hand
in
hand
even
with
the
vow
I
made
to
her
in
marriage
and
to
decline
Upon
a
wretch
whose
natural
gifts
were
poor
To
those
of
mine
But
virtue
as
it
never
will
be
movd
Though
lewdness
court
it
in
a
shape
of
heaven
So
lust
though
to
a
radiant
angel
linkd
Will
sate
itself
in
a
celestial
bed
And
prey
on
garbage
But
soft
methinks
I
scent
the
morning
air
Brief
let
me
be
Sleeping
within
my
orchard
My
custom
always
of
the
afternoon
Upon
my
secure
hour
thy
uncle
stole
With
juice
of
cursed
hebona
in
a
vial
And
in
the
porches
of
my
ears
did
pour
The
leperous
distilment
whose
effect
Holds
such
an
enmity
with
blood
of
man
That
swift
as
quicksilverr
it
courses
through
The
natural
gates
and
alleys
of
the
body
And
with
a
sudden
vigour
it
doth
posset
And
curd
like
eager
droppings
into
milk
The
thin
and
wholesome
blood
So
did
it
mine
And
a
most
instant
tetter
barkd
about
Most
lazarlike
with
vile
and
loathsome
crust
All
my
smooth
body
Thus
was
I
sleeping
by
a
brothers
hand
Of
life
of
crown
of
queen
at
once
dispatchd
Cut
off
even
in
the
blossoms
of
my
sin
Unhousled
disappointed
unaneld
No
reckoning
made
but
sent
to
my
account
With
all
my
imperfections
on
my
head
Ham
horrible
horrible
most
horrible
Ghost
If
thou
hast
nature
in
thee
bear
it
not
Let
not
the
royal
bed
of
Denmark
be
couch
for
luxury
and
damned
incest
But
howsoever
thou
pursuest
this
act
Taint
not
thy
mind
nor
let
thy
soul
contrive
Against
thy
mother
aught
Leave
her
to
heaven
And
to
those
thorns
that
in
her
bosom
lodge
To
prick
and
sting
her
Fare
thee
well
at
once
The
glowworm
shows
the
matin
to
be
near
And
gins
to
pale
his
uneffectual
fire
Adieu
adieu
adieu
Remember
me
Ham
all
you
host
of
heaven
earth
What
else
And
shall
I
couple
hell
Hold
hold
my
heart
And
you
my
sinews
grow
not
instant
old
But
bear
me
stiffly
up
Remember
thee
Ay
thou
poor
ghost
while
memory
holds
a
seat
In
this
distracted
globe
Remember
thee
Yea
from
the
table
of
my
memory
Ill
wipe
away
all
trivial
fond
records
All
saws
of
books
all
forms
all
pressures
past
That
youth
and
observation
copied
there
And
thy
commandment
all
alone
shall
live
Within
the
book
and
volume
of
my
brain
Unmixd
with
baser
matter
Yes
by

most
pernicious
woman

damned
villain
My

Meet

down
That

a
villain
At
least
I
am
sure
it
may
be
so
in
Denmark
Writes

To

Ham
Why

You

And

You

For

For

th
earth
so
fast
worthy
pioner
Once

remove
good
friends
Hor
day
and
night
but
this
is
wondrous
strange
Ham
And
therefore
as
a
stranger
give
it
welcome
There
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
Horatio
Than
are
dreamt
of
in
your
philosophy
But
come
Here
as
before
never
so
help
you
mercy
How
strange
or
odd
soeer
I
bear
myself
As
I
perchance
hereafter
shall
think
meet
To
put
an
antic
disposition
on
That
you
at
such
times
seeing
me
never
shall
With
arms
encumbred
thus
or
this
headshake
Or
by
pronouncing
of
some
doubtful
phrase
As
Well
well
we
know
or
We
could
an
if
we
would
Or
If
we
list
to
speak
or
There
be
an
if
they
might
Or
such
ambiguous
giving
out
to
note
That
you
know
aught
of
me
this
is
not
to
do
So
grace
and
mercy
at
your
most
need
help
you
Swear
Ghost
beneath
Swear
They
swear
Ham
Rest
rest
perturbed
spirit
So
gentlemen
With
all
my
love
I
do
commend
me
to
you
And
what
so
poor
a
man
as
Hamlet
is
May
do
t
express
his
love
and
friending
to
you
God
willing
shall
not
lack
Let
us
go
in
together
And
still
your
fingers
on
your
lips
I
pray
The
time
is
out
of
joint
cursed
spite
That
ever
I
was
born
to
set
it
right
Nay
come
lets
go
together
Act
Scene
I
Elsinore
room
in
the
house
of
Polonius
Enter
Polonius
and
Reynaldo
Pol
Give
him
this
money
and
these
notes
Reynaldo
Rey
I
will
my
lord
Pol
You
shall
do
marvells
wisely
good
Reynaldo
Before
You
visit
him
to
make
inquire
Of
his
behaviour
Rey
My
lord
I
did
intend
it
Pol
Marry
well
said
very
well
said
Look
you
sir
Enquire
me
first
what
Danskers
are
in
Paris
And
how
and
who
what
means
and
where
they
keep
What
company
at
what
expense
and
finding
By
this
encompassment
and
drift
of
question
That
they
do
know
my
son
come
you
more
nearer
Than
your
particular
demands
will
touch
it
Take
you
as
twere
some
distant
knowledge
of
him
As
thus
I
know
his
father
and
his
friends
And
in
part
him
Do
you
mark
this
Reynaldo
Rey
Ay
very
well
my
lord
Pol
And
in
part
him
but
you
may
say
not
well
But
ift
be
he
I
mean
hes
very
wild
Addicted
so
and
so
and
there
put
on
him
What
forgeries
you
please
marry
none
so
rank
As
may
dishonour
him
take
heed
of
that
But
sir
such
wanton
wild
and
usual
slips
As
are
companions
noted
and
most
known
To
youth
and
liberty
Rey
As
gaming
my
lord
Pol
Ay
or
drinking
fencing
swearing
quarrelling
Drabbing
You
may
go
so
far
Rey
My
lord
that
would
dishonour
him
Pol
Faith
no
as
you
may
season
it
in
the
charge
You
must
not
put
another
scandal
on
him
That
he
is
open
to
incontinency
Thats
not
my
meaning
But
breathe
his
faults
so
quaintly
That
they
may
seem
the
taints
of
liberty
The
flash
and
outbreak
of
a
fiery
mind
savageness
in
unreclaimed
blood
Of
general
assault
Rey
But
my
good
lord
Pol
Wherefore
should
you
do
this
Rey
Ay
my
lord
I
would
know
that
Pol
Marry
sir
heres
my
drift
And
I
believe
it
is
a
fetch
of
warrant
You
laying
these
slight
sullies
on
my
son
As
twere
a
thing
a
little
soild
i
th
working
Mark
you
Your
party
in
converse
him
you
would
sound
Having
ever
seen
in
the
prenominate
crimes
The
youth
you
breathe
of
guilty
be
assurd
He
closes
with
you
in
this
consequence
Good
sir
or
so
or
friend
or
gentleman
According
to
the
phrase
or
the
addition
Of
man
and
country
Rey
Very
good
my
lord
Pol
And
then
sir
does
a
this
a
does
What
was
I
about
to
say
By
the
mass
I
was
about
to
say
something
Where
did
I
leave
Rey
At
closes
in
the
consequence
at
friend
or
so
and
gentleman
Pol
At
closes
in
the
consequence
Ay
marry
He
closes
thus
I
know
the
gentleman
I
saw
him
yesterday
or
tother
day
Or
then
or
then
with
such
or
such
and
as
you
say
There
was
a
gaming
there
oertook
ins
rouse
There
falling
out
at
tennis
or
perchance
I
saw
him
enter
such
a
house
of
sale
Videlicet
a
brothel
or
so
forth
See
you
now
Your
bait
of
falsehood
takes
this
carp
of
truth
And
thus
do
we
of
wisdom
and
of
reach
With
windlasses
and
with
assays
of
bias
By
indirections
find
directions
out
So
by
my
former
lecture
and
advice
Shall
you
my
son
You
have
me
have
you
not
Rey
My
lord
I
have
Pol
God
b
wi
ye
fare
ye
well
Rey
Good
my
lord
Going
Pol
Observe
his
inclination
in
yourself
Rey
I
shall
my
lord
Pol
And
let
him
ply
his
music
Rey
Well
my
lord
Pol
Farewell
Enter
Ophelia
How
now
Ophelia
Whats
the
matter
Oph
my
lord
my
lord
I
have
been
so
affrighted
Pol
With
what
i
th
name
of
God
I
Oph
My
lord
as
I
was
sewing
in
my
closet
Lord
Hamlet
with
his
doublet
all
unbracd
No
hat
upon
his
head
his
stockings
fould
Ungartred
and
downgyved
to
his
ankle
Pale
as
his
shirt
his
knees
knocking
each
other
And
with
a
look
so
piteous
in
purport
As
if
he
had
been
loosed
out
of
hell
To
speak
of
horrors
he
comes
before
me
Pol
Mad
for
thy
love
Oph
My
lord
I
do
not
know
But
truly
I
do
fear
it
Pol
What
said
he
Oph
He
took
me
by
the
wrist
and
held
me
hard
Then
goes
he
to
the
length
of
all
his
arm
And
with
his
other
hand
thus
oer
his
brow
He
falls
to
such
perusal
of
my
face
As
he
would
draw
it
Long
stayd
he
so
At
last
a
little
shaking
of
mine
arm
And
thrice
his
head
thus
waving
up
and
down
He
raisd
a
sigh
so
piteous
and
profound
As
it
did
seem
to
shatter
all
his
bulk
And
end
his
being
That
done
he
lets
me
go
And
with
his
head
over
his
shoulder
turnd
He
seemd
to
find
his
way
without
his
eyes
For
out
o
doors
he
went
without
their
help
And
to
the
last
bended
their
light
on
me
Pol
Come
go
with
me
I
will
go
seek
the
King
This
is
the
very
ecstasy
of
love
Whose
violent
property
fordoes
itself
And
leads
the
will
to
desperate
undertakings
As
oft
as
any
passion
under
heaven
That
does
afflict
our
natures
I
am
sorry
What
have
you
given
him
any
hard
words
of
late
Oph
No
my
good
lord
but
as
you
did
command
I
did
repel
his
letters
and
denied
His
access
to
me
Pol
That
hath
made
him
mad
I
am
sorry
that
with
better
heed
and
judgment
I
had
not
quoted
him
I
feard
he
did
but
trifle
And
meant
to
wrack
thee
but
beshrew
my
jealousy
By
heaven
it
is
as
proper
to
our
age
To
cast
beyond
ourselves
in
our
opinions
As
it
is
common
for
the
younger
sort
To
lack
discretion
Come
go
we
to
the
King
This
must
be
known
which
being
kept
close
might
move
More
grief
to
hide
than
hate
to
utter
love
Come

Welcome
dear
Rosencrantz
and
Guildenstern
Moreover
that
we
much
did
long
to
see
you
The
need
we
have
to
use
you
did
provoke
Our
hasty
sending
Something
have
you
heard
Of
Hamlets
transformation
So
I
call
it
Sith
nor
th
exterior
nor
the
inward
man
Resembles
that
it
was
What
it
should
be
More
than
his
fathers
death
that
thus
hath
put
him
So
much
from
th
understanding
of
himself
I
cannot
dream
of
I
entreat
you
both
That
being
of
so
young
clays
brought
up
with
him
And
since
so
neighbourd
to
his
youth
and
haviour
That
you
vouchsafe
your
rest
here
in
our
court
Some
little
time
so
by
your
companies
To
draw
him
on
to
pleasures
and
to
gather
So
much
as
from
occasion
you
may
glean
Whether
aught
to
us
unknown
afflicts
him
thus
That
opend
lies
within
our
remedy
Queen
Good
gentlemen
he
hath
much
talkd
of
you
And
sure
I
am
two
men
there
are
not
living
To
whom
he
more
adheres
If
it
will
please
you
To
show
us
so
much
gentry
and
good
will
As
to
expend
your
time
with
us
awhile
For
the
supply
and
profit
of
our
hope
Your
visitation
shall
receive
such
thanks
As
fits
a
kings
remembrance
Ros
Both
your
Majesties
Might
by
the
sovereign
power
you
have
of
us
Put
your
dread
pleasures
more
into
command
Than
to
entreaty
Guil
But
we
both
obey
And
here
give
up
ourselves
in
the
full
bent
To
lay
our
service
freely
at
your
feet
To
be
commanded
King
Thanks
Rosencrantz

gentle
Guildenstern
Queen
Thanks
Guildenstern
and
gentle
Rosencrantz
And
I
beseech
you
instantly

My

changed

of
you
And
bring

Pleasant

the
father
of
good
news
Pol
Have
I
my
lord
Assure
you
my
good
liege
I
hold
my
duty
as
I
hold
my
soul
Both
to
my
God
and
to
my
gracious
king
And
I
do
think
or
else
this
brain
of
mine
Hunts
not
the
trail
of
policy
so
sure
As
it
hath
usd
to
do
that
I
have
found
The
very
cause
of
Hamlets
lunacy
King
speak
of
that
That
do
I
long
to
hear
Pol
Give
first
admittance
to
th
ambassadors
My
news
shall
be
the
fruit
to
that
great
feast
King
Thyself
do
grace
to
them
and
bring
them
in
He
tells
me
my
dear
Gertrude
he
hath
found
The
head
and
source
of
all
your
sons
distemper
Queen
I
doubt
it
is
no
other
but
the
main
His
fathers
death
and
our
oerhasty
marriage
King
Well
we
shall
sift
him
Enter
Polonius
Voltemand
and
Cornelius
Welcome
my
good
friends
Say
Voltemand
what
from
our
brother
Norway
Volt
Most
fair
return
of
greetings
and
desires
Upon
our
first
he
sent
out
to
suppress
His
nephews
levies
which
to
him
appeard
To
be
a
preparation
gainst
the
Polack
But
better
lookd
into
he
truly
found
It
was
against
your
Highness
whereat
grievd
That
so
his
sickness
age
and
impotence
Was
falsely
borne
in
hand
sends
out
arrests
On
Fortinbras
which
he
in
brief
obeys
Receives
rebuke
from
Norway
and
in
fine
Makes
vow
before
his
uncle
never
more
To
give
th
assay
of
arms
against
your
Majesty
Whereon
old
Norway
overcome
with
joy
Gives
him
three
thousand
crowns
in
annual
fee
And
his
commission
to
employ
those
soldiers
So
levied
as
before
against
the
Polack
With
an
entreaty
herein
further
shown
Gives
a
paper
That
it
might
please
you
to
give
quiet
pass
Through
your
dominions
for
this
enterprise
On
such
regards
of
safety
and
allowance
As
therein
are
set
down
King
It
likes
us
well
And
at
our
more
considerd
time
well
read
Answer
and
think
upon
this
business
Meantime
we
thank
you
for
your
welltook
labour
Go
to
your
rest
at
night
well
feast
together
Most
welcome
home
Pol
This
business
is
well
ended
My
liege
and
madam
to
expostulate
What
majesty
should
be
what
duty
is
Why
day
is
day
night
is
night
and
time
is
time
Were
nothing
but
to
waste
night
day
and
time
Therefore
since
brevity
is
the
soul
of
wit
And
tediousness
the
limbs
and
outward
flourishes
I
will
be
brief
Your
noble
son
is
mad
Mad
call
I
it
for
to
define
true
madness
What
ist
but
to
be
nothing
else
but
mad
But
let
that
go
Queen
More
matter
with
less
art
Pol
Madam
I
swear
I
use
no
art
at
all
That
he
is
mad
tis
true
tis
true
tis
pity
And
pity
tis
tis
true
foolish
figure
But
farewell
it
for
I
will
use
no
art
Mad
let
us
grant
him
then
And
now
remains
That
we
find
out
the
cause
of
this
effect
Or
rather
say
the
cause
of
this
defect
For
this
effect
defective
comes
by
cause
Thus
it
remains
and
the
remainder
thus
Perpend
I
have
a
daughter
have
while
she
is
mine
Who
in
her
duty
and
obedience
mark
Hath
given
me
this
Now
gather
and
surmise
Reads
the
letter
To
the
celestial
and
my
souls
idol
the
most
beautified
Ophelia
Thats
an
ill
phrase
a
vile
phrase
beautified
is
a
vile
phrase
But
you
shall
hear
Thus
Reads
In
her
excellent
white
bosom
these
c
Queen
Came
this
from
Hamlet
to
her
Pol
Good
madam
stay
awhile
I
will
be
faithful
Reads
Doubt
thou
the
stars
are
fire
Doubt
that
the
sun
doth
move
Doubt
truth
to
be
a
liar
But
never
doubt
I
love
dear
Ophelia
I
am
ill
at
these
numbers
I
have
not
art
to
reckon
my
groans
but
that
I
love
thee
best
most
best
believe
it
Adieu
Thine
evermore
most
dear
lady
whilst
this
machine
is
to
him
This
in
obedience
hath
my
daughter
shown
me
And
more
above
hath
his
solicitings
As
they
fell
out
by
time
by
means
and
place
All
given
to
mine
ear
King
But
how
hath
she
Receivd
his
love
Pol
What
do
you
think
of
me
King
As
of
a
man
faithful
and
honourable
Pol
I
would
fain
prove
so
But
what
might
you
think
When
I
had
seen
this
hot
love
on
the
wing
As
I
perceivd
it
I
must
tell
you
that
Before
my
daughter
told
me
what
might
you
Or
my
dear
Majesty
your
queen
here
think
If
I
had
playd
the
desk
or
table
book
Or
given
my
heart
a
winking
mute
and
dumb
Or
lookd
upon
this
love
with
idle
sight
What
might
you
think
No
I
went
round
to
work
And
my
young
mistress
thus
I
did
bespeak
Lord
Hamlet
is
a
prince
out
of
thy
star
This
must
not
be
And
then
I
prescripts
gave
her
That
she
should
lock
herself
from
his
resort
Admit
no
messengers
receive
no
tokens
Which
done
she
took
the
fruits
of
my
advice
And
he
repulsed
a
short
tale
to
make
Fell
into
a
sadness
then
into
a
fast
Thence
to
a
watch
thence
into
a
weakness
Thence
to
a
lightness
and
by
this
declension
Into
the
madness
wherein
now
he
raves
And
all
we
mourn
for
King
Do
you
think
tis
this
Queen
it
may
be
very
like
Pol
Hath
there
been
such
a
time
I
would
fain
know
that
That
I
have
Positively
said
Tis
so
When
it
provd
otherwise
King
Not
that
I
know
Pol
points
to
his
head
and
shoulder
Take
this
from
this
if
this
be
otherwise
If
circumstances
lead
me
I
will
find
Where
truth
is
hid
though
it
were
hid
indeed
Within
the
centre
King
How
may
we
try
it
further
Pol
You
know
sometimes
he
walks
four
hours
together
Here
in
the
lobby
Queen
So
he
does
indeed
Pol
At
such
a
time
Ill
loose
my
daughter
to
him
Be
you
and
I
behind
an
arras
then
Mark
the
encounter
If
he
love
her
not
And
he
not
from
his
reason
falln
thereon
Let
me
be
no
assistant
for
a
state
But
keep
a
farm
and
carters
King
We
will
try
it
Enter
Hamlet
reading
on
a
book
Queen
But
look
where
sadly
the
poor
wretch
comes
reading
Pol
Away
I
do
beseech
you
both
away
Ill
board
him
presently
give
me
leave
How
does
my
good
Lord
Hamlet
Ham
Well
Godamercy
Pol
Do
you
know
me
my
lord
Ham
Excellent
well
You
are
a
fishmonger
Pol
Not
I
my
lord
Ham
Then
I
would
you
were
so
honest
a
man
Pol
Honest
my
lord
Ham
Ay
sir
To
be
honest
as
this
world
goes
is
to
be
one
man
pickd
out
of
ten
thousand
Pol
Thats
very
true
my
lord
Ham
For
if
the
sun
breed
maggots
in
a
dead
dog
being
a
god
kissing
carrion
Have
you
a
daughter
Pol
I
have
my
lord
Ham
Let
her
not
walk
i
th
sun
Conception
is
a
blessing
but
not
as
your
daughter
may
conceive
Friend
look
tot
Pol
aside
How
say
you
by
that
Still
harping
on
my
daughter
Yet
he
knew
me
not
at
first
He
said
I
was
a
fishmonger
He
is
far
gone
far
gone
And
truly
in
my
youth
I
suffred
much
extremity
for
love
very
near
this
Ill
speak
to
him
again
What
do
you
read
my
lord
Ham
Words
words
words
Pol
What
is
the
matter
my
lord
Ham
Between
who
Pol
I
mean
the
matter
that
you
read
my
lord
Ham
Slanders
sir
for
the
satirical
rogue
says
here
that
old
men
have
grey
beards
that
their
faces
are
wrinkled
their
eyes
purging
thick
amber
and
plumtree
gum
and
that
they
have
a
plentiful
lack
of
wit
together
with
most
weak
hams
All
which
sir
though
I
most
powerfully
and
potently
believe
yet
I
hold
it
not
honesty
to
have
it
thus
set
down
for
you
yourself
sir
should
be
old
as
I
am
if
like
a
crab
you
could
go
backward
Pol
aside
Though
this
be
madness
yet
there
is
a
method
int
Will
You
walk
out
of
the
air
my
lord
Ham
Into
my
grave
Pol
Indeed
that
is
out
o
th
air
Aside
How
pregnant
sometimes
his
replies
are
a
happiness
that
often
madness
hits
on
which
reason
and
sanity
could
not
so
prosperously
be
delivered
of
I
will
leave
him
and
suddenly
contrive
the
means
of
meeting
between
him
and
my
daughter
My
honourable
lord
I
will
most
humbly
take
my
leave
of
you
Ham
You
cannot
sir
take
from
me
anything
that
I
will
more
willingly
part
withal
except
my
life
except
my
life
except
my
life
Enter
Rosencrantz
and
Guildenstern
Pol
Fare
you
well
my
lord
Ham
These
tedious
old
fools
Pol
You
go
to
seek
the
Lord
Hamlet
There
he
is
Ros
to
Polonius
God
save
you
sir
Guil
My
honourd
lord
Ros
My
most
dear
lord
Ham
My
excellent
good
friends
How
dost
thou
Guildenstern
Ah
Rosencrantz
Good
lads
how
do
ye
both
Ros
As
the
indifferent
children
of
the
earth
Guil
Happy
in
that
we
are
not
overhappy
On
Fortunes
cap
we
are
not
the
very
button
Ham
Nor
the
soles
of
her
shoe
Ros
Neither
my
lord
Ham
Then
you
live
about
her
waist
or
in
the
middle
of
her
favours
Guil
Faith
her
privates
we
Ham
In
the
secret
parts
of
Fortune
most
true
she
is
a
strumpet
What
news
Ros
None
my
lord
but
that
the
worlds
grown
honest
Ham
Then
is
doomsday
near
But
your
news
is
not
true
Let
me
question
more
in
particular
What
have
you
my
good
friends
deserved
at
the
hands
of
Fortune
that
she
sends
you
to
prison
hither
Guil
Prison
my
lord
Ham
Denmarks
a
prison
Ros
Then
is
the
world
one
Ham
goodly
one
in
which
there
are
many
confines
wards
and
dungeons
Denmark
being
one
o
th
worst
Ros
We
think
not
so
my
lord
Ham
Why
then
tis
none
to
you
for
there
is
nothing
either
good
or
bad
but
thinking
makes
it
so
To
me
it
is
a
prison
Ros
Why
then
your
ambition
makes
it
one
Tis
too
narrow
for
your
mind
Ham
God
I
could
be
bounded
in
a
nutshell
and
count
myself
a
king
of
infinite
space
were
it
not
that
I
have
bad
dreams
Guil
Which
dreams
indeed
are
ambition
for
the
very
substance
of
the
ambitious
is
merely
the
shadow
of
a
dream
Ham
dream
itself
is
but
a
shadow
Ros
Truly
and
I
hold
ambition
of
so
airy
and
light
a
quality
that
it
is
but
a
shadows
shadow
Ham
Then
are
our
beggars
bodies
and
our
monarchs
and
outstretchd
heroes
the
beggars
shadows
Shall
we
to
th
court
for
by
my
fay
I
cannot
reason
Both
Well
wait
upon
you
Ham
No
such
matter
I
will
not
sort
you
with
the
rest
of
my
servants
for
to
speak
to
you
like
an
honest
man
I
am
most
dreadfully
attended
But
in
the
beaten
way
of
friendship
what
make
you
at
Elsinore
Ros
To
visit
you
my
lord
no
other
occasion
Ham
Beggar
that
I
am
I
am
even
poor
in
thanks
but
I
thank
you
and
sure
dear
friends
my
thanks
are
too
dear
a
halfpenny
Were
you
not
sent
for
Is
it
your
own
inclining
Is
it
a
free
visitation
Come
deal
justly
with
me
Come
come
Nay
speak
Guil
What
should
we
say
my
lord
Ham
Why
anything
but
to
th
purpose
You
were
sent
for
and
there
is
a
kind
of
confession
in
your
looks
which
your
modesties
have
not
craft
enough
to
colour
I
know
the
good
King
and
Queen
have
sent
for
you
Ros
To
what
end
my
lord
Ham
That
you
must
teach
me
But
let
me
conjure
you
by
the
rights
of
our
fellowship
by
the
consonancy
of
our
youth
by
the
obligation
of
our
everpreserved
love
and
by
what
more
dear
a
better
proposer
could
charge
you
withal
be
even
and
direct
with
me
whether
you
were
sent
for
or
no
Ros
aside
to
Guildenstern
What
say
you
Ham
aside
Nay
then
I
have
an
eye
of
you
If
you
love
me
hold
not
off
Guil
My
lord
we
were
sent
for
Ham
I
will
tell
you
why
So
shall
my
anticipation
prevent
your
discovery
and
your
secrecy
to
the
King
and
Queen
moult
no
feather
I
have
of
late
but
wherefore
I
know
not
lost
all
my
mirth
forgone
all
custom
of
exercises
and
indeed
it
goes
so
heavily
with
my
disposition
that
this
goodly
frame
the
earth
seems
to
me
a
sterile
promontory
this
most
excellent
canopy
the
air
look
you
this
brave
oerhanging
firmament
this
majestical
roof
fretted
with
golden
fire
why
it
appeareth
no
other
thing
to
me
than
a
foul
and
pestilent
congregation
of
vapours
What
a
piece
of
work
is
a
man
how
noble
in
reason
how
infinite
in
faculties
in
form
and
moving
how
express
and
admirable
in
action
how
like
an
angel
in
apprehension
how
like
a
god
the
beauty
of
the
world
the
paragon
of
animals
And
yet
to
me
what
is
this
quintessence
of
dust
Man
delights
not
me
no
nor
woman
neither
though
by
your
smiling
you
seem
to
say
so
Ros
My
lord
there
was
no
such
stuff
in
my
thoughts
Ham
Why
did
you
laugh
then
when
I
said
Man
delights
not
me
Ros
To
think
my
lord
if
you
delight
not
in
man
what
lenten
entertainment
the
players
shall
receive
from
you
We
coted
them
on
the
way
and
hither
are
they
coming
to
offer
you
service
Ham
He
that
plays
the
king
shall
be
welcome
his
Majesty
shall
have
tribute
of
me
the
adventurous
knight
shall
use
his
foil
and
target
the
lover
shall
not
sigh
gratis
the
humorous
man
shall
end
his
part
in
peace
the
clown
shall
make
those
laugh
whose
lungs
are
tickle
o
th
sere
and
the
lady
shall
say
her
mind
freely
or
the
blank
verse
shall
halt
fort
What
players
are
they
Ros
Even
those
you
were
wont
to
take
such
delight
in
the
tragedians
of
the
city
Ham
How
chances
it
they
travel
Their
residence
both
in
reputation
and
profit
was
better
both
ways
Ros
I
think
their
inhibition
comes
by
the
means
of
the
late
innovation
Ham
Do
they
hold
the
same
estimation
they
did
when
I
was
in
the
city
Are
they
so
followd
Ros
No
indeed
are
they
not
Ham
How
comes
it
Do
they
grow
rusty
Ros
Nay
their
endeavour
keeps
in
the
wonted
pace
but
there
is
sir
an
eyrie
of
children
little
eyases
that
cry
out
on
the
top
of
question
and
are
most
tyrannically
clappd
fort
These
are
now
the
fashion
and
so
berattle
the
common
stages
so
they
call
them
that
many
wearing
rapiers
are
afraid
of
goosequills
and
dare
scarce
come
thither
Ham
What
are
they
children
Who
maintains
em
How
are
they
escoted
Will
they
pursue
the
quality
no
longer
than
they
can
sing
Will
they
not
say
afterwards
if
they
should
grow
themselves
to
common
players
as
it
is
most
like
if
their
means
are
no
better
their
writers
do
them
wrong
to
make
them
exclaim
against
their
own
succession
Ros
Faith
there
has
been
much
to
do
on
both
sides
and
the
nation
holds
it
no
sin
to
tarre
them
to
controversy
There
was
for
a
while
no
money
bid
for
argument
unless
the
poet
and
the
player
went
to
cuffs
in
the
question
Ham
Ist
possible
Guil
there
has
been
much
throwing
about
of
brains
Ham
Do
the
boys
carry
it
away
Ros
Ay
that
they
do
my
lord
Hercules
and
his
load
too
Ham
It
is
not
very
strange
for
my
uncle
is
King
of
Denmark
and
those
that
would
make
mows
at
him
while
my
father
lived
give
twenty
forty
fifty
a
hundred
ducats
apiece
for
his
picture
in
little
Sblood
there
is
something
in
this
more
than
natural
if
philosophy
could
find
it
out
Flourish

Players
Guil
There
are
the

Ham
Gentlemen
you

Your

Th
appurtenance
of
welcome
is

Let
me
comply

you
in
this
garb
lest
my
extent
to
the
players
which
I
tell
you
must
show
fairly
outwards

more
appear
like

yours
You

Well
have
a
speech
straight
Come
give
us
a
taste
of
your
quality
Come
a
passionate
speech
Play
What
speech
my
good
lord
Ham
I
heard
thee
speak
me
a
speech
once
but
it
was
never
acted
or
if
it
was
not
above
once
for
the
play
I
remember
pleasd
not
the
million
twas
caviary
to
the
general
but
it
was
as
I
receivd
it
and
others
whose
judgments
in
such
matters
cried
in
the
top
of
mine
an
excellent
play
well
digested
in
the
scenes
set
down
with
as
much
modesty
as
cunning
I
remember
one
said
there
were
no
sallets
in
the
lines
to
make
the
matter
savoury
nor
no
matter
in
the
phrase
that
might
indict
the
author
of
affectation
but
calld
it
an
honest
method
as
wholesome
as
sweet
and
by
very
much
more
handsome
than
fine
One
speech
int
I
chiefly
lovd
Twas
AEneas
tale
to
Dido
and
thereabout
of
it
especially
where
he
speaks
of
Priams
slaughter
If
it
live
in
your
memory
begin
at
this
line
let
me
see
let
me
see
The
rugged
Pyrrhus
like
th
Hyrcanian
beast
Tis
not
so
it
begins
with
Pyrrhus
The
rugged
Pyrrhus
he
whose
sable
arms
Black
as
his
purpose
did
the
night
resemble
When
he
lay
couched
in
the
ominous
horse
Hath
now
this
dread
and
black
complexion
smeard
With
heraldry
more
dismal
Head
to
foot
Now
is
be
total
gules
horridly
trickd
With
blood
of
fathers
mothers
daughters
sons
Bakd
and
impasted
with
the
parching
streets
That
lend
a
tyrannous
and
a
damned
light
To
their
lords
murther
Roasted
in
wrath
and
fire
And
thus
oersized
with
coagulate
gore
With
eyes
like
carbuncles
the
hellish
Pyrrhus
Old
grandsire
Priam
seeks
So
proceed
you
Pol
Fore
God
my
lord
well
spoken
with
good
accent
and
good
discretion
Play
Anon
he
finds
him
Striking
too
short
at
Greeks
His
antique
sword
Rebellious
to
his
arm
lies
where
it
falls
Repugnant
to
command
Unequal
matchd
Pyrrhus
at
Priam
drives
in
rage
strikes
wide
But
with
the
whiff
and
wind
of
his
fell
sword
Th
unnerved
father
falls
Then
senseless
Ilium
Seeming
to
feel
this
blow
with
flaming
top
Stoops
to
his
base
and
with
a
hideous
crash
Takes
prisoner
Pyrrhus
ear
For
lo
his
sword
Which
was
declining
on
the
milky
head
Of
reverend
Priam
seemd
i
th
air
to
stick
So
as
a
painted
tyrant
Pyrrhus
stood
And
like
a
neutral
to
his
will
and
matter
Did
nothing
But
as
we
often
see
against
some
storm
silence
in
the
heavens
the
rack
stand
still
The
bold
winds
speechless
and
the
orb
below
As
hush
as
death
anon
the
dreadful
thunder
Doth
rend
the
region
so
after
Pyrrhus
pause
Aroused
vengeance
sets
him
new
awork
And
never
did
the
Cyclops
hammers
fall
On
Marss
armour
forgd
for
proof
eterne
With
less
remorse
than
Pyrrhus
bleeding
sword
Now
falls
on
Priam
Out
out
thou
strumpet
Fortune
All
you
gods
In
general
synod
take
away
her
power
Break
all
the
spokes
and
fellies
from
her
wheel
And
bowl
the
round
nave
down
the
hill
of
heaven
As
low
as
to
the
fiends
Pol
This
is
too
long
Ham
It
shall
to
the
barbers
with
your
beard
Prithee
say
on
Hes
for
a
jig
or
a
tale
of
bawdry
or
he
sleeps
Say
on
come
to
Hecuba
Play
But
who
who
had
seen
the
mobled
queen
Ham
The
mobled
queen
Pol
Thats
good
Mobled
queen
is
good
Play
Run
barefoot
up
and
down
threatning
the
flames
With
bisson
rheum
a
clout
upon
that
head
Where
late
the
diadem
stood
and
for
a
robe
About
her
lank
and
all
oerteemed
loins
blanket
in
the
alarm
of
fear
caught
up
Who
this
had
seen
with
tongue
in
venom
steepd
Gainst
Fortunes
state
would
treason
have
pronouncd
But
if
the
gods
themselves
did
see
her
then
When
she
saw
Pyrrhus
make
malicious
sport
In
Mincing
with
his
sword
her
husbands
limbs
The
instant
burst
of
clamour
that
she
made
Unless
things
mortal
move
them
not
at
all
Would
have
made
milch
the
burning
eyes
of
heaven
And
passion
in
the
gods
Pol
Look
wher
he
has
not
turnd
his
colour
and
has
tears
ins
eyes
Prithee
no
more
Ham
Tis
well
Ill
have
thee
speak
out
the
rest
of
this
soon
Good
my
lord
will
you
see
the
players
well
bestowd
Do
you
hear
Let
them
be
well
usd
for
they
are
the
abstract
and
brief
chronicles
of
the
time
After
your
death
you
were
better
have
a
bad
epitaph
than
their
ill
report
while
you
live
Pol
My
lord
I
will
use
them
according
to
their
desert
Ham
Gods
bodykins
man
much
better
Use
every
man
after
his
desert
and
who
should
scape
whipping
Use
them
after
your
own
honour
and
dignity
The
less
they
deserve
the
more
merit
is
in
your
bounty
Take
them
in
Pol
Come
sirs
Ham
Follow
him
friends
Well
hear
a
play
tomorrow
Dost
thou
hear
me
old
friend
Can
you
play
The
Murther
of
Gonzago
Play
Ay
my
lord
Ham
Well
hat
tomorrow
night
You
could
for
a
need
study
a
speech
of
some
dozen
or
sixteen
lines
which
I
would
set
down
and
insert
int
could
you
not
Play
Ay
my
lord
Ham
Very
well
Follow
that
lord
and
look
you
mock
him
not
My
good
friends
Ill
leave
you
till
night
You
are
welcome
to
Elsinore
Ros
Good
my
lord
Ham
Ay
so
God
b
wi
ye
Now
I
am
alone
what
a
rogue
and
peasant
slave
am
I
Is
it
not
monstrous
that
this
player
here
But
in
a
fiction
in
a
dream
of
passion
Could
force
his
soul
so
to
his
own
conceit
That
from
her
working
all
his
visage
wannd
Tears
in
his
eyes
distraction
ins
aspect
broken
voice
and
his
whole
function
suiting
With
forms
to
his
conceit
And
all
for
nothing
For
Hecuba
Whats
Hecuba
to
him
or
he
to
Hecuba
That
he
should
weep
for
her
What
would
he
do
Had
he
the
motive
and
the
cue
for
passion
That
I
have
He
would
drown
the
stage
with
tears
And
cleave
the
general
ear
with
horrid
speech
Make
mad
the
guilty
and
appal
the
free
Confound
the
ignorant
and
amaze
indeed
The
very
faculties
of
eyes
and
ears
Yet
I
dull
and
muddymettled
rascal
peak
Like
Johnadreams
unpregnant
of
my
cause
And
can
say
nothing
No
not
for
a
king
Upon
whose
property
and
most
dear
life
damnd
defeat
was
made
Am
I
a
coward
Who
calls
me
villain
breaks
my
pate
across
Plucks
off
my
beard
and
blows
it
in
my
face
Tweaks
me
by
th
nose
gives
me
the
lie
i
th
throat
As
deep
as
to
the
lungs
Who
does
me
this
ha
Swounds
I
should
take
it
for
it
cannot
be
But
I
am
pigeonliverd
and
lack
gall
To
make
oppression
bitter
or
ere
this
I
should
have
fatted
all
the
region
kites
With
this
slaves
offal
Bloody
bawdy
villain
Remorseless
treacherous
lecherous
kindless
villain
vengeance
Why
what
an
ass
am
I
This
is
most
brave
That
I
the
son
of
a
dear
father
murtherd
Prompted
to
my
revenge
by
heaven
and
hell
Must
like
a
whore
unpack
my
heart
with
words
And
fall
acursing
like
a
very
drab
scullion
Fie
upont
foh
About
my
brain
Hum
I
have
heard
That
guilty
creatures
sitting
at
a
play
Have
by
the
very
cunning
of
the
scene
Been
struck
so
to
the
soul
that
presently
They
have
proclaimd
their
malefactions
For
murther
though
it
have
no
tongue
will
speak
With
most
miraculous
organ
Ill
have
these
Players
Play
something
like
the
murther
of
my
father
Before
mine
uncle
Ill
observe
his
looks
Ill
tent
him
to
the
quick
If
he
but
blench
I
know
my
course
The
spirit
that
I
have
seen
May
be
a
devil
and
the
devil
hath
power
assume
a
pleasing
shape
yea
and
perhaps
Out
of
my
weakness
and
my
melancholy
As
he
is
very
potent
with
such
spirits
Abuses
me
to
damn
me
Ill
have
grounds
More
relative
than
this
The
plays
the
thing
Wherein
Ill
catch
the
conscience
of
the
King
Scene
I
Elsinore
room
in
the
Castle
Enter
King
Queen
Polonius
Ophelia
Rosencrantz
Guildenstern
and
Lords
King
And
can
you
by
no
drift
of
circumstance
Get
from
him
why
he
puts
on
this
confusion
Grating
so
harshly
all
his
days
of
quiet
With
turbulent
and
dangerous
lunacy
Ros
He
does
confess
he
feels
himself
distracted
But
from
what
cause
he
will
by
no
means
speak
Guil
Nor
do
we
find
him
forward
to
be
sounded
But
with
a
crafty
madness
keeps
aloof
When
we
would
bring
him
on
to
some
confession
Of
his
true
state
Queen
Did
he
receive
you
well
Ros
Most
like
a
gentleman
Guil
But
with
much
forcing
of
his
disposition
Ros
Niggard
of
question
but
of
our
demands
Most
free
in
his
reply
Queen
Did
you
assay
him
To
any
pastime
Ros
Madam
it
so
fell
out
that
certain
players
We
oerraught
on
the
way
Of
these
we
told
him
And
there
did
seem
in
him
a
kind
of
joy
To
hear
of
it
They
are
here
about
the
court
And
as
I
think
they
have
already
order
This
night
to
play
before
him
Pol
Tis
most
true
And
he
beseechd
me
to
entreat
your
Majesties
To
hear
and
see
the
matter
King
With
all
my
heart
and
it
doth
much
content
me
To
hear
him
so
inclind
Good
gentlemen
give
him
a
further
edge
And
drive
his
purpose
on
to
these
delights
Ros
We
shall
my
lord
King
Sweet
Gertrude
leave
us
too
For
we
have
closely
sent
for
Hamlet
hither
That
he
as
twere
by
accident
may
here
Affront
Ophelia
Her
father
and
myself
lawful
espials
Will
so
bestow
ourselves
that
seeing
unseen
We
may
of
their
encounter
frankly
judge
And
gather
by
him
as
he
is
behavd
Ift
be
th
affliction
of
his
love
or
no
That
thus
he
suffers
for
Queen
I
shall
obey
you
And
for
your
part
Ophelia
I
do
wish
That
your
good
beauties
be
the
happy
cause
Of
Hamlets
wildness
So
shall
I
hope
your
virtues
Will
bring
him
to
his
wonted
way
again
To
both
your
honours
Oph
Madam
I
wish
it
may
Pol
Ophelia
walk
you
here
Gracious
so
please
you
We
will
bestow
ourselves
To
Ophelia
Read
on
this
book
That
show
of
such
an
exercise
may
colour
Your
loneliness
We
are
oft
to
blame
in
this
Tis
too
much
provd
that
with
devotions
visage
And
pious
action
we
do
sugar
oer
The
Devil
himself
King
aside
tis
too
true
How
smart
a
lash
that
speech
doth
give
my
conscience
The
harlots
cheek
beautied
with
plastring
art
Is
not
more
ugly
to
the
thing
that
helps
it
Than
is
my
deed
to
my
most
painted
word
heavy
burthen
Pol
I
hear
him
coming
Lets
withdraw
my
lord
Enter
Hamlet
Ham
To
be
or
not
to
be
that
is
the
question
Whether
tis
nobler
in
the
mind
to
suffer
The
slings
and
arrows
of
outrageous
fortune
Or
to
take
arms
against
a
sea
of
troubles
And
by
opposing
end
them
To
die
to
sleep
No
more
and
by
a
sleep
to
say
we
end
The
heartache
and
the
thousand
natural
shocks
That
flesh
is
heir
to
Tis
a
consummation
Devoutly
to
be
wishd
To
die
to
sleep
To
sleep
perchance
to
dream
ay
theres
the
rub
For
in
that
sleep
of
death
what
dreams
may
come
When
we
have
shuffled
off
this
mortal
coil
Must
give
us
pause
Theres
the
respect
That
makes
calamity
of
so
long
life
For
who
would
bear
the
whips
and
scorns
of
time
Th
oppressors
wrong
the
proud
mans
contumely
The
pangs
of
despisd
love
the
laws
delay
The
insolence
of
office
and
the
spurns
That
patient
merit
of
th
unworthy
takes
When
he
himself
might
his
quietus
make
With
a
bare
bodkin
Who
would
these
fardels
bear
To
grunt
and
sweat
under
a
weary
life
But
that
the
dread
of
something
after
death
The
undiscoverd
country
from
whose
bourn
No
traveller
returns
puzzles
the
will
And
makes
us
rather
bear
those
ills
we
have
Than
fly
to
others
that
we
know
not
of
Thus
conscience
does
make
cowards
of
us
all
And
thus
the
native
hue
of
resolution
Is
sicklied
oer
with
the
pale
cast
of
thought
And
enterprises
of
great
pith
and
moment
With
this
regard
their
currents
turn
awry
And
lose
the
name
of
action
Soft
you
now
The
fair
Ophelia
Nymph
in
thy
orisons
Be
all
my
sins
remembred
Oph
Good
my
lord
How
does
your
honour
for
this
many
a
day
Ham
I
humbly
thank
you
well
well
well
Oph
My
lord
I
have
remembrances
of
yours
That
I
have
longed
long
to
redeliver
I
pray
you
now
receive
them
Ham
No
not
I
I
never
gave
you
aught
Oph
My
honourd
lord
you
know
right
well
you
did
And
with
them
words
of
so
sweet
breath
composd
As
made
the
things
more
rich
Their
perfume
lost
Take
these
again
for
to
the
noble
mind
Rich
gifts
wax
poor
when
givers
prove
unkind
There
my
lord
Ham
Ha
ha
Are
you
honest
Oph
My
lord
Ham
Are
you
fair
Oph
What
means
your
lordship
Ham
That
if
you
be
honest
and
fair
your
honesty
should
admit
no
discourse
to
your
beauty
Oph
Could
beauty
my
lord
have
better
commerce
than
with
honesty
Ham
Ay
truly
for
the
power
of
beauty
will
sooner
transform
honesty
from
what
it
is
to
a
bawd
than
the
force
of
honesty
can
translate
beauty
into
his
likeness
This
was
sometime
a
paradox
but
now
the
time
gives
it
proof
I
did
love
you
once
Oph
Indeed
my
lord
you
made
me
believe
so
Ham
You
should
not
have
believd
me
for
virtue
cannot
so
inoculate
our
old
stock
but
we
shall
relish
of
it
I
loved
you
not
Oph
I
was
the
more
deceived
Ham
Get
thee
to
a
nunnery
Why
wouldst
thou
be
a
breeder
of
sinners
I
am
myself
indifferent
honest
but
yet
I
could
accuse
me
of
such
things
that
it
were
better
my
mother
had
not
borne
me
I
am
very
proud
revengeful
ambitious
with
more
offences
at
my
beck
than
I
have
thoughts
to
put
them
in
imagination
to
give
them
shape
or
time
to
act
them
in
What
should
such
fellows
as
I
do
crawling
between
earth
and
heaven
We
are
arrant
knaves
all
believe
none
of
us
Go
thy
ways
to
a
nunnery
Wheres
your
father
Oph
At
home
my
lord
Ham
Let
the
doors
be
shut
upon
him
that
he
may
play
the
fool
nowhere
but
ins
own
house
Farewell
Oph
help
him
you
sweet
heavens
Ham
If
thou
dost

Ill
give
thee
this
plague
for
thy
dowry
be
thou
as
chaste
as
ice
as
pure
as
snow
thou
shalt
not
escape
calumny
Get
thee
to
a
nunnery
Go
farewell
Or
if
thou
wilt
needs
marry
marry
a
fool
for
wise
men
know
well
enough
what
monsters
you
make
of
them
To
a
nunnery
go
and
quickly
too
Farewell
Oph
heavenly
powers
restore
him
Ham
I
have
heard
of
your
paintings
too
well
enough
God
hath
given
you
one
face
and
you
make
yourselves
another
You
jig

make
your
wantonness

ignorance
Go

I
say

will
have
no
moe

Those
that
are
married
already
all
but
one
shall
live
the
rest
shall
keep
as

To

Now

Like

Love

do

Nor
what
he
spake
though
it
lackd
form
a

Was
not

Theres
something
in
his
soul
Oer
which
his
melancholy
sits
on
brood
And
I
do
doubt
the
hatch
and
the
disclose
Will
be
some
danger
which
for
to
prevent
I
have
in
quick
determination
Thus
set
it
down
he
shall
with
speed
to
England
For
the
demand
of
our
neglected
tribute
Haply
the
seas
and
countries
different
With
variable
objects
shall
expel
This
somethingsettled
matter
in
his
heart
Whereon
his
brains
still
beating
puts
him
thus
From
fashion
of
himself
What
think
you
ont
Pol
It
shall
do
well
But
yet
do
I
believe
The
origin
and
commencement
of
his
grief
Sprung
from
neglected
love
How
now
Ophelia
You
need
not
tell
us
what
Lord
Hamlet
said
We
heard
it
all
My
lord
do
as
you
please
But
if
you
hold
it
fit
after
the
play
Let
his
queen
mother
all
alone
entreat
him
To
show
his
grief
Let
her
be
round
with
him
And
Ill
be
placd
so
please
you
in
the
ear
Of
all
their
conference
If
she
find
him
not
To
England
send
him
or
confine
him
where
Your
wisdom
best
shall
think
King
It
shall
be
so
Madness

Scene
Elsinore
hall
in
the
Castle
Enter
Hamlet
and
three
of
the
Players
Ham
Speak
the
speech
I
pray
you
as
I
pronouncd
it
to
you
trippingly
on
the
tongue
But
if
you
mouth
it
as
many
of
our
players
do
I
had
as
live
the
town
crier
spoke
my
lines
Nor
do
not
saw
the
air
too
much
with
your
hand
thus
but
use
all
gently
for
in
the
very
torrent
tempest
and
as
I
may
say
whirlwind
of
your
passion
you
must
acquire
and
beget
a
temperance
that
may
give
it
smoothness
it
offends
me
to
the
soul
to
hear
a
robustious
periwigpated
fellow
tear
a
passion
to
tatters
to
very
rags
to
split
the
cars
of
the
groundlings
who
for
the
most
part
are
capable
of
nothing
but
inexplicable
dumb
shows
and
noise
I
would
have
such
a
fellow
whippd
for
oerdoing
Termagant
It
outherods
Herod
Pray
you
avoid
it
Player
I
warrant
your
honour
Ham
Be
not
too
tame
neither
but
let
your
own
discretion
be
your
tutor
Suit
the
action
to
the
word
the
word
to
the
action
with
this
special
observance
that
you
oerstep
not
the
modesty
of
nature
for
anything
so
overdone
is
from
the
purpose
of
playing
whose
end
both
at
the
first
and
now
was
and
is
to
hold
as
twere
the
mirror
up
to
nature
to
show
Virtue
her
own
feature
scorn
her
own
image
and
the
very
age
and
body
of
the
time
his
form
and
pressure
Now
this
overdone
or
come
tardy
off
though
it
make
the
unskilful
laugh
cannot
but
make
the
judicious
grieve
the
censure
of
the
which
one
must
in
your
allowance
oerweigh
a
whole
theatre
of
others
there
be
players
that
I
have
seen
play
and
heard
others
praise
and
that
highly
not
to
speak
it
profanely
that
neither
having
the
accent
of
Christians
nor
the
gait
of
Christian
pagan
nor
man
have
so
strutted
and
bellowed
that
I
have
thought
some
of
Natures
journeymen
had
made
men
and
not
made
them
well
they
imitated
humanity
so
abominably
Player
I
hope
we
have
reformd
that
indifferently
with
us
sir
Ham
reform
it
altogether
And
let
those
that
play
your
clowns
speak
no
more
than
is
set
down
for
them
For
there
be
of
them
that
will
themselves
laugh
to
set
on
some
quantity
of
barren
spectators
to
laugh
too
though
in
the
mean
time
some
necessary
question
of
the
play
be
then
to
be
considered
Thats
villanous
and
shows
a
most
pitiful
ambition
in
the
fool
that
uses
it
Go
make
you
ready
Enter
Polonius
Rosencrantz
and
Guildenstern
How
now
my
lord
Will
the
King
hear
this
piece
of
work
Pol
And
the
Queen
too
and
that
presently
Ham
Bid
the

help
to
hasten

We

What

Here

Horatio

As

Hor
my
dear

Ham
Nay
do
not

I
flatter
For
what
advancement
may
I
hope
from
thee
That
no
revenue
hast
but
thy
good
spirits
To
feed
and
clothe
thee
Why
should
the
poor
be
flatterd
No
let
the
candied
tongue
lick
absurd
pomp
And
crook
the
pregnant
hinges
of
the
knee
Where
thrift
may
follow
fawning
Dost
thou
hear
Since
my
dear
soul
was
mistress
of
her
choice
And
could
of
men
distinguish
her
election
Hath
scald
thee
for
herself
For
thou
hast
been
As
one
in
suffring
all
that
suffers
nothing
man
that
Fortunes
buffets
and
rewards
Hast
taen
with
equal
thanks
and
blest

Whose
blood
and
judgment

so
well
commingled
That
they
are
not

pipe
for
Fortunes

To
sound
what
stop

Give
me
that
man
That
is
not
passions
slave
and
I
will
wear
him
In
my

do
thee
Something

much

There
is
a
play
tonight
before

One
scene
of
it
comes
near
the
circumstance
Which
I
have
told
thee
of
my
fathers
death

prithee
when
thou
seest
that
act
afoot
Even
with
the
very
comment
of
thy
soul
Observe
my
uncle
If
his
occulted
guilt
Do
not
itself
unkennel
in
one
speech
It
is
a
damned
ghost
that
we
have
seen
And
my
imaginations
are
as
foul
As
Vulcans
stithy
Give
him
heedful
note
For
I
mine
eyes
will
rivet
to
his
face
And
after
we
will
both
our
judgments
join
In
censure
of
his
seeming
Hor
Well

lord
If

steal
aught

And

again
count
oer
ere
love
be
done
But
woe
is
me
you
are
so
sick
of
late
So
far
from
cheer
and
from
your
former
state
That
I
distrust
you
Yet
though
I
distrust
Discomfort
you
my
lord
it
nothing
must
For
womens
fear
and
love
holds
quantity
In
neither
aught
or
in
extremity
Now
what
my
love
is
proof
hath
made
you
know
And
as
my
love
is
sizd
my
fear
is
so
Where
love
is
great
the
littlest
doubts
are
fear
Where
little
fears
grow
great
great
love
grows
there
King
Faith
I
must
leave
thee
love
and
shortly
too
My
operant
powers
their
functions
leave
to
do
And
thou
shalt
live
in
this
fair
world
behind
Honourd
belovd
and
haply
one
as
kind
For
husband
shalt
thou
Queen
confound
the
rest
Such
love
must
needs
be
treason
in
my
breast
When
second
husband
let
me
be
accurst
None
wed
the
second
but
who
killed
the
first
Ham
aside
Wormwood
wormwood
Queen
The
instances
that
second
marriage
move
Are
base
respects
of
thrift
but
none
of
love
second
time
I
kill
my
husband
dead
When
second
husband
kisses
me
in
bed
King
I
do
believe
you
think
what
now
you
speak
But
what
we
do
determine
oft
we
break
Purpose
is
but
the
slave
to
memory
Of
violent
birth
but
poor
validity
Which
now
like
fruit
unripe
sticks
on
the
tree
But
fill
unshaken
when
they
mellow
be
Most
necessary
tis
that
we
forget
To
pay
ourselves
what
to
ourselves
is
debt
What
to
ourselves
in
passion
we
propose
The
passion
ending
doth
the
purpose
lose
The
violence
of
either
grief
or
joy
Their
own
enactures
with
themselves
destroy
Where
joy
most
revels
grief
doth
most
lament
Grief
joys
joy
grieves
on
slender
accident
This
world
is
not
for
aye
nor
tis
not
strange
That
even
our
loves
should
with
our
fortunes
change
For
tis
a
question
left
us
yet
to
prove
Whether
love
lead
fortune
or
else
fortune
love
The
great
man
down
you
mark
his
favourite
flies
The
poor
advancd
makes
friends
of
enemies
And
hitherto
doth
love
on
fortune
tend
For
who
not
needs
shall
never
lack
a
friend
And
who
in
want
a
hollow
friend
doth
try
Directly
seasons
him
his
enemy
But
orderly
to
end
where
I
begun
Our
wills
and
fates
do
so
contrary
run
That
our
devices
still
are
overthrown
Our
thoughts
are
ours
their
ends
none
of
our
own
So
think
thou
wilt
no
second
husband
wed
But
die
thy
thoughts
when
thy
first
lord
is
dead
Queen
Nor
earth
to
me
give
food
nor
heaven
light
Sport
and
repose
lock
from
me
day
and
night
To
desperation
turn
my
trust
and
hope
An
anchors
cheer
in
prison
be
my
scope
Each
opposite
that
blanks
the
face
of
joy
Meet
what
I
would
have
well
and
it
destroy
Both
here
and
hence
pursue
me
lasting
strife
If
once
a
widow
ever
I
be
wife
Ham
If
she
should
break
it
now
King
Tis
deeply
sworn
Sweet
leave
me
here
awhile
My
spirits
grow
dull

fain
I

The
tedious

Sleep

Ay

Guil
Is

marvellous
distemperd

With

sir
Guil
No
my

with
choler

Your
wisdom
should
show
itself
more
richer
to
signify
this
to
the
doctor
for
me
to
put
him
to
his
purgation
would
perhaps
plunge
him
into
far
more
choler
Guil
Good
my

put
your
discourse
into
some
frame

start
not
so
wildly

my
affair

I

The

your

great
affliction

You

Nay
good
my

this
courtesy
is
not
of
the
right
breed
If
it
shall
please
you
to
make
me
a
wholesome
answer
I
will
do
your
mothers
commandment

not
your
pardon

my

Sir
I
cannot

What
my

Make

But
sir
such
answer
is
I
can
make
you
shall
command
or
rather
as
you
say
my
mother
Therefore
no
more
but
to
the

My

she
says
your

struck

stonish

And

Ros
Good
my

what
is
your
cause
of
distemper
You
do
surely
bar
the
door
upon
your
own
liberty
if
you
deny
your
griefs
to
your
friend
Ham
Sir
I
lack
advancement

How
can
that
be

you
have
the
voice

the
King
himself

your
succession

Denmark

musty

easy

you
these

the
stops

But
these
cannot
I
command
to
any
uttrance
of
harmony
I
have
not
the
skill
Ham
Why
look
you
now
how
unworthy
a
thing
you
make
of
me
You
would
play
upon
me
you
would
seem
to
know
my
stops
you
would
pluck
out
the
heart
of
my
mystery
you
would
sound
me
from
my
lowest
note
to
the
top
of
my
compass

there
is
much
music

this
little
organ

cannot
you
make
it
speak
Sblood
do
you
think
I
am
easier
to
be
playd
on

will

you
can
fret
me
you
cannot
play
upon
me

By

not
Though
inclination
be

My

defeats
my
strong

pause

I

begin
And
both
neglect
What
if

cursed
hand
Were
thicker
than
itself

brothers
blood
Is
there
not
rain
enough
in
the
sweet
heavens
To
wash
it
white
as
snow
Whereto
serves
mercy
But
to
confront
the
visage
of
offence
And
whats
in
prayer
but
this
twofold
force
To
be
forestalled
ere
we
come
to
fall
Or
pardond
being
down
Then
Ill
look
up
My
fault

But
what
form
of

Can
serve
my

Forgive
me
my
foul
murther

Of

father

Ham
Mother

my
father
much
offended
Queen
Come

an
idle
tongue
Ham
Go

a
wicked
tongue
Queen
Why

Hamlet
Ham
Whats
the
matter

Queen
Have

Ham
No
by
the
rood

You

the
Queen
your
husbands
brothers
wife
And
would
it
were
not
so
you
are
my
mother
Queen
Nay
then
Ill
set
those
to
you
that
can
speak
Ham
Come
come
and
sit
you
down
You
shall
not
budge
I
You
go
not
till
I
set
you
up
a
glass
Where
you
may
see
the
inmost
part
of
you
Queen
What
wilt
thou
do
Thou
wilt
not
murther
me
Help
help
ho
Pol
behind
What
ho
help
help
help
Ham
draws
How
now
a
rat
Dead
for
a
ducat
dead
Makes
a
pass
through
the
arras
and
kills
Polonius
Pol
behind
I
am
slain
Queen
me
what
hast
thou
done
Ham
Nay
I
know
not
Is
it
the
King
Queen
what
a
rash
and
bloody
deed
is
this
Ham
bloody
deed
almost
as
bad
good
mother
As
kill
a
king
and
marry
with
his
brother
Queen
As
kill
a
king
Ham
Ay
lady
it
was
my
word
Lifts
up
the
arras
and
sees
Polonius
Thou
wretched
rash
intruding
fool
farewell
I
took
thee
for
thy
better
Take
thy
fortune
Thou
findst
to
be
too
busy
is
some
danger
Leave
wringing
of
your
hinds
Peace
sit
you
down
And
let
me
wring
your
heart
for
so
I
shall
If
it
be
made
of
penetrable
stuff
If
damned
custom
have
not
brazd
it
so
That
it
is
proof
and
bulwark
against
sense
Queen
What
have
I
done
that
thou
darst
wag
thy
tongue
In
noise
so
rude
against
me
Ham
Such
an
act
That
blurs
the
grace
and
blush
of
modesty
Calls
virtue
hypocrite
takes
off
the
rose
From
the
fair
forehead
of
an
innocent
love
And
sets
a
blister
there
makes
marriage
vows
As
false
as
dicers
oaths
such
a
deed
As
from
the
body
of
contraction
plucks
The
very
soul
and
sweet
religion
makes
rhapsody
of
words
Heavens
face
doth
glow
Yea
this
solidity
and
compound
mass
With
tristful
visage
as
against
the
doom
Is
thoughtsick
at
the
act
Queen
Ay
me
what
act
That
roars
so
loud
and
thunders
in
the
index
Ham
Look
here
upon
ths
picture
and
on
this
The
counterfeit
presentment
of
two
brothers
See
what
a
grace
was
seated
on
this
brow
Hyperions
curls
the
front
of
Jove
himself
An
eye
like
Mars
to
threaten
and
command
station
like
the
herald
Mercury
New
lighted
on
a
heavenkissing
hill
combination
and
a
form
indeed
Where
every
god
did
seem
to
set
his
seal
To
give
the
world
assurance
of
a
man
This
was
your
husband
Look
you
now
what
follows
Here
is
your
husband
like
a
mildewd
ear
Blasting
his
wholesome
brother
Have
you
eyes
Could
you
on
this
fair
mountain
leave
to
feed
And
batten
on
this
moor
Ha
have
you
eyes
You
cannot
call
it
love
for
at
your
age
The
heyday
in
the
blood
is
tame
its
humble
And
waits
upon
the
judgment
and
what
judgment
Would
step
from
this
to
this
Sense
sure
you
have
Else
could
you
not
have
motion
but
sure
that
sense
Is
apoplexd
for
madness
would
not
err
Nor
sense
to
ecstacy
was
neer
so
thralld
But
it
reservd
some
quantity
of
choice
To
serve
in
such
a
difference
What
devil
wast
That
thus
hath
cozend
you
at
hoodmanblind
Eyes
without
feeling
feeling
without
sight
Ears
without
hands
or
eyes
smelling
sans
all
Or
but
a
sickly
part
of
one
true
sense
Could
not
so
mope
shame
where
is
thy
blush
Rebellious
hell
If
thou
canst
mutine
in
a
matrons
bones
To
flaming
youth
let
virtue
be
as
wax
And
melt
in
her
own
fire
Proclaim
no
shame
When
the
compulsive
ardour
gives
the
charge
Since
frost
itself
as
actively
doth
burn
And
reason
panders
will
Queen
Hamlet
speak
no
more
Thou
turnst
mine
eyes
into
my
very
soul
And
there
I
see
such
black
and
grained
spots
As
will
not
leave
their
tinct
Ham
Nay
but
to
live
In
the
rank
sweat
of
an
enseamed
bed
Stewd
in
corruption
honeying
and
making
love
Over
the
nasty
sty
Queen
speak
to
me
no
more
These
words
like
daggers
enter
in
mine
ears
No
more
sweet
Hamlet
Ham
murtherer
and
a
villain
slave
that
is
not
twentieth
part
the
tithe
Of
your
precedent
lord
a
vice
of
kings
cutpurse
of
the
empire
and
the
rule
That
from
a
shelf
the
precious
diadem
stole
And
put
it
in
his
pocket
Queen
No
more
Enter
the
Ghost
in
his
nightgown
Ham
king
of
shreds
and
patches
Save
me
and
hover
oer
me
with
your
wings
You
heavenly
guards
What
would
your
gracious
figure
Queen
Alas
hes
mad
Ham
Do
you
not
come
your
tardy
son
to
chide
That
lapsd
in
time
and
passion
lets
go
by
Th
important
acting
of
your
dread
command
say
Ghost
Do
not
forget
This
visitation
Is
but
to
whet
thy
almost
blunted
purpose
But
look
amazement
on
thy
mother
sits
step
between
her
and
her
fighting
soul
Conceit
in
weakest
bodies
strongest
works
Speak
to
her
Hamlet
Ham
How
is
it
with
you
lady
Queen
Alas
how
ist
with
you
That
you
do
bend
your
eye
on
vacancy
And
with
th
encorporal
air
do
hold
discourse
Forth
at
your
eyes
your
spirits
wildly
peep
And
as
the
sleeping
soldiers
in
th
alarm
Your
bedded
hairs
like
life
in
excrements
Start
up
and
stand
an
end
gentle
son
Upon
the
beat
and
flame
of
thy
distemper
Sprinkle
cool
patience
Whereon
do
you
look
Ham
On
him
on
him
Look
you
how
pale
he
glares
His
form
and
cause
conjoind
preaching
to
stones
Would
make
them
capable
Do
not
look
upon
me
Lest
with
this
piteous
action
you
convert
My
stern
effects
Then
what
I
have
to
do
Will
want
true
colour
tears
perchance
for
blood
Queen
To
whom
do
you
speak
this
Ham
Do
you
see
nothing
there
Queen
Nothing
at
all
yet
all
that
is
I
see
Ham
Nor
did
you
nothing
hear
Queen
No
nothing
but
ourselves
Ham
Why
look
you
there
Look
how
it
steals
away
My
father
in
his
habit
as
he
livd
Look
where
he
goes
even
now
out
at
the
portal
Queen
This
is
the
very
coinage
of
your
brain
This
bodiless
creation
ecstasy
Is
very
cunning
in
Ham
Ecstasy
My
pulse
as
yours
doth
temperately
keep
time
And
makes
as
healthful
music
It
is
not
madness
That
I
have
uttred
Bring
me
to
the
test
And
I
the
matter
will
reword
which
madness
Would
gambol
from
Mother
for
love
of
grace
Lay
not
that
flattering
unction
to
your
soul
That
not
your
trespass
but
my
madness
speaks
It
will
but
skin
and
film
the
ulcerous
place
Whiles
rank
corruption
mining
all
within
Infects
unseen
Confess
yourself
to
heaven
Repent
whats
past
avoid
what
is
to
come
And
do
not
spread
the
compost
on
the
weeds
To
make
them
ranker
Forgive
me
this
my
virtue
For
in
the
fatness
of
these
pursy
times
Virtue
itself
of
vice
must
pardon
beg
Yea
curb
and
woo
for
leave
to
do
him
good
Queen
Hamlet
thou
hast
cleft
my
heart
in
twain
Ham
throw
away
the
worser
part
of
it
And
live
the
purer
with
the
other
half
Good
night
but
go
not
to
my
uncles
bed
Assume
a
virtue
if
you
have
it
not
That
monster
custom
who
all
sense
doth
eat
Of
habits
evil
is
angel
yet
in
this
That
to
the
use
of
actions
fair
and
good
He
likewise
gives
a
frock
or
livery
That
aptly
is
put
on
Refrain
tonight
And
that
shall
lend
a
kind
of
easiness
To
the
next
abstinence
the
next
more
easy
For
use
almost
can
change
the
stamp
of
nature
And
either
master
the
devil
or
throw
him
out
With
wondrous
potency
Once
more
good
night
And
when
you
are
desirous
to
be
blest
Ill
blessing
beg
of
you
For
this
same
lord
I
do
repent
but
heaven
hath
pleasd
it
so
To
punish
me
with
this
and
this
with
me
That
I
must
be
their
scourge
and
minister
I
will
bestow
him
and
will
answer
well
The
death
I
gave
him
So
again
good
night
I
must
be
cruel
only
to
be
kind
Thus
bad
begins
and
worse
remains
behind
One
word
more
good
lady
Queen
What
shall
I
do
Ham
Not
this
by
no
means
that
I
bid
you
do
Let
the
bloat
King
tempt
you
again
to
bed
Pinch
wanton
on
your
cheek
call
you
his
mouse
And
let
him
for
a
pair
of
reechy
kisses
Or
paddling
in
your
neck
with
his
damnd
fingers
Make
you
to
ravel
all
this
matter
out
That
I
essentially
am
not
in
madness
But
mad
in
craft
Twere
good
you
let
him
know
For
who
thats
but
a
queen
fair
sober
wise
Would
from
a
paddock
from
a
bat
a
gib
Such
dear
concernings
hide
Who
would
do
so
No
in
despite
of
sense
and
secrecy
Unpeg
the
basket
on
the
houses
top
Let
the
birds
fly
and
like
the
famous
ape
To
try
conclusions
in
the
basket
creep
And
break
your
own
neck
down
Queen
Be
thou
assurd
if
words
be
made
of
breath
And
breath
of
life
I
have
no
life
to
breathe
What
thou
hast
said

Alack

Theres

schoolfellows
Whom

trust
as

They
bear
the
mandate
they
must
sweep
my
way
And
marshal
me
to
knavery
Let
it
work
For
tis
the
sport
to
have
the
enginer
Hoist
with
his
own
petar
and
t
shall
go
hard
But
I
will
delve
one
yard
below
their
mines
And
blow
them
at
the
moon
tis
most
sweet
When
in
one
line
two
crafts
directly
meet
This
man
shall
set
me
packing
Ill
lug
the
guts
into
the
neighbour

Mother
good
night
Indeed
this
counsellor
Is
now
most
still
most
secret
and
most
grave
Who

Mad

mightier
In

Behind

hearing
something

Whips
out
his
rapier
cries
rat

And
in

brainish
apprehension
kills
The
unseen
good
old

heavy
deed
It

had
we
been
there
His
liberty
is
full
of
threats

To

Alas
how

this
bloody
deed
be

It
will
be
laid
to
us
whose
providence
Should
have
kept
short
restraind
and
out
of

This
mad
young
man
But
so
much
was
our
love
We
would
not
understand
what
was
most
fit
But
like
the
owner
of
a
foul
disease
To
keep
it
from
divulging
let
it
feed
Even
on
the
pith
of
life
Where
is
he
gone
Queen
To
draw
apart
the
body

hath
killd
Oer

his
very
madness
like
some

Among

Shows

He
weeps
for
what
is
done
King

The

But
we

Both
countenance

For

With
fiery
quickness
Therefore

The

As

Since

After
the
Danish
sword
and
thy
free

Pays
homage
to

thou
mayst
not
coldly
set
Our
sovereign
process
which

By

The

Hamlet
Do

For

And

Truly
to

with
no

We
go

a

That

To

I
would

Capt
Yes
it
is
already
garrisond
Ham
Two
thousand
souls

twenty
thousand

Will
not
debate
the
question
of
this
straw
This
is
th
imposthume
of
much
wealth
and
peace
That
inward
breaks
and
shows
no
cause
without
Why
the
man
dies
I
humbly

How
all

And

What
is
a

If

of
his

Be
but
to
sleep
and
feed
beast
no

Sure
he
that
made

with
such
large
discourse
Looking
before

after
gave
us
not
That
capability
and
godlike
reason
To
fust

Now
whether
it
be
Bestial
oblivion
or
some
craven
scruple
Of
thinking
too
precisely
on
th

And
ever

Why

This

I

To

Examples

Witness
this

Led
by
a
delicate

Whose
spirit
with
divine
ambition

Makes
mouths
at
the
invisible

Exposing
what
is
mortal
and
unsure
To
all
that
fortune
death
and
danger
dare
Even
for
an
eggshell
Rightly
to
be
great
Is
not
to

without
great

But
greatly
to

quarrel

When

How

That

Excitements

And

to
my

I
see
The
imminent
death
of
twenty
thousand
men
That
for
a
fantasy
and
trick
of

Go
to
their
graves
like
beds
fight
for
a

Whereon
the

cannot
try
the

Which
is
not
tomb

To
hide

Spurns
enviously
at

That

Her

Yet
the
unshaped
use
of
it
doth
move
The
hearers
to
collection
they
aim
at
it
And
botch
the
words
up
fit
to
their
own
thoughts
Which
as
her
winks

yield
them
Indeed

their
prisoner
They
have
dealt
with
me
like
thieves
of
mercy
but
they
knew
what
they
did
I
am
to
do
a
good
turn
for
them
Let
the
King
have
the
letters
I
have
sent
and
repair
thou
to
me
with
as
much
speed
as
thou
wouldst
fly
death
I
have
words
to
speak
in
thine
ear
will
make
thee
dumb
yet
are
they
much
too
light
for
the
bore
of
the
matter
These
good
fellows
will
bring
thee
where
I
am
Rosencrantz
and
Guildenstern
hold
their
course
for
England
Of
them
I
have
much
to
tell
thee
Farewell
He
that
thou
knowest
thine
Come
I
will
give
you
way
for
these
your
letters
And
dot
the
speedier
that
you
may
direct
me
To
him
from
whom
you
brought
them
Scene
Elsinore
Another
room
in
the
Castle
Enter
King
and
Laertes
King
Now
must
your
conscience
my
acquittance
seal
And
You
must
put
me
in
your
heart
for
friend
Sith
you
have
heard
and
with
a
knowing
ear
That
he
which
hath
your
noble
father
slain
Pursued
my
life
Laer
It
well
appears
But
tell
me
Why
you
proceeded
not
against
these
feats
So
crimeful
and
so
capital
in
nature
As
by
your
safety
wisdom
all
things
else
You
mainly
were
stirrd
up
King
for
two
special
reasons
Which
may
to
you
perhaps
seein
much
unsinewd
But
yet
to
me
they
are
strong
The
Queen
his
mother
Lives
almost
by
his
looks
and
for
myself
My
virtue
or
my
plague
be
it
either
which
Shes
so
conjunctive
to
my
life
and
soul
That
as
the
star
moves
not
but
in
his
sphere
I
could
not
but
by
her
The
other
motive
Why
to
a
public
count
I
might
not
go
Is
the
great
love
the
general
gender
bear
him
Who
dipping
all
his
faults
in
their
affection
Would
like
the
spring
that
turneth
wood
to
stone
Convert
his
gives
to
graces
so
that
my
arrows
Too
slightly
timberd
for
so
loud
a
wind
Would
have
reverted
to
my
bow
again
And
not
where
I
had
aimd
them
Laer
And
so
have
I
a
noble
father
lost
sister
driven
into
desprate
terms
Whose
worth
if
praises
may
go
back
again
Stood
challenger
on
mount
of
all
the
age
For
her
perfections
But
my
revenge
will
come
King
Break
not
your
sleeps
for
that
You
must
not
think
That
we
are
made
of
stuff
so
flat
and
dull
That
we
can
let
our
beard
be
shook
with
danger
And
think
it
pastime
You
shortly
shall
hear
more
I
lovd
your
father
and
we
love
ourself
And
that
I
hope
will
teach
you
to
imagine
Enter
a
Messenger
with
letters
How
now
What
news
Mess
Letters
my
lord
from
Hamlet
This
to
your
Majesty
this
to
the
Queen
King
From
Hamlet
Who
brought
them
Mess
Sailors
my
lord
they
say
I
saw
them
not
They
were
given
me
by
Claudio
he
receivd
them
Of
him
that
brought
them
King
Laertes
you
shall
hear
them
Leave
us
ReadsHigh
and
MightyYou
shall
know
I
am
set
naked
on
your
kingdom
Tomorrow
shall
I
beg
leave
to
see
your
kingly
eyes
when
I
shall
first
asking
your
pardon
thereunto
recount
the
occasion
of
my
sudden
and
more
strange
return
What
should
this
mean
Are
all
the
rest
come
back
Or
is
it
some
abuse
and
no
such
thing
Laer
Know
you
the
hand
King
Tis
Hamlets
character
Naked
And
in
a
postscript
here
he
says
alone
Can
you
advise
me
Laer
I
am
lost
in
it
my
lord
But
let
him
come
It
warms
the
very
sickness
in
my
heart
That
I
shall
live
and
tell
him
to
his
teeth
Thus
didest
thou
King
If
it
be
so
Laertes
As
how
should
it
be
so
how
otherwise
Will
you
be
ruld
by
me
Laer
Ay
my
lord
So
you
will
not
oerrule
me
to
a
peace
King
To
thine
own
peace
If
he
be
now
returnd
As
checking
at
his
voyage
and
that
he
means
No
more
to
undertake
it
I
will
work
him
To
exploit
now
ripe
in
my
device
Under
the
which
he
shall
not
choose
but
fall
And
for
his
death
no
wind
But
even
his
mother
shall
uncharge
the
practice
And
call
it
accident
Laer
My
lord
I
will
be
ruld
The
rather
if
you
could
devise
it
so
That
I
might
be
the
organ
King
It
falls
right
You
have
been
talkd
of
since
your
travel
much
And
that
in
Hamlets
hearing
for
a
quality
Wherein
they
say
you
shine
Your
sun
of
parts
Did
not
together
pluck
such
envy
from
him
As
did
that
one
and
that
in
my
regard
Of
the
unworthiest
siege
Laer
What
part
is
that
my
lord
King
very
riband
in
the
cap
of
youth
Yet
needfull
too
for
youth
no
less
becomes
The
light
and
careless
livery
that
it
wears
Thin
settled
age
his
sables
and
his
weeds
Importing
health
and
graveness
Two
months
since
Here
was
a
gentleman
of
Normandy
I
have
seen
myself
and
servd
against
the
French
And
they
can
well
on
horseback
but
this
gallant
Had
witchcraft
int
He
grew
unto
his
seat
And
to
such
wondrous
doing
brought
his
horse
As
had
he
been
incorpsd
and
deminaturd
With
the
brave
beast
So
far
he
toppd
my
thought
That
I
in
forgery
of
shapes
and
tricks
Come
short
of
what
he
did
Laer
Norman
wast
King
Norman
Laer
Upon
my
life
Lamound
King
The
very
same
Laer
I
know
him
well
He
is
the
broach
indeed
And
gem
of
all
the
nation
King
He
made
confession
of
you
And
gave
you
such
a
masterly
report
For
art
and
exercise
in
your
defence
And
for
your
rapier
most
especially
That
he
cried
out
twould
be
a
sight
indeed
If
one
could
match
you
The
scrimers
of
their
nation
He
swore
had
neither
motion
guard
nor
eye
If
you
opposd
them
Sir
this
report
of
his
Did
Hamlet
so
envenom
with
his
envy
That
he
could
nothing
do
but
wish
and
beg
Your
sudden
coming
oer
to
play
with
you
Now
out
of
this
Laer
What
out
of
this
my
lord
King
Laertes
was
your
father
dear
to
you
Or
are
you
like
the
painting
of
a
sorrow
face
without
a
heart
Laer
Why
ask
you
this
King
Not
that
I
think
you
did
not
love
your
father
But
that
I
know
love
is
begun
by
time
And
that
I
see
in
passages
of
proof
Time
qualifies
the
spark
and
fire
of
it
There
lives
within
the
very
flame
of
love
kind
of
wick
or
snuff
that
will
abate
it
And
nothing
is
at
a
like
goodness
still
For
goodness
growing
to
a
plurisy
Dies
in
his
own
toomuch
That
we
would
do
We
should
do
when
we
would
for
this
would
changes
And
hath
abatements
and
delays
as
many
As
there
are
tongues
are
hands
are
accidents
And
then
this
should
is
like
a
spendthrift
sigh
That
hurts
by
easing
But
to
the
quick
o
th
ulcer
Hamlet
comes
back
What
would
you
undertake
To
show
yourself
your
fathers
son
in
deed
More
than
in
words
Laer
To
cut
his
throat
i
th
church
King
No
place
indeed
should
murther
sanctuarize
Revenge
should
have
no
bounds
But
good
Laertes
Will
you
do
this
Keep
close
within
your
chamber
Will
returnd
shall
know
you
are
come
home
Well
put
on
those
shall
praise
your
excellence
And
set
a
double
varnish
on
the
fame
The
Frenchman
gave
you
bring
you
in
fine
together
And
wager
on
your
heads
He
being
remiss
Most
generous
and
free
from
all
contriving
Will
not
peruse
the
foils
so
that
with
ease
Or
with
a
little
shuffling
you
may
choose
sword
unbated
and
in
a
pass
of
practice
Requite
him
for
your
father
Laer
I
will
dot
And
for
that
purpose
Ill
anoint
my
sword
I
bought
an
unction
of
a
mountebank
So
mortal
that
but
dip
a
knife
in
it
Where
it
draws
blood
no
cataplasm
so
rare
Collected
from
all
simples
that
have
virtue
Under
the
moon
can
save
the
thing
from
death
This
is
but
scratchd
withal
Ill
touch
my
point
With
this
contagion
that
if
I
gall
him
slightly
It
may
be
death
King
Lets
further
think
of
this
Weigh
what
convenience
both
of
time
and
means
May
fit
us
to
our
shape
If
this
should
fall
And
that
our
drift
look
through
our
bad
performance
Twere
better
not
assayd
Therefore
this
project
Should
have
a
back
or
second
that
might
hold
If
this
did
blast
in
proof
Soft
let
me
see
Well
make
a
solemn
wager
on
your
cunnings
I
hat
When
in
your
motion
you
are
hot
and
dry
As
make
your
bouts
more
violent
to
that
end
And
that
he
calls
for
drink
Ill
have
prepard
him
chalice
for
the
nonce
whereon
but
sipping
If
he
by
chance
escape
your
venomd
stuck
Our
purpose
may
hold
there
But
stay
what
noise
Enter
Queen
How
now
sweet
queen
Queen
One
woe
doth
tread
upon
anothers
heel
So
fast
they
follow
Your
sisters
drownd
Laertes
Laer
Drownd
where
Queen
There
is
a
willow
grows
aslant
a
brook
That
shows
his
hoar
leaves
in
the
glassy
stream
There
with
fantastic
garlands
did
she
come
Of
crowflowers
nettles
daisies
and
long
purples
That
liberal
shepherds
give
a
grosser
name
But
our
cold
maids
do
dead
mens
fingers
call
them
There
on
the
pendant
boughs
her
coronet
weeds
Clambring
to
hang
an
envious
sliver
broke
When
down
her
weedy
trophies
and
herself
Fell
in
the
weeping
brook
Her
clothes
spread
wide
And
mermaidlike
awhile
they
bore
her
up
Which
time
she
chaunted
snatches
of
old
tunes
As
one
incapable
of
her
own
distress
Or
like
a
creature
native
and
indued
Unto
that
element
but
long
it
could
not
be
Till
that
her
garments
heavy
with
their
drink
Pulld
the
poor
wretch
from
her
melodious
lay
To
muddy
death
Laer
Alas
then
she
is
drownd
Queen
Drownd
drownd
Laer
Too
much
of
water
hast
thou
poor
Ophelia
And
therefore
I
forbid
my
tears
but
yet
It
is
our
trick
nature
her
custom
holds
Let
shame
say
what
it
will
When
these
are
gone
The
woman
will
be
out
Adieu
my
lord
I
have
a
speech
of
fire
that
fain
would
blaze
But
that
this
folly
douts
it
King
Lets
follow
Gertrude
How
much
I
had
to
do
to
calm
his
rage
I
Now
fear
I
this
will
give
it
start
again
Therefore
lets
follow
Scene
I
Elsinore
churchyard
Enter
two
Clowns
with
spades
and
pickaxes
Clown
Is
she
to
be
buried
in
Christian
burial
when
she
wilfully
seeks
her
own
salvation
Other
I
tell
thee
she
is
therefore
make
her
grave
straight
The
crowner
hath
sate
on
her
and
finds
it
Christian
burial
Clown
How
can
that
be
unless
she
drownd
herself
in
her
own
defence
Other
Why
tis
found
so
Clown
It
must
be
se
offendendo
it
cannot
be
else
For
here
lies
the
point
if
I
drown
myself
wittingly
it
argues
an
act
and
an
act
hath
three
branchesit
is
to
act
to
do
and
to
perform
argal

drownd
herself
wittingly
Other
Nay

Clown
Give

If
the
man
go
to
this
water
and
drown
himself
it
is
will
he
nill
he
he
goes
mark
you
that
But
if
the
water
come
to
him
and
drown
him
he
drowns
not
himself
Argal
he
that
is
not
guilty
of
his
own
death
shortens
not
his
own
life
Other
But
is
this
law
Clown
Ay

Other
Will
you
ha
the
truth
ant
If
this
had
not
been
a
gentlewoman
she
should
have
been
buried
out
o
Christian
burial
Clown
Why
there
thou
sayst
And
the
more
pity
that
great
folk
should
have
countnance
in
this
world
to
drown
or
hang
themselves
more
than
their
evenChristen
Come
my
spade
There
is
no
ancient
gentlemen
but
gardners
ditchers
and
gravemakers
They
hold
up
Adams
profession
Other
Was
he
a
gentleman
Clown
was
the
first
that
ever
bore
arms
Other
Why
he
had
none
Clown
What
art
a
heathen
How
dost
thou
understand
the
Scripture
The
Scripture
says
Adam
diggd
Could
he
dig
without
arms
Ill
put
another
question
to
thee
If
thou
answerest
me
not
to
the
purpose
confess
thyself
Other
Go
to
Clown
What
is
he
that
builds
stronger
than
either
the
mason
the
shipwright
or
the
carpenter
Other
The
gallowsmaker
for
that
frame
outlives
a
thousand
tenants
Clown
I
like
thy
wit
well
in
good
faith
The
gallows
does
well
But
how
does
it
well
It
does
well
to
those
that
do
ill
Now
thou
dost
ill
to
say
the
gallows
is
built
stronger
than
the
church
Argal
the
gallows
may
do
well
to
thee
Tot
again
come
Other
Who
builds
stronger
than
a
mason

They

this
fellow
Whose

Clown
Mine

Sings

For

Clown
You

For

Thou

For

Who

Ham
How
absolute

We
must
speak
by
the
card
or
equivocation
will
undo
us
By
the
Lord
Horatio
this
three
years
I
have
taken
note
of
it
the
age
is
grown
so
picked
that
the
toe
of
the
peasant
comes
so
near
the
heel
of
the
courtier
he
galls
his
kibe
How
long
hast
thou
been
a
gravemaker
Clown
Of
all
the
days
i
th
year
I
came
tot
that
day
that
our
last
king
Hamlet
overcame
Fortinbras
Ham
How
long
is
that
since
Clown
Cannot
you
tell
that
Every
fool
can
tell
that
It
was
the
very
day
that
young
Hamlet
was
born
he
that
is
mad
and
sent
into
England
Ham
Ay

why
was
be
sent
into
England
Clown
Why
because

Ham
Why
Clown
Twill

There

How

Upon

Why

Ham
How

th
earth
ere

rot
Clown
Faith
if

not
rotten
before
a
die
as
we
have
many
pocky
corses
nowadays
that

scarce
hold
the

I

last
you
some
eight
year
or
nine
year
tanner
will

Ham
Why

more
than
another
Clown
Why

Takes

Alas

Horatio
fellow
of
infinite
jest
of
most
excellent
fancy
He
hath
borne
me
on
his
back
a
thousand
tunes
And
now
how
abhorred
in
my
imagination
it
is
My
gorge
rises
at
it
Here
hung
those
lips
that
I
have
kissd
I
know
not
how
oft
Where
be
your
gibes
now
your
gambols
your
songs
your
flashes
of
merriment
that
were
wont
to
set

roar
Not

Now

Prithee

Whats

Dost

Puts

Een
so
my
lord
Ham
To
what
base
uses
we
may
return
Horatio
Why
may

imagination
trace
the
noble
dust
of
Alexander
till
he
find
it
stopping
a
bunghole
Hor
Twere
to
consider
too
curiously
to
consider
so
Ham
No
faith
not
a
jot
but
to
follow
him
thither
with
modesty
enough
and
likelihood
to
lead
it
as
thus
Alexander
died
Alexander
was
buried
Alexander
returneth
into
dust
the
dust
is
earth
of
earth
we
make
loam
and
why
of
that
loam
whereto
he
was
converted
might
they
not
stop
a
beer
barrel
Imperious
Caesar
dead
and
turnd
to
clay
Might
stop
a
hole
to
keep
the
wind
away
that
that
earth
which
kept
the
world
in
awe
Should
patch
a
wall

But

Here

Enter

And

What

Priest
Her
obsequies
have
been
as
far

As

Her

And

that
great

She
should

unsanctified
have
lodgd
Till
the
last

For

Her

Of

Laer
Must

Priest
No

We
should
profane
the

To

and
such
rest
to

As
to
peaceparted

Laer
Lay

And

I
hopd
thou

And

Fall

Whose
wicked

thy

Deprivd

Hold

Till
I
have
caught

arms
Leaps
in

Now
pile
your

upon
the
quick

dead
Till
of
this
flat
a
mountain

have
made

Pelion
or

Of

Ham
comes
forward
What
is
he
whose
grief
Bears
such
an
emphasis
whose
phrase
of
sorrow
Conjures
the
wandring
stars
and
makes
them
stand
Like

This

The

Grapples

Ham
Thou
prayst
not
well
I
prithee
take
thy
fingers
from
my
throat
For
though
I
am
not
splenitive
and
rash
Yet
have
I
in
me
something
dangerous
Which
let
thy
wisdom
fear
Hold
off

King
Pluck

Queen
Hamlet
Hamlet
All
Gentlemen
Hor
Good
my
lord
be
quiet
The
Attendants
part

and
they
come
out
of
the
grave
Ham
Why
I
will
fight
with
him
upon
this
theme
Until
my
eyelids
will
no
longer
wag
Queen
my
son
what
theme
Ham
I
lovd
Ophelia
Forty
thousand

Could
not

their

of

Make
up
my
sum
What
wilt

For

To
outface
me
with
leaping
in
her
grave
Be
buried
quick
with
her
and
so
will
I
And
if
thou
prate
of
mountains
let
them
throw
Millions
of
acres
on

Singeing

pate
against
the
burning
zone
Make
Ossa
like
a
wart
Nay
an
thoult
mouth
Ill
rant
as
well
as
thou
Queen
This
is
mere
madness
And
thus
a
while
the
fit
will
work
on
him
Anon
as
patient
as
the
female
dove
When
that
her
golden
couplets
are
disclosd
His
silence
will
sit
drooping
Ham
Hear
you
sir
What
is
the
reason
that
you
use
me
thus
I
lovd
you
ever
But
it
is
no
matter
Let
Hercules
himself
do
what
he
may
The
cat
will
mew
and
dog
will
have
his
day
King
I
pray
thee
good
Horatio
wait
upon
him
To
Laertes
Strengthen
your
patience
in
our
last
nights
speech
Well
put
the
matter
to
the
present
push
Good
Gertrude
set
some
watch
over
your
son
This
grave
shall
have
a
living
monument
An
hour
of
quiet
shortly
shall

see
Till
then
in
patience
our
proceeding
be
Scene
Elsinore
hall
in
the
Castle
Enter
Hamlet
and
Horatio
Ham
So
much
for
this
sir
now
shall
you
see
the
other
You
do
remember
all
the
circumstance
Hor
Remember
it
my
lord
Ham
Sir
in
my
heart
there
was
a
kind
of
fighting
That
would
not
let
me
sleep
Methought
I
lay
Worse
than
the
mutinies
in
the
bilboes
Rashly
And
praisd
be
rashness
for
it
let
us
know
Our
indiscretion
sometime
serves
us
well
When
our
deep
plots
do
pall
and
that
should
learn
us
Theres
a
divinity
that
shapes
our
ends
Roughhew
them
how
we
will
Hor
That
is
most
certain
Ham
Up
from
my
cabin
My
seagown
scarfd
about
me
in
the
dark
Gropd
I
to
find
out
them
had
my
desire
Fingerd
their
packet
and
in
fine
withdrew
To
mine
own
room
again
making
so
bold
My
fears
forgetting
manners
to
unseal
Their
grand
commission
where
I
found
Horatio
royal
knavery
an
exact
command
Larded
with
many
several
sorts
of
reasons
Importing
Denmarks
health
and
Englands
too
With
hoo
such
bugs
and
goblins
in
my
life
That
on
the
supervise
no
leisure
bated
No
not
to
stay
the
finding
of
the
axe
My
head
should
be
struck
off
Hor
Ist
possible
Ham
Heres
the
commission
read
it
at
more
leisure
But
wilt
thou
bear
me
how
I
did
proceed
Hor
I
beseech
you
Ham
Being
thus
benetted
round
with
villanies
Or
I
could
make
a
prologue
to
my
brains
They
had
begun
the
play
I
sat
me
down
Devisd
a
new
commission
wrote
it
fair
I
once
did
hold
it
as
our
statists
do
baseness
to
write
fair
and
labourd
much
How
to
forget
that
learning
but
sir
now
It
did
me
yeomans
service
Wilt
thou
know
Th
effect
of
what
I
wrote
Hor
Ay
good
my
lord
Ham
An
earnest
conjuration
from
the
King
As
England
was
his
faithful
tributary
As
love
between
them
like
the
palm
might
flourish
As
peace
should
still
her
wheaten
garland
wear
And
stand
a
comma
tween
their
amities
And
many
suchlike
ass
of
great
charge
That
on
the
view
and
knowing
of
these
contents
Without
debatement
further
more
or
less
He
should
the
bearers
put
to
sudden
death
Not
shriving
time
allowd
Hor
How
was
this
seald
Ham
Why
even
in
that
was
heaven
ordinant
I
had
my
fathers
signet
in
my
purse
which
was
the
model
of
that
Danish
seal
Folded
the
writ
up
in
the
form
of
th
other
Subscribd
it
gavet
th
impression
placd
it
safely
The
changeling
never
known
Now
the
next
day
Was
our
seafight
and
what
to
this
was
sequent
Thou
knowst
already
Hor
So
Guildenstern
and
Rosencrantz
go
tot
Ham
Why
man
they
did
make
love
to
this
employment
They
are
not
near
my
conscience
their
defeat
Does
by
their
own
insinuation
grow
Tis
dangerous
when
the
baser
nature
comes
Between
the
pass
and
fell
incensed
points
Of
mighty
opposites
Hor
Why
what
a
king
is
this
Ham
Does
it
not
thinkst
thee
stand
me
now
upon
He
that
hath
killd
my
king
and
whord
my
mother
Poppd
in
between
th
election
and
my
hopes
Thrown
out
his
angle
for
my
Proper
life
And
with
such
coznage
ist
not
perfect
conscience
To
quit
him
with
this
arm
And
ist
not
to
be
damnd
To
let
this
canker
of
our
nature
come
In
further
evil
Hor
It
must
be
shortly
known
to
him
from
England
What
is
the
issue
of
the
business
there
Ham
It
will
be
short
the
interim
is
mine
And
a
mans
life
is
no
more
than
to
say
one
But
I
am
very
sorry
good
Horatio
That
to
Laertes
I
forgot
myself
For
by
the
image
of
my
cause
I
see
The
portraiture
of
his
Ill
court
his
favours
But
sure
the
bravery
of
his
grief
did
put
me
Into
a
towring
passion
Hor
Peace
Who
comes
here
Enter
young
Osric
a
courtier
Osr
Your
lordship
is
right
welcome
back
to
Denmark
Ham
I
humbly
thank
you
sir
Aside
to
Horatio
Dost
know
this
waterfly
Hor
aside
to
Hamlet
No
my
good
lord
Ham
aside
to
Horatio
Thy
state
is
the
more
gracious
for
tis
a
vice
to
know
him
He
hath
much
land
and
fertile
Let
a
beast
be
lord
of
beasts
and
his
crib
shall
stand
at
the
kings
mess
Tis
a
chough
but
as
I
say
spacious
in
the
possession
of
dirt
Osr
Sweet
lord
if
your
lordship
were
at
leisure
I
should
impart
a
thing
to
you
from
his
Majesty
Ham
I
will
receive
it
sir
with
all
diligence
of
spirit
Put
your
bonnet
to
his
right
use
Tis
for
the
head
Osr
I
thank
your
lordship
it
is
very
hot
Ham
No
believe
me
tis
very
cold
the
wind
is
northerly
Osr
It
is
indifferent
cold
my
lord
indeed
Ham
But
yet
methinks
it
is
very
sultry
and
hot
for
my
complexion
Osr
Exceedingly
my
lord
it
is
very
sultry
as
twere
I
cannot
tell
how
But
my
lord
his
Majesty
bade
me
signify
to
you
that
he
has
laid
a
great
wager
on
your
head
Sir
this
is
the
matter
Ham
I
beseech
you
remember
Hamlet
moves
him
to
put
on
his
hat
Osr
Nay
good
my
lord
for
mine
ease
in
good
faith
Sir
here
is
newly
come
to
court
Laertes
believe
me
an
absolute
gentleman
full
of
most
excellent
differences
of
very
soft
society
and
great
showing
Indeed
to
speak
feelingly
of
him
he
is
the
card
or
calendar
of
gentry
for
you
shall
find
in
him
the
continent
of
what
part
a
gentleman
would
see
Ham
Sir
his
definement
suffers
no
perdition
in
you
though
I
know
to
divide
him
inventorially
would
dozy
th
arithmetic
of
memory
and
yet
but
yaw
neither
in
respect
of
his
quick
sail
But
in
the
verity
of
extolment
I
take
him
to
be
a
soul
of
great
article
and
his
infusion
of
such
dearth
and
rareness
as
to
make
true
diction
of
him
his
semblable
is
his
mirror
and
who
else
would
trace
him
his
umbrage
nothing
more
Osr
Your
lordship
speaks
most
infallibly
of
him
Ham
The
concernancy
sir
Why
do
we
wrap
the
gentleman
in
our
more
rawer
breath
Osr
Sir
Hor
aside
to
Hamlet
Ist
not
possible
to
understand
in
another
tongue
You
will
dot
sir
really
Ham
What
imports
the
nomination
of
this
gentleman
Osr
Of
Laertes
Hor
aside
His
purse
is
empty
already
Alls
golden
words
are
spent
Ham
Of
him
sir
Osr
I
know
you
are
not
ignorant
Ham
I
would
you
did
sir
yet
in
faith
if
you
did
it
would
not
much
approve
me
Well
sir
Osr
You
are
not
ignorant
of
what
excellence
Laertes
is
Ham
I
dare
not
confess
that
lest
I
should
compare
with
him
in
excellence
but
to
know
a
man
well
were
to
know
himself
Osr
I
mean
sir
for
his
weapon
but
in
the
imputation
laid
on
him
by
them
in
his
meed
hes
unfellowed
Ham
Whats
his
weapon
Osr
Rapier
and
dagger
Ham
Thats
two
of
his
weapons
but
well
Osr
The
King
sir
hath
wagerd
with
him
six
Barbary
horses
against
the
which
he
has
impond
as
I
take
it
six
French
rapiers
and
poniards
with
their
assigns
as
girdle
hangers
and
so
Three
of
the
carriages
in
faith
are
very
dear
to
fancy
very
responsive
to
the
hilts
most
delicate
carriages
and
of
very
liberal
conceit
Ham
What
call
you
the
carriages
Hor
aside
to
Hamlet
I
knew
you
must
be
edified
by
the
margent
ere
you
had
done
Osr
The
carriages
sir
are
the
hangers
Ham
The
phrase
would
be
more
germane
to
the
matter
if
we
could
carry
cannon
by
our
sides
I
would
it
might
be
hangers
till
then
But
on
Six
Barbary
horses
against
six
French
swords
their
assigns
and
three
liberalconceited
carriages
thats
the
French
bet
against
the
Danish
Why
is
this
all
impond
as
you
call
it
Osr
The
King
sir
hath
laid
that
in
a
dozen
passes
between
yourself
and
him
he
shall
not
exceed
you
three
hits
he
hath
laid
on
twelve
for
nine
and
it
would
come
to
immediate
trial
if
your
lordship
would
vouchsafe
the
answer
Ham
How
if
I
answer
no
Osr
I
mean
my
lord
the
opposition
of
your
person
in
trial
Ham
Sir
I
will
walk
here
in
the
hall
If
it
please
his
Majesty
it
is
the
breathing
time
of
day
with
me
Let
the
foils
be
brought
the
gentleman
willing
and
the
King
hold
his
purpose
I
will
win
for
him
if
I
can
if
not
I
will
gain
nothing
but
my
shame
and
the
odd
hits
Osr
Shall
I
redeliver
you
een
so
Ham
To
this
effect
sir
after
what
flourish
your
nature
will
Osr
I
commend
my
duty
to
your
lordship
Ham
Yours
yours
himself
there
are
no
tongues
else
fors
turn
Hor
This
lapwing
runs
away
with
the
shell
on
his
head
Ham
He
did
comply
with
his
dug
before
he
suckd
it
Thus
has
he
and
many
more
of
the
same
bevy
that
I
know
the
drossy
age
dotes
on
only
got
the
tune
of
the
time
and
outward
habit
of
encounter
a
kind
of
yesty
collection
which
carries
them
through
and
through
the
most
fannd
and
winnowed
opinions
and
do
but
blow
them
to
their
trialthe
bubbles
are
out
Enter
a
Lord
Lord
My
lord
his
Majesty
commended
him
to
you
by
young
Osric
who
brings
back
to
him
that
you
attend
him
in
the
hall
He
sends
to
know
if
your
pleasure
hold
to
play
with
Laertes
or
that
you
will
take
longer
time
Ham
I
am
constant
to
my
purposes
they
follow
the
Kings
pleasure
If
his
fitness
speaks
mine
is
ready
now
or
whensoever
provided
I
be
so
able
as
now
Lord
The
King
and
Queen
and
all
are
coming
down
Ham
In
happy
time
Lord
The
Queen
desires
you
to
use
some
gentle
entertainment
to
Laertes
before
you
fall
to
play
Ham
She
well
instructs
me
Hor
You
will
lose
this
wager
my
lord
Ham
I
do
not
think
so
Since
he
went
into
France
I
have
been
in
continual
practice
I
shall
win
at
the
odds
But
thou
wouldst
not
think
how
ill
alls
here
about
my
heart
But
it
is
no
matter
Hor
Nay
good
my
lord
Ham
It
is
but
foolery
but
it
is
such
a
kind
of
gaingiving
as
would
perhaps
trouble
a
woman
Hor
If
your
mind
dislike
anything
obey
it
I
will
forestall
their
repair
hither
and
say
you
are
not
fit
Ham
Not
a
whit
we
defy
augury
theres
a
special
providence
in
the
fall
of
a
sparrow
If
it
be
now
tis
not
to
come
if
it
be
not
to
come
it
will
be
now
if
it
be
not
now
yet
it
will
come
the
readiness
is
all
Since
no
man
knows
aught
of
what
he
leaves
what
ist
to
leave
betimes
Let
be
Enter
King
Queen

Attendants

King
Come
Hamlet
come
and
take
this
hand
from
me
The
King
puts
Laertes
hand
into
Hamlets
Ham
Give
me
your
pardon
sir
I
have
done
you
wrong
But
pardont
as
you
are
a
gentleman
This
presence
knows
And
you
must
needs
have
heard
how
I
am
punishd
With
sore
distraction
What
I
have
done
That
might
your
nature
honour
and
exception
Roughly
awake
I
here
proclaim
was
madness
Wast
Hamlet
wrongd
Laertes
Never
Hamlet
If
Hamlet
from
himself
be
taken
away
And
when
hes
not
himself
does
wrong
Laertes
Then
Hamlet
does
it
not
Hamlet
denies
it
Who
does
it
then
His
madness
Ift
be
so
Hamlet
is
of
the
faction
that
is
wrongd
His
madness
is
poor
Hamlets
enemy
Sir
in
this
audience
Let
my
disclaiming
from
a
purposd
evil
Free
me
so
far
in
your
most
generous
thoughts
That
I
have
shot
my
arrow
oer
the
house
And
hurt
my
brother
Laer
I
am
satisfied
in
nature
Whose
motive
in
this
case
should
stir
me
most
To
my
revenge
But
in
my
terms
of
honour
I
stand
aloof
and
will
no
reconcilement
Till
by
some
elder
masters
of
known
honour
I
have
a
voice
and
precedent
of
peace
To
keep
my
name
ungord
But
till
that
time
I
do
receive
your
offerd
love
like
love
And
will
not
wrong
it
Ham
I
embrace
it
freely
And
will
this
brothers
wager
frankly
play
Give
us
the
foils
Come
on
Laer
Come
one
for
me
Ham
Ill
be
your
foil
Laertes
In
mine
ignorance
Your
skill

Stick

The
King

Hamlets
better
breath
And

throw
Richer

In
Denmarks

worn
Give

The

Let

By

Things

If
thou
didst
ever
hold
me
in
thy
heart
Absent
thee
from
felicity
awhile
And
in
this
harsh
world
draw
thy
breath
in
pain
To
tell
my
story
March
afar
off

What
warlike
noise
is
this
Osr
Young
Fortinbras
with

To

This
warlike

The
potent
poison
quite
oercrows
my
spirit
I
cannot
live
to
hear
the
news
from
England
But
I
do
prophesy
th
election
lights
On
Fortinbras
He
has
my
dying
voice
So
tell
him
with
th
occurrents
more
and

Which
have
solicited
the
rest

Dies
Hor
Now
cracks
a
noble
heart
Good
night
sweet
prince
And
flights
of
angels
sing
thee
to
thy
rest
March

Why
does
the
drum
come
hither
Enter
Fortinbras
and
English
Ambassadors
with
Drum
Colours
and
Attendants
Fort
Where
is
this
sight
Hor
What
is
it
you
will
see
If
aught
of
woe
or
wonder
cease
your
search
Fort
This
quarry
cries
on

proud
Death
What
feast
is
toward
in
thine
eternal
cell
That
thou
so
many
princes
at
a
shot
So
bloodily
hast
struck
Ambassador
The
sight
is
dismal
And
our
affairs
from
England
come
too
late
The
ears
are
senseless
that
should
give
us
bearing
To
tell
him
his
commandment
is
fulfilld
That
Rosencrantz
and
Guildenstern
are
dead
Where
should
We
have
our
thanks
Hor
Not
from
his
mouth
Had
it
th
ability
of
life
to
thank
you
He
never
gave
commandment
for
their
death
But
since
so
jump
upon
this
bloody
question
You
from
the
Polack
wars
and
you
from
England
Are
here
arrivd
give
order
that
these
bodies
High
on
a
stage
be
placed
to
the
view
And
let
me
speak
to
the
yet
unknowing
world
How
these
things
came
about
So
shall
You
hear
Of
carnal
bloody
and
unnatural
acts
Of
accidental
judgments
casual
slaughters
Of
deaths
put
on
by
cunning
and
forcd
cause
And
in
this
upshot
purposes
mistook
Falln
on
th
inventors
heads
All
this
can
I
Truly
deliver
Fort
Let
us
haste
to
hear
it
And
call
the
noblest
to
the
audience
For
me
with
sorrow
I
embrace
my
fortune
I
have
some
rights
of
memory
in
this
kingdom
Which
now
to
claim
my
vantage
doth
invite
me
Hor
Of
that
I
shall
have
also
cause
to
speak
And
from
his
mouth
whose
voice
will
draw
on
more
But
let
this
same
be
presently
performd
Even
while
mens
minds
are
wild
lest
more
mischance
On
plots
and
errors
happen
Fort
Let
four
captains
Bear
Hamlet
like
a
soldier
to
the
stage
For
he
was
likely
had
he
been
put
on
To
have
provd
most
royally
and
for
his
passage
The
soldiers
music
and
the
rites
of
war
Speak
loudly
for
him
Take
up
the
bodies
Such
a
sight
as
this
Becomes
the
field
but
here
shows
much
amiss
Go

Earl

Sir
Walter
Blunt
with

So
shaken
as
we
are
so
wan
with

Find
we
a
time
for
frighted
peace
to
pant
And
breathe
shortwinded
accents
of
new
broils
To
be
commencd
in
stronds
afar

No

the
thirsty
entrance
of

Shall

No

channel

Nor
Bruise

Of

Those

Which

All
of

nature
of
one
substance
bred
Did
lately
meet

intestine
shock
And

close
of

butchery
Shall

March

Against

As

Whose
soldier
now
under
whose
blessed
cross
We
are
impressed
and
engagd
to
fight
Forthwith

power
of
English
shall

levy
Whose
arms
were
moulded
in

womb
To

Over

Which

For

advantage
on

bitter
cross
But
this
our
purpose
now
is
twelvemonth
old
And
bootless
tis
to
tell
you
we
will
go
Therefore
we
meet
not
now
Then
let
me
hear
Of
you
my
gentle
cousin
Westmoreland
What
yesternight
our
Council
did
decree
In
forwarding
this
dear
expedience
West
My
liege
this
haste
was
hot
in
question
And
many
limits
of
the
charge
set
down
But
yesternight
when
all
athwart
there
came
post
from
Wales
loaden
with
heavy
news
Whose
worst
was
that
the
noble
Mortimer
Leading
the
men
of
Herefordshire
to
fight
Against
the
irregular
and
wild
Glendower
Was
by
the
rude
hands
of
that
Welshman
taken
thousand
of
his
people
butchered
Upon
whose
dead
corpse
there
was
such
misuse
Such
beastly
shameless
transformation
By
those
Welshwomen
done
as
may
not
be
Without
much
shame
retold
or
spoken
of
King
It
seems
then
that
the
tidings
of
this
broil
Brake
off
our
business
for
the
Holy
Land
West
This
matchd
with
other

my
gracious
lord
For

uneven

Came

On

Day
the
gallant
Hotspur
there
Young
Harry
Percy
and
brave
Archibald
That
evervaliant
and
approved
Scot
At
Holmedon
met
Where
they
did
spend
a
sad
and
bloody
hour
As
by
discharge
of
their
artillery
And
shape
of
likelihood
the
news
was
told
For
he
that
brought
them
in
the
very
heat
And
pride
of
their
contention
did
take
horse
Uncertain
of
the
issue
any
way
King
Here

Sir
Walter

lighted
from
his
horse
Staind
with
the
variation
of
each
soil
Betwixt
that
Holmedon
and
this
seat
of
ours
And
he
hath
brought
us
smooth
and
welcome
news
The
Earl
of
Douglas
is
discomfited
Ten
thousand
bold
Scots
twoandtwenty

Balkd
in

In

It
is
a
conquest
for

boast
of

Yea
there
thou
makst

makst

In

Who

Whilst
I
by
looking
on
the
praise
of
him
See
riot
and
dishonour
stain
the
brow
Of
my
young
Harry
that
it
could
be
provd
That
some
nighttripping
fairy
had
exchangd
In
cradle
clothes
our
children
where
they
lay
And
calld
mine
Percy
his
Plantagenet
Then
would
I
have
his
Harry
and
he
mine
But
let
him
from
my
thoughts
What
think
you
coz
Of
this
young
Percys
pride
The
prisoners
Which
he
in
this
adventure
hath
surprisd
To
his
own
use
he
keeps
and
sends
me
word
I
shall
have
none
but
Mordake
Earl
of
Fife
West
This
is
his
uncles
teaching
this
Worcester
Malevolent
to
you
In
all
aspects
Which
makes
him
prune
himself
and
bristle
up
The
crest
of
youth
against
your
dignity
King
But
I
have
sent
for
him
to
answer
this
And
for
this
cause
awhile
we
must
neglect
Our
holy
purpose
to
Jerusalem
Cousin
on
Wednesday
next
our
council
we
Will
hold
at
Windsor
So
inform
the
lords
But
come
yourself
with
speed

For

Now

lad
Prince
Thou
art
so
fatwitted
with
drinking
of
old
sack

unbuttoning
thee
after
supper
and
sleeping
upon
benches
after
noon
that
thou
hast
forgotten
to
demand
that
truly
which
thou
wouldest
truly
know
What
a
devil
hast

Indeed

For

Yea

Thou
hast
the
most

vanity
I
would

An

rated

about
you

I
markd
him
not

leave
the
Prince

lay
him
down
such
reasons
for
this
adventure

he
shall
go
Fal
Well
God
give
thee
the
spirit
of
persuasion
and
him
the
ears
of
profiting
that
what
thou
speakest
may
move
and
what

hears
may

Poins
Now
my
good
sweet
honey
lord
ride
with
us
tomorrow
I
have
a
jest
to
execute
that
I
cannot
manage
alone
Falstaff
Bardolph
Peto
and
Gadshill
shall
rob
those
men
that
we
have
already
waylaid
yourself
and
I
will
not
be
there
and
when
they
have
the
booty
if
you
and
I
do
not
rob
them
cut
this
head
off
from
my
shoulders
Prince
How
shall
we
part
with
them
in
setting
forth
Poins
Why
we
will
set
forth
before
or
after
them
and
appoint
them
a
place
of
meeting
wherein
it
is
at
our
pleasure
to
fail
and
then
will
they
adventure
upon
the
exploit
themselves
which
they
shall
have
no
sooner
achieved
but
well
set
upon
them
Prince
Yea
but
tis
like
that
they
will
know
us
by
our
horses
by
our
habits
and
by
every
other
appointment
to
be
ourselves
Poins
Tut
our
horses
they
shall
not
see
Ill
tie
them
in
the
wood
our
wizards
we
will
change
after
we
leave
them
and
sirrah
I
have
cases
of
buckram
for
the
nonce
to
immask
our
noted
outward
garments
Prince
Yea
but
I
doubt
they
will
be
too
hard
for
us
Poins
Well
for
two
of
them
I
know
them
to
be
as
truebred
cowards
as
ever
turnd
back
and
for
the
third
if
he
fight
longer
than
he
sees
reason
Ill
forswear
arms
The
virtue
of
this
jest
will
lie
the
incomprehensible
lies
that
this
same
fat
rogue
will
tell
us
when
we
meet
at
supper
how
thirty
at
least
he
fought
with
what
wards
what
blows
what
extremities
he
endured
and
in
the
reproof
of
this
lies
the
jest
Prince
Well
Ill
go
with
thee
Provide
us
all
things
necessary
and
meet
me
tonight
in
Eastcheap
There
Ill
sup
Farewell
Poins
Farewell
my
lord
Prince
I
know
you
all
and
will
awhile
uphold
The
unyokd
humour
of
your
idleness
Yet
herein
will
I
imitate
the
sun
Who
doth
permit
the
base
contagious
clouds
To
smother
up
his
beauty
from
the
world
That
when
he
please
again
to
lie
himself
Being
wanted
he
may
be
more
wondred
at
By
breaking
through
the
foul
and
ugly
mists
Of
vapours
that
did
seem
to
strangle
him
If
all
the
year
were
playing
holidays
To
sport
would
be
as
tedious
as
to
work
But
when
they
seldom
come
they
wishdfor
come
And
nothing
pleaseth
but
rare
accidents
So
when
this
loose
behaviour
I
throw
off
And
pay
the
debt
I
never
promised
By
how
much
better
than
my
word
I
am
By
so
much
shall
I
falsify
mens
hopes
And
like
bright
metal
on
a
sullen
ground
My
reformation
glittring
oer
my
fault
Shall
show
more
goodly
and
attract
more
eyes
Than
that
which
hath
no
foil
to
set
it
off
Ill
so
offend
to
make
offence

You
tread

be

I

Those

Is
guilty

Hot
My

I
did
deny
no
prisoners
But
I
remember
when
the
fight
was
done
When
I
was
dry
with
rage
and
extreme
toll
Breathless
and
faint
leaning
upon
my
sword
Came
there
a
certain
lord
neat
and
trimly
dressd
Fresh
as
a
bridegroom
and
his
chin
new
reapd
Showd
like
a
stubble
land
at
harvest
home
He
was
perfumed
like
a
milliner
And
twixt
his
finger
and
his
thumb
he
held
pouncet
box
which
ever
and
anon
He
gave
his
nose
and
tookt
away
again
Who
therewith
angry
when
it
next
came
there
Took
it
in
snuff
and
still
he
smild
and
talkd
And
as
the
soldiers
bore
dead
bodies
by
He
calld
them
untaught
knaves
unmannerly
To
bring
a
slovenly
unhandsome
corse
Betwixt
the
wind
and
his
nobility
With
many
holiday
and
lady
terms
He
questioned
me
amongst
the
rest
demanded
My
prisoners
in
your
Majestys
behalf
I
then
all
smarting
with
my
wounds
being
cold
To
be
so
pestred
with
a
popingay
Out
of
my
grief
and
my
impatience
Answerd
neglectingly
I
know
not
what
He
should
or
he
should
not
for
he
made
me
mad
To
see
him
shine
so
brisk
and
smell
so
sweet
And
talk
so
like
a
waiting
gentlewoman
Of
guns
and
drums
and
wounds
God
save
the
mark
And
telling
me
the
sovereignest
thing
on
earth
Was
parmacity
for
an
inward
bruise
And
that
it
was
great
pity
so
it
was
This
villanous
saltpetre
should
be
diggd
Out
of
the
bowels
of
the
harmless
earth
Which
many
a
good
tall
fellow
had
destroyd
So
cowardly
and
but
for
these
vile
guns
He
would
himself
have
been
a
soldier
This
bald
unjointed
chat
of
his
my
lord
I
answered
indirectly
as
I
said
And
I
beseech
you
let
not
his
report
Come
current
for
an
accusation
Betwixt
my
love
and
your
high
majesty
Blunt
The
circumstance
considered
good
my
lord
Whateer
Lord
Harry
Percy
then
had
said
To
such
a
person
and
in
such
a
place
At
such
a
time
with
all
the
rest
retold
May
reasonably
die
and
never
rise
To
do
him
wrong
or
any
way
impeach
What
then
he
said
so
he
unsay
it
now
King
Why
yet
he
doth
deny
his
prisoners
But
with
proviso
and
exception
That
we
at
our
own
charge
shall
ransom
straight
His
brotherinlaw
the
foolish
Mortimer
Who
on
my
soul
hath
wilfully
betrayd
The
lives
of
those
that
he
did
lead
to
fight
Against
that
great
magician
damnd
Glendower
Whose
daughter
as
we
hear
the
Earl
of
March
Hath
lately
married
Shall
our
coffers
then
Be
emptied
to
redeem
a
traitor
home
Shall
we
buy
treason
and
indent
with
fears
When
they
have
lost
and
forfeited
themselves
No
on
the
barren
mountains
let
him
starve
For
I
shall
never
hold
that
man
my
friend
Whose
tongue
shall
ask
me
for
one
penny
cost
To
ransom
home
revolted
Mortimer
Hot
Revolted
Mortimer
He
never
did
fall
off
my
sovereign
liege
But
by
the
chance
of
war
To
prove
that
true
Needs
no
more
but
one
tongue
for
all
those
wounds
Those
mouthed
wounds
which
valiantly
he
took
When
on
the
gentle
Severns
sedgy
bank
In
single
opposition
hand
to
hand
He
did
confound
the
best
part
of
an
hour
In
changing
hardiment
with
great
Glendower
Three
times
they
breathd
and
three
times
did
they
drink
Upon
agreement
of
swift
Severns
flood
Who
then
affrighted
with
their
bloody
looks
Ran
fearfully
among
the
trembling
reeds
And
hid
his
crisp
head
in
the
hollow
bank
Bloodstained
with
these
valiant
cohabitants
Never
did
base
and
rotten
policy
Colour
her
working
with
such
deadly
wounds
Nor
never
could
the
noble
Mortimer
Receive
so
many
and
all
willingly
Then
let
not
him
be
slandered
with
revolt
King
Thou
dost
belie
him
Percy
thou
dost
belie
him
He
never
did
encounter
with
Glendower
I
tell
thee
He
durst
as
well
have
met
the
devil
alone
As
Owen
Glendower
for
an
enemy
Art
thou
not
ashamd
But
sirrah
henceforth
Let
me
not
hear
you
speak
of
Mortimer
Send
me
your
prisoners
with
the
speediest
means
Or
you
shall
hear
in
such
a
kind
from
me
As
will
displease
you
My
Lord
Northumberland
We
license
your
departure
with
your
son
Send
us
your
prisoners
or
you
will
hear
of
it
Hot
An
if
the
devil
come
and
roar
for
them
I
will
not
send
them
I
will
after
straight
And
tell
him
so
for
I
will
else
my
heart
Albeit
I
make
a
hazard
of
my
head
North
What
drunk
with
choler
Stay
and
pause
awhile
Here
comes
your
uncle
Enter
Worcester
Hot
Speak
of
Mortimer
Zounds
I
will
speak
of
him
and
let
my
soul
Want
mercy
if
I
do
not
join
with
him
Yea
on
his
part
Ill
empty
all
these
veins
And
shed
my
dear
blood
drop
by
drop
in
the
dust
But
I
will
lift
the
downtrod
Mortimer
As
high
in
the
air
as
this
unthankful
king
As
this
ingrate
and
cankred
Bolingbroke
North
Brother
the
King
hath
made
your
nephew
mad
Wor
Who
struck
this
heat
up
after
I
was
gone
Hot
He
will
forsooth
have
all
my
prisoners
And
when
I
urgd
the
ransom
once
again
Of
my
wives
brother
then
his
cheek
lookd
pale
And
on
my
face
he
turnd
an
eye
of
death
Trembling
even
at
the
name
of
Mortimer
Wor
I
cannot
blame
him
Was
not
he
proclaimd
By
Richard
that
dead
is
the
next
of
blood
North
He
was
I
heard
the
proclamation
And
then
it
was
when
the
unhappy
King
Whose
wrongs
in
us
God
pardon
did
set
forth
Upon
his
Irish
expedition
From
whence
he
intercepted
did
return
To
be
deposd
and
shortly
murdered
Wor
And
for
whose
death
we
in
the
worlds
wide
mouth
Live
scandalizd
and
foully
spoken
of
Hot
But
soft
I
pray
you
Did
King
Richard
then
Proclaim
my
brother
Edmund
Mortimer
Heir
to
the
crown
North
He
did
myself
did
hear
it
Hot
Nay
then
I
cannot
blame
his
cousin
king
That
wishd
him
on
the
barren
mountains
starve
But
shall
it
be
that
you
that
set
the
crown
Upon
the
head
of
this
forgetful
man
And
for
his
sake
wear
the
detested
blot
Of
murtherous
subornation
shall
it
be
That
you
a
world
of
curses
undergo
Being
the
agents
or
base
second
means
The
cords
the
ladder
or
the
hangman
rather
pardon
me
that
I
descend
so
low
To
show
the
line
and
the
predicament
Wherein
you
range
under
this
subtile
king
Shall
it
for
shame
be
spoken
in
these
days
Or
fill
up
chronicles
in
time
to
come
That
men
of
your
nobility
and
power
Did
gage
them
both
in
an
unjust
behalf
As
both
of
you
God
pardon
it
have
done
To
put
down
Richard
that
sweet
lovely
rose
And
plant
this
thorn
this
canker
Bolingbroke
And
shall
it
in
more
shame
be
further
spoken
That
you
are
foold
discarded
and
shook
off
By
him
for
whom
these
shames
ye
underwent
No
yet
time
serves
wherein
you
may
redeem
Your
banishd
honours
and
restore
yourselves
Into
the
good
thoughts
of
the
world
again
Revenge
the
jeering
and
disdaind
contempt
Of
this
proud
king
who
studies
day
and
night
To
answer
all
the
debt
he
owes
to
you
Even
with
the
bloody
payment
of
your
deaths
Therefore
I
say
Wor
Peace
cousin
say
no
more
And
now
I
will
unclasp
a
secret
book
And
to
your
quickconceiving
discontents
Ill
read
you
matter
deep
and
dangerous
As
full
of
peril
and
adventurous
spirit
As
to
oerwalk
a
current
roaring
loud
On
the
unsteadfast
footing
of
a
spear
Hot
If
he
fall
in
good
night
or
sink
or
swim
Send
danger
from
the
east
unto
the
west
So
honour
cross
it
from
the
north
to
south
And
let
them
grapple
the
blood
more
stirs
To
rouse
a
lion
than
to
start
a
hare
North
Imagination
of
some
great
exploit
Drives
him
beyond
the
bounds
of
patience
Hot
By
heaven
methinks
it
were
an
easy
leap
To
pluck
bright
honour
from
the
palefacd
moon
Or
dive
into
the
bottom
of
the
deep
Where
fadom
line
could
never
touch
the
ground
And
pluck
up
drowned
honour
by
the
locks
So
he
that
doth
redeem
her
thence
might
wear
Without
corrival
all
her
dignities
But
out
upon
this
halffacd
fellowship
Wor
He
apprehends
a
world
of
figures
here
But
not
the
form
of
what
he
should
attend
Good

me
audience
for
a
while
Hot
I
cry
you
mercy
Wor
Those

noble
Scots
That

your
prisoners

keep
them
all
By
God

No

And

Forbade

Nothing

Hear

Save

Farewell

Tying

Why

Nettled

At

You

Why

Deliver

Thy

For

Harry
I
do
not
only
marvel
where
thou
spendest
thy
time
but
also
how
thou
art
accompanied
For
though
the
camomile
the
more
it
is
trodden
on
the
faster
it
grows
yet
youth
the
more
it
is
wasted
the
sooner
it
wears
That
thou
art
my
son
I
have
partly
thy
mothers
word
partly
my
own
opinion
but
chiefly
a
villanous
trick
of
thine
eye
and
a
foolish
hanging
of
thy
nether
lip
that
doth
warrant
me
If
then
thou
be
son
to
me
here
lies
the
point
why
being
son
to
me
art
thou
so
pointed
at
Shall
the
blessed
sun
of
heaven
prove
a
micher
and
eat
blackberries
question
not
to
be
askd
Shall
the
son
of
England
prove
a
thief
and
take
purses
question
to
be
askd
There
is
a
thing
Harry
which
thou
hast
often
heard
of
and
it
is
known
to
many
in
our
land
by
the
name
of
pitch
This
pitch
as
ancient
writers
do
report
doth
defile
so
doth
the
company
thou
keepest
For
Harry
now
I
do
not
speak
to
thee
in
drink
but
in
tears
not
in
pleasure
but
in
passion
not
in
words
only
but
in
woes
also
and
yet
there
is
a
virtuous
man
whom
I
have
often
noted
in
thy
company
but
I
know
not
his
name
Prince
What
manner
of
man
an
it
like
your
Majesty
Fal
goodly
portly
man
i
faith
and
a
corpulent
of
a
cheerful
look
a
pleasing
eye
and
a
most
noble
carriage
and
as
I
think
his
age
some
fifty
or
byr
Lady
inclining
to
threescore
and
now
I
remember
me
his
name
is
Falstaff
If
that
man
should
be
lewdly
given
he
deceiveth
me
for
Harry
I
see
virtue
in
his
looks
If
then
the
tree
may
be
known
by
the
fruit
as
the
fruit
by
the
tree
then
peremptorily
I
speak
it
there
is
virtue
in
that
Falstaff
Him
keep
with
the
rest
banish
And
tell
me
now
thou
naughty
varlet
tell
me
where
hast
thou
been

Dost

Do

Depose

Swearest

Henceforth

Thou

violently

There

a

old

Why
dost

that
trunk

Wherein

But
to

I

more
harm
in

were
to
say
more
than
I
know
That
he
is
old
the
more
the
pity
his
white
hairs
do
witness
it
but
that
he
is
saving
your
reverence
a
whoremaster
that
I
utterly
deny
If
sack
and
sugar
be
a
fault
God
help
the
wicked
If
to

be
a
sin

Will

No

Sit

Hotspur
For

as
oft

Doth

of
you
his
cheek
looks
pale
and
with
rising
sigh
he
wisheth
you
in
heaven
Hot
And
you
in
hell
as
oft
as
he
hears
Owen
Glendower
spoke
of
Glend
I
cannot
blame
him
At
my
nativity
The
front
of
heaven
was
full
of
fiery
shapes
Of
burning
cressets
and
at
my
birth
The
frame
and
huge
foundation
of
the
earth
Shakd
like
a
coward
Hot
Why
so
it
would
have
done
at
the
same
season
if
your
mothers
cat
had
but
kittend
though
yourself
had
never
been
born
Glend
I
say
the
earth
did
shake
when
I
was
born
Hot
And
I
say
the
earth
was
not
of
my
mind
If
you
suppose
as
fearing
you
it
shook
Glend
The
heavens
were
all
on
fire
the
earth
did
tremble
Hot
then
the
earth
shook
to
see
the
heavens
on
fire
And
not
in
fear
of
your
nativity
Diseased
nature
oftentimes
breaks
forth
In
strange
eruptions
oft
the
teeming
earth
Is
with
a
kind
of
colic
pinchd
and
vexd
By
the
imprisoning
of
unruly
wind
Within
her
womb
which
for
enlargement
striving
Shakes
the
old
beldame
earth
and
topples
down
Steeples
and
mossgrown
towers
At
your
birth
Our
grandam
earth
having
this
distemprature
In
passion
shook
Glend
Cousin
of
many
men
I
do
not
bear
these
crossings
Give
me
leave
To
tell
you
once
again
that
at
my
birth
The
front
of
heaven
was
full
of
fiery
shapes
The
goats
ran
from
the
mountains
and
the
herds
Were
strangely
clamorous
to
the
frighted
fields
These
signs
have
markd
me
extraordinary
And
all
the
courses
of
my
life
do
show
I
am
not
in
the
roll
of
common
men
Where
is
he
living
clippd
in
with
the
sea
That
chides
the
banks
of
England
Scotland
Wales
Which
calls
me
pupil
or
hath
read
to
me
And
bring
him
out
that
is
but
womans
son
Can
trace
me
in
the
tedious
ways
of
art
And
hold
me
pace
in
deep
experiments
Hot

think
theres
no
man
speaks
better
Welsh

Why

can
any

But

you
do

Why

can
teach
you

to
command
the
devil
Hot
And
I
can
teach
thee

to
shame
the
devil
By
telling
truth
Tell

shame

If
thou
have
power
to
raise
him
bring
him
hither
And
Ill
be
sworn
I
have
power
to
shame
him
hence
while
you
live
tell
truth

shame

devil

Come

Tomorrow

And
my
good
Lord

Worcester
will
set
forth
To
meet
your
father
and
the
Scottish
bower
As
is
appointed

at
Shrewsbury
My
father
Glendower
is
not
ready
yet
Nor
shall
we
need
his
help
these
fourteen
days
To
Glend
Within
that
space
you
may
have
drawn
together
Your
tenants
friends
and
neighbouring
gentlemen
Glend
shorter
time
shall
send
me
to
you
lords
And
in
my
conduct
shall
your
ladies
come
From
whom
you
now
must
steal
and
take
no
leave
For
there
will
be
a
world
of
water
shed
Upon
the
parting
of
your
wives
and
you
Hot
Methinks
my
moiety
north
from
Burton
here
In
quantity
equals
not
one
of
yours
See
how
this
river
comes
me
cranking
in
And
cuts
me
from
the
best
of
all
my
land
huge
halfmoon
a
monstrous
cantle
out
Ill
have
the
current
ill
this
place
dammd
up
And
here
the
smug
and
sliver
Trent
shall
run
In
a
new
channel
fair
and
evenly
It
shall
not
wind
with
such
a
deep
indent
To
rob
me
of
so
rich
a
bottom
here
Glend
Not
wind
It
shall
it
must
You
see
it
doth
Mort
Yea
but
Mark
how
he
bears
his
course
and
runs
me
up
With
like
advantage
on
the
other
side
Gelding
the
opposed
continent
as
much
As
on
the
other
side
it
takes
from
you
Wor
Yea
but
a
little
charge
will
trench
him
here
And
on
this
north
side
win
this
cape
of
land
And
then
he
runs
straight
and
even
Hot
Ill
have
it
so
little
charge
will
do
it
Glend
I
will
not
have
it
altred
Hot
Will
not
you
Glend
No
nor
you
shall
not
Hot
Who
shall
say
me
nay
Glend
No
that
will
I
Hot
Let
me
not
understand
you
then
speak
it
in
Welsh
Glend
I
can
speak
English
lord
as
well
as
you
For
I
was
traind
up
in
the
English
court
Where
being
but
young
I
framed
to
the
harp
Many
an
English
ditty
lovely
well
And
gave
the
tongue
a
helpful
ornament
virtue
that
was
never
seen
in
you
Hot
Marry
And
I
am
glad
of
it
with
all
my
heart
I
had
rather
be
a
kitten
and
cry
mew
Than
one
of
these
same
metre
balletmongers
I
had
rather
hear
a
brazen
canstick
turnd
Or
a
dry
wheel
grate
on
the
axletree
And
that
would
set
my
teeth
nothing
on
edge
Nothing
so
much
as
mincing
poetry
Tis
like
the
forcd
gait
of
a
shuffling
nag
Glend
Come
you
shall
have
Trent
turnd
Hot
I
do
not
care
Ill
give
thrice
so
much
land
To
any
welldeserving
friend
But
in
the
way
of
bargain
mark
ye
me
Ill
cavil
on
the
ninth
part
of
a
hair
Are
the
indentures
drawn
Shall
we
be
gone
Glend
The
moon
shines
fair
you
may
away
by
night
Ill
haste
the
writer
and
withal
Break
with
your
wives
of
your
departure
hence
I
am
afraid
my
daughter
will
run
mad
So
much
she
doteth
on
her
Mortimer
Mort
Fie
cousin
Percy
how
you
cross
my
father
Hot
I
cannot
choose
Sometimes
he
angers
me
With
telling
me
of
the
moldwarp
and
the
ant
Of
the
dreamer
Merlin
and
his
prophecies
And
of
a
dragon
and
a
finless
fish
clipwingd
griffin
and
a
moulten
raven
couching
lion
and
a
ramping
cat
And
such
a
deal
of
skimbleskamble
stuff
As
puts
me
from
my
faith
I
tell
you
what
He
held
me
last
night
at
least
nine
hours
In
reckoning
up
the
several
devils
names
That
were
his
lackeys
I
cried
hum
and
Well
go
to
But
markd
him
not
a
word
he
is
as
tedious
As
a
tired
horse
a
railing
wife
Worse
than
a
smoky
house
I
had
rather
live
With
cheese
and
garlic
in
a
windmill
far
Than
feed
on
cates
and
have
him
talk
to
me
In
any
summer
house
in
Christendom
Mort
In
faith
he
is
a
worthy
gentleman
Exceedingly
well
read
and
profited
In
strange
concealments
valiant
as
a
lion
And
wondrous
affable
and
as
bountiful
As
mines
of
India
Shall
I
tell
you
cousin
He
holds
your
temper
in
a
high
respect
And
curbs
himself
even
of
his
natural
scope
When
you
come
cross
his
humour
Faith
he
does
I
warrant
you
that
man
is
not
alive
Might
so
have
tempted
him
as
you
have
done
Without
the
taste
of
danger
and
reproof
But
do
not
use
it
oft
let
me
entreat
you
Wor
In
faith
my
lord
you
are
too
wilfulblame
And
since
your
coming
hither
have
done
enough
To
put
him
quite
besides
his
patience
You
must
needs
learn
lord
to
amend
this
fault
Though
sometimes
it
show
greatness
courage
blood
And
thats
the
dearest
grace
it
renders
you
Yet
oftentimes
it
doth
present
harsh
rage
Defect
of
manners
want
of
government
Pride
haughtiness
opinion
and
disdain
The
least
of
which
haunting
a
nobleman
Loseth
mens
hearts
and
leaves
behind
a
stain
Upon
the
beauty
of
all
parts
besides
Beguiling
them
of
commendation
Hot
Well
I
am
schoold
Good
manners
be
your
speed
Here
come
our
wives
and
let
us
take
our
leave
Enter
Glendower
with
the
Ladies
Mort
This
is
the
deadly
spite
that
angers
me
My
wife
can
speak
no
English
I
no
Welsh
Glend
My
daughter
weeps
she
will
not
part
with
you
Shell

shell

Mort
Good
father
tell
her
that
she
and
my
aunt
Percy
Shall
follow
in
your
conduct
speedily
Glendower
speaks
to
her
in
Welsh
and
she
answers
him
in
the
same
Glend
She
is
desperate
here
peevish
selfwilld
harlotry
One
that
no
persuasion
can
do
good
upon
The
Lady
speaks
in
Welsh
Mort
I
understand
thy
looks
That
pretty
Welsh
Which
thou
pourest
down
from
these
swelling
heavens
I
am
too
perfect
in
and
but
for
shame
In
such
a
Barley
should
I
answer
thee
The
Lady
again
in
Welsh
I
understand
thy
kisses
and
thou
mine
And
thats
a
feeling
disputation
But
I
will
never
be
a
truant
love
Till
I
have
learnt
thy
language
for
thy
tongue
Makes
Welsh
as
sweet
as
ditties
highly
pennd
Sung
by
a
fair
queen
in
a
summers
bowr
With
ravishing
division
to
her
lute
Glend
Nay
if
you
melt
then
will
she
run
mad
The
Lady
speaks
again
in
Welsh
Mort
I
am
ignorance
itself
in
this
Glend
She
bids
you
on
the
wanton
rushes
lay
you
down
And
rest
your
gentle
head
upon
her
lap
And
she
will
sing
the
song
that
pleaseth
you
And
on
your
eyelids
crown
the
god
of
sleep
Charming
your
blood
with
pleasing
heaviness
Making
such
difference
twixt
wake
and
sleep
As
is
the
difference
betwixt
day
and
night
The
hour
before
the
heavenlyharnessd
team
Begins
his
golden
progress
in
the
East
Mort
With
all
my
heart
Ill
sit
and

By

Lie

Scene
London
The
Palace
Enter
the
King
Prince
of
Wales
and
others
King
Lords
give
us
leave
The
Prince
of
Wales
and
I
Must
have
some
private
conference
but
be
near
at
hand
For
we
shall
presently
have
need
of
you
I
know
not
whether
God
will
have
it
so
For
some
displeasing
service
I
have
done
That
in
his
secret
doom
out
of
my
blood
Hell
breed
revengement
and
a
scourge
for
me
But
thou
dost
in
thy
passages
of
life
Make
me
believe
that
thou
art
only
markd
For
the
hot
vengeance
and
the
rod
of
heaven
To
punish
my
mistreadings
Tell
me
else
Could
such
inordinate
and
low
desires
Such
poor
such
bare
such
lewd
such
mean
attempts
Such
barren
pleasures
rude
society
As
thou
art
matchd
withal
and
grafted
to
Accompany
the
greatness
of
thy
blood
And
hold
their
level
with
thy
princely
heart
Prince
So
please
your
Majesty
I
would
I
could
Quit
all
offences
with
as
clear
excuse
As
well
as
I
am
doubtless
I
can
purge
Myself
of
many
I
am
charged
withal
Yet
such
extenuation
let
me
beg
As
in
reproof
of
many
tales
devisd
Which
oft
the
ear
of
greatness
needs
must
bear
By
smiling
pickthanks
and
base
newsmongers
I
may
for
some
things
true
wherein
my
youth
Hath
faulty
wandred
and
irregular
And
pardon
on
lily
true
submission
King
God
pardon
thee
Yet
let
me
wonder
Harry
At
thy
affections
which
do
hold
a
wing
Quite
from
the
flight
of
all
thy
ancestors
Thy
place
in
Council
thou
hast
rudely
lost
Which
by
thy
younger
brother
is
supplied
And
art
almost
an
alien
to
the
hearts
Of
all
the
court
and
princes
of
my
blood
The
hope
and
expectation
of
thy
time
Is
ruind
and
the
soul
of
every
man
Prophetically
do
forethink
thy
fall
Had
I
so
lavish
of
my
presence
been
So
commonhackneyd
in
the
eyes
of
men
So
stale
and
cheap
to
vulgar
company
Opinion
that
did
help
me
to
the
crown
Had
still
kept
loyal
to
possession
And
left
me
in
reputeless
banishment
fellow
of
no
mark
nor
likelihood
By
being
seldom
seen
I
could
not
stir
But
like
a
comet
I
Was
wondred
at
That
men
would
tell
their
children
This
is
he
Others
would
say
Where
Which
is
Bolingbroke
And
then
I
stole
all
courtesy
from
heaven
And
dressd
myself
in
such
humility
That
I
did
pluck
allegiance
from
mens
hearts
Loud
shouts
and
salutations
from
their
mouths
Even
in
the
presence
of
the
crowned
King
Thus
did
I
keep
my
person
fresh
and
new
My
presence
like
a
robe
pontifical
Neer
seen
but
wondred
at
and
so
my
state
Seldom
but
sumptuous
showd
like
a
feast
And
won
by
rareness
such
solemnity
The
skipping
King
he
ambled
up
and
down
With
shallow
jesters
and
rash
bavin
wits
Soon
kindled
and
soon
burnt
carded
his
state
Mingled
his
royalty
with
capring
fools
Had
his
great
name
profaned
with
their
scorns
And
gave
his
countenance
against
his
name
To
laugh
at
gibing
boys
and
stand
the
push
Of
every
beardless
vain
comparative
Grew
a
companion
to
the
common
streets
Enfeoffd
himself
to
popularity
That
being
dally
swallowed
by
mens
eyes
They
surfeited
with
honey
and
began
To
loathe
the
taste
of
sweetness
whereof
a
little
More
than
a
little
is
by
much
too
much
So
when
he
had
occasion
to
be
seen
He
was
but
as
the
cuckoo
is
in
June
Heard
not
regarded
seen
but
with
such
eyes
As
sick
and
blunted
with
community
Afford
no
extraordinary
gaze
Such
as
is
bent
on
unlike
majesty
When
it
shines
seldom
in
admiring
eyes
But
rather
drowsd
and
hung
their
eyelids
down
Slept
in
his
face
and
rendred
such
aspect
As
cloudy
men
use
to
their
adversaries
Being
with
his
presence
glutted
gorgd
and
full
And
in
that
very
line
Harry
standest
thou
For
thou
hast
lost
thy
princely
privilege
With
vile
participation
Not
an
eye
But
is
aweary
of
thy
common
sight
Save
mine
which
hath
desird
to
see
thee
more
Which
now
doth
that
I
would
not
have
it
do
Make
blind
itself
with
foolish
tenderness
Prince
I
shall
hereafter
my
thricegracious
lord
Be
more
myself
King
For
all
the
world
As
thou
art
to
this
hour
was
Richard
then
When
I
from
France
set
foot
at
Ravenspurgh
And
even
as
I
was
then
is
Percy
now
Now
by
my
sceptre
and
my
soul
to
boot
He
hath
more
worthy
interest
to
the
state
Than
thou
the
shadow
of
succession
For
of
no
right
nor
colour
like
to
right
He
doth
fill
fields
with
harness
in
the
realm
Turns
head
against
the
lions
armed
jaws
And
Being
no
more
in
debt
to
years
than
thou
Leads
ancient
lords
and
reverend
Bishops
on
To
bloody
battles
and
to
bruising
arms
What
neverdying
honour
hath
he
got
Against
renowmed
Douglas
whose
high
deeds
Whose
hot
incursions
and
great
name
in
arms
Holds
from
all
soldiers
chief
majority
And
military
title
capital
Through
all
the
kingdoms
that
acknowledge
Christ
Thrice
hath
this
Hotspur
Mars
in
swathling
clothes
This
infant
warrior
in
his
enterprises
Discomfited
great
Douglas
taen
him
once
Enlarged
him
and
made
a
friend
of
him
To
fill
the
mouth
of
deep
defiance
up
And
shake
the
peace
and
safety
of
our
throne
And
what
say
you
to
this
Percy
Northumberland
The
Archbishops
Grace
of
York
Douglas
Mortimer
Capitulate
against
us
and
are
up
But
wherefore
do
I
tell
these
news
to
thee
Why
Harry
do
I
tell
thee
of
my
foes
Which
art
my
nearest
and
dearest
enemy
Thou
that
art
like
enough
through
vassal
fear
Base
inclination
and
the
start
of
spleen
To
fight
against
me
under
Percys
pay
To
dog
his
heels
and
curtsy
at
his
frowns
To
show
how
much
thou
art
degenerate
Prince
Do
not
think
so
You
shall
not
find
it
so
And
God
forgive
them
that
so
much
have
swayd
Your
Majestys
good
thoughts
away
from
me
I
will
redeem
all
this
on
Percys
head
And
in
the
closing
of
some
glorious
day
Be
bold
to
tell
you
that
I
am
your
son
When
I
will
wear
a
garment
all
of
blood
And
stain
my
favours
in
a
bloody
mask
Which
washd
away
shall
scour
my
shame
with
it
And
that
shall
be
the
day
wheneer
it
lights
That
this
same
child
of
honour
and
renown
This
gallant
Hotspur
this
allpraised
knight
And
your
unthought
of
Harry
chance
to
meet
For
every
honour
sitting
on
his
helm
Would
they
were
multitudes
and
on
my
head
My
shames
redoubled
For
the
time
will
come
That
I
shall
make
this
Northern
youth
exchange
His
glorious
deeds
for
my
indignities
Percy
is
but
my
factor
good
my
lord
To
engross
up
glorious
deeds
on
my
behalf
And
I
will
call
hall
to
so
strict
account
That
he
shall
render
every
glory
up
Yea
even
the
slightest
worship
of
his
time
Or
I
will
tear
the
reckoning
from
his

This
in
the
name
of
God
I
promise
here
The
which
if
he

pleasd
I

I
do

may
salve
The

If

Mess
He
did
my
lord
four
days
ere
I
set
forth
And
at
the
time
of
my
departure
thence
He
was
much
feard
by
his
physicians
Wor
I
would
the
state
of
time
had
first
been
whole
Ere
he
by
sickness
had
been
visited
His
health
was
never
better
worth
than
now
Hot
Sick
now
droop
now
This
sickness
doth
infect
The
very
lifeblood
of
our
enterprise
Tis
catching
hither
even
to
our
camp
He
writes
me
here
that
inward
sickness
And
that
his
friends
by
deputation
could
not
So
soon
be
drawn
no
did
he
think
it
meet
To
lay
so
dangerous
and
dear
a
trust
On
any
soul
removd
but
on
his
own
Yet
doth
he
give
us
bold
advertisement
That
with
our
small
conjunction
we
should
on
To
see
how
fortune
is
disposd
to
us
For
as
he
writes
there
is
no
quailing
now
Because
the
King
is
certainly
possessd
Of
all
our
purposes
What
say
you
to
it
Wor
Your
fathers
sickness
is
a
maim
to
us
Hot
perilous
gash
a
very
limb
loppd
off
And
yet
in
faith
it
is
not
His
present
want
Seems
more
than
we
shall
find
it
Were
it
good
To
set
the
exact
wealth
of
all
our
states
All
at
one
cast
to
set
so
rich
a
man
On
the
nice
hazard
of
one
doubtful
hour
It
were
not
good
for
therein
should
we
read
The
very
bottom
and
the
soul
of
hope
The
very
list
the
very
utmost
bound
Of
all
our
fortunes
Doug
Faith
and
so
we
should
Where
now
remains
a
sweet
reversion
We
may
boldly
spend
upon
the
hope
of
what
Is
to
come
in
comfort
of
retirement
lives
in
this
Hot
rendezvous
a
home
to
fly
unto
If
that
the
devil
and
mischance
look
big
Upon
the
maidenhead
of
our
affairs
Wor
But
yet
I
would
your
father
had
been
here
The
quality
and
hair
of
our
attempt
Brooks
no
division
It
will
be
thought
By
some
that
know
not
why
he
is
away
That
wisdom
loyalty
and
mere
dislike
Of
our
proceedings
kept
the
Earl
from
hence
And
think
how
such
an
apprehension
May
turn
the
tide
of
fearful
faction
And
breed
a
kind
of
question
in
our
cause
For
well
you
know
we
of
the
offring
side
Must
keep
aloof
from
strict
arbitrement
And
stop
all
sightholes
every
loop
from
whence
The
eye
of
reason
may
pry
in
upon
us
This
absence
of
your
fathers
draws
a
curtain
That
shows
the
ignorant
a
kind
of
fear
Before
not
dreamt
of
Hot
You
strain
too
far
I
rather
of
his
absence
make
this
use
It
lends
a
lustre
and
more
great
opinion
larger
dare
to
our
great
enterprise
Than
if
the
Earl
were
here
for
men
must
think
If
we
without
his
help
can
make
a
head
To
push
against
a
kingdom
with
his
help
We
shall
oerturn
it
topsyturvy
down
Yet
all
goes
well
yet
all
our
joints
are
whole

Welcome
Sir

Some

love
you

those
some
Envy
your

Because
you

But
stand
against

And
God
defend
but
still
I
should
stand
so
So
long
as
out

rule
You
stand
against
anointed
majesty
But
to
my
charge
The
King
hath
sent
to
know
The
nature
of
your
griefs
and
whereupon
You
conjure
from
the
breast
of
civil
peace
Such
bold
hostility
teaching
his
duteous
land
Audacious
cruelty
If
that
the
King
Have
any
way
your
good
deserts
forgot
Which
he
confesseth
to
be
manifold
He
bids
you
name
your
griefs
and
with
all
speed
You
shall
have
your
desires
with
interest
And
pardon
absolute
for
yourself
and
these
Herein
misled
by
your
suggestion
Hot
The
King
is
kind
and
well
we
know
the
King
Knows
at
what
time
to
promise
when
to
pay
My
father
and
my
uncle
and
myself
Did
give
him
that
same
royalty
he
wears
And
when
he
was
not
sixandtwenty
strong
Sick
in
the
worlds
regard
wretched
and
low
poor
unminded
outlaw
sneaking
home
My
father
gave
him
welcome
to
the
shore
And
when
he
heard
him
swear
and
vow
to
God
He
came
but
to
be
Duke
of
Lancaster
To
sue
his
livery
and
beg
his
peace
With
tears
of
innocency
and
terms
of
zeal
My
father
in
kind
heart
and
pity
movd
Swore
him
assistance
and
performed
it
too
Now
when
the
lords
and
barons
of
the
realm
Perceivd
Northumberland
did
lean
to
him
The
more
and
less
came
in
with
cap
and
knee
Met
him
on
boroughs
cities
villages
Attended
him
on
bridges
stood
in
lanes
Laid
gifts
before
him
profferd
him
their
oaths
Give
him
their
heirs
as
pages
followed
him
Even
at
the
heels
in
golden
multitudes
He
presently
as
greatness
knows
itself
Steps
me
a
little
higher
than
his
vow
Made
to
my
father
while
his
blood
was
poor
Upon
the
naked
shore
at
Ravenspurgh
And
now
forsooth
takes
on
him
to
reform
Some
certain
edicts
and
some
strait
decrees
That
lie
too
heavy
on
the
commonwealth
Cries
out
upon
abuses
seems
to
weep
Over
his
countrys
wrongs
and
by
this
face
This
seeming
brow
of
justice
did
he
win
The
hearts
of
all
that
he
did
angle
for
Proceeded
further
cut
me
off
the
heads
Of
all
the
favourites
that
the
absent
King
In
deputation
left
behind
him
here
When
he
was
personal
in
the
Irish
war
But
Tut
I
came
not
to
hear
this
Hot
Then
to
the
point
In
short
time
after
lie
deposd
the
King
Soon
after
that
deprivd
him
of
his
life
And
in
the
neck
of
that
taskd
the
whole
state
To
make
that
worse
suffred
his
kinsman
March
Who
is
if
every
owner
were
well
placid
Indeed
his
king
to
be
engagd
in
Wales
There
without
ransom
to
lie
forfeited
Disgracd
me
in
my
happy
victories
Sought
to
entrap
me
by
intelligence
Rated
mine
uncle
from
the
Council
board
In
rage
dismissd
my
father
from
the
court
Broke
an
oath
on
oath
committed
wrong
on
wrong
And
in
conclusion
drove
us
to
seek
out
This
head
of
safety
and
withal
to
pry
Into
his
title
the
which
we
find
Too
indirect

continuance

Not

Sir
Walter
Well
withdraw
awhile
Go

let
there
be
impawnd
Some
surety
for
a

return
again
And
In

morning
early
shall
mine
uncle
Bring
him
our
purposes

so
farewell

To

My

I
guess
their
tenour

Like
enough
you

Tomorrow
good
Sir
Michael
is
a
day
Wherein
the
fortune
of
ten
thousand
men
Must
bide
the
touch
for
sir
at
Shrewsbury
As
I
am
truly
given
to
understand
The
King
with
mighty
and
quickraised
power
Meets
with
Lord
Harry
and
I
fear
Sir
Michael
What
with
the
sickness
of
Northumberland
Whose
power
was
in
the
first
proportion
And
what
with
Owen
Glendowers
absence
thence
Who
with
them
was
a
rated
sinew
too
And
comes
not
in
overruld
by
prophecies
I
fear
the
power
of
Percy
is
too
weak
To
wage
an
instant
trial
with
the
King
Sir
Why
my
good
lord
you
need
not
fear
There
is
Douglas
and
Lord
Mortimer
Arch
No
Mortimer
is
not
there
Sir
But
there
is
Mordake
Vernon
Lord
Harry
Percy
And
there
is
my
Lord
of
Worcester
and
a
head
Of
gallant
warriors
noble
gentlemen
Arch
And
so
there
is
but
yet
the
King
hath
drawn
The
special
head
of
all
the
land
together
The
Prince
of
Wales
Lord
John
of
Lancaster
The
noble
Westmoreland
and
warlike

And
many

dear

Of

Sir
Doubt
not
my

shall
be

no

speed
For
if
Lord
Percy
thrive
not

the

Dismiss
his

he
means
to
visit
us
For
he
hath
heard
of
our
confederacy
And
tis
but
wisdom
to
make
strong
against
him
Therefore
make
haste
I
must
go

The

my
Lord

Tis
not

That
you

I
should
meet
upon
such
terms
As
now
we
meet
You
have
deceivd
our
trust
And
made
us
doff
our
easy
robes

peace
To
crush
our
old
limbs
in
ungentle
steel

it
Will
you
again
unknit
This
churlish
knot
of

And
move
in
that
obedient

again
Where
you
did

natural
light
And

Of

For

To
entertain

With
quiet
hours
for
I
do
protest
I
have
not

of
this
dislike

Rebellion

Wor
It
pleasd
your
Majesty
to
turn
your
looks
Of
favour
from
myself
and
all
our

And
yet
I
must
remember
you
my
lord
We
were
the
first
and
dearest
of
your
friends
For
you
my
staff
of
office
did
I
break
In
Richards
time
and
posted
day
and
night
To
meet
you
on
the
way
and
kiss
your
hand
When
yet
you
were
in
place
and
in
account
Nothing
so
strong
and
fortunate
as
I
It
was
myself
my
brother
and
his
son
That
brought
you
home
and
boldly
did
outdare
The
dangers
of
the
time
You
swore
to
us
And
you
did
swear
that
oath
at
Doncaster
That
you
did
nothing
purpose
gainst
the
state
Nor
claim
no
further
than
your
newfalln
right
The
seat
of
Gaunt
dukedom
of
Lancaster
To
this
we
swore
our
aid
But
in
short
space
It
it
raind
down
fortune
showring
on
your
head
And
such
a
flood
of
greatness
fell
on
you
What
with
our
help
what
with
the
absent
King
What
with
the
injuries
of
a
wanton
time
The
seeming
sufferances
that
you
had
borne
And
the
contrarious
winds
that
held
the
King
So
long
in
his
unlucky
Irish
wars
That
all
in
England
did
repute
him
dead
And
from
this
swarm
of
fair
advantages
You
took
occasion
to
be
quickly
wood
To
gripe
the
general
sway
into
your
hand
Forgot
your
oath
to
us
at
Doncaster
And
being
fed
by
us
you
usd
us
so
As
that
ungentle
gull
the
cuckoos
bird
Useth
the
sparrow
did
oppress
our
nest
Grew
by
our
feeding
to
so
great
a
bulk
That
even
our
love
thirst
not
come
near
your
sight
For
fear
of
swallowing
but
with
nimble
wing
We
were
enforcd
for
safety
sake
to
fly
Out
of
your
sight
and
raise
this
present
head
Whereby
we
stand
opposed
by
such
means
As
you
yourself
have
forgd
against
yourself
By
unkind
usage
dangerous
countenance
And
violation
of
all
faith
and
troth
Sworn
to
tis
in
your
younger
enterprise
King
These
things
indeed
you
have
articulate
Proclaimd
at
market
crosses
read
in
churches
To
face
the
garment
of
rebellion
With
some
fine
colour
that
may
please
the
eye
Of
fickle
changelings
and
poor
discontents
Which
gape
and
rub
the
elbow
at
the
news
Of
hurlyburly
innovation
And
never
yet
did
insurrection
want
Such
water
colours
to
impaint
his
cause
Nor
moody
beggars
starving
for
a
time
Of
pellmell
havoc
and
confusion
Prince
In
both
our
armies
there
is
many
a
soul
Shall
pay
full
dearly
for
this
encounter
If
once
they
join
in
trial
Tell
your
nephew
The
Prince
of
Wales
doth
join
with
all
the

In
praise
of
Henry
Percy
By
my
hopes
This
present
enterprise
set
off
his
head
I
do
not
think
a
braver
gentleman
More
activevaliant
or
more
valiantyoung
More
daring
or
more
bold
is
now
alive
To
grace
this
latter
age
with
noble
deeds
For
my
part
I
may
speak
it
to
my
shame
I
have
a
truant
been
to
chivalry
And
so
I
hear
he
doth
account
me
too
Yet
this
before
my
fathers
Majesty
I
am
content
that
he
shall
take
the
odds
Of
his
great
name
and
estimation
And
will
to
save
the
blood
on
either
side
Try
fortune
with
him
in
a
single
fight

And
Prince
of
Wales

dare

venture
thee
Albeit

infinite
Do

No
good
Worcester
no
We
love
our
people
well
even
those
we
love
That
are
misled
upon
your
cousins
part
And
will
they
take
the
offer
of
our
grace
Both
he
and
they
and
you
yea
every
man
Shall
be
my
friend
again
and
Ill
be
his
So
tell
your
cousin
and
bring
me
word
What
he
will
do
But
if
he
will
not
yield
Rebuke
and
dread
correction
wait
on
us
And
they
shall
do
their
office
So
be
gone
We
will
not
now
be
troubled
with
reply
We
offer
fair
take
it
advisedly
Prince
It
will
not
be
accepted
on
my
life
The
Douglas
and
the
Hotspur
both
together
Are
confident
against
the
world
in
arms
King
Hence
therefore
every
leader
to
his
charge
For
on
their
answer
will
we
set
on
them
And
God
befriend
us
as
our
cause
is
just
Fal
Hal
if
thou
see
me
down
in
the
battle
and
bestride
me
so
Tis
a
point
of
friendship
Prince
Nothing
but
a
Colossus
can
do
thee
that
friendship
Say
thy
prayers
and
farewell
Fal
I
would
twere
bedtime
Hal
and
all
well
Prince
Why
thou
owest
God
a
death
Fal
Tis
not
due
yet
I
would
be
loath
to
pay
him
before
his
day
What
need
I
be
so
forward
with
him
that
calls
not
on
me
Well
tis
no
matter
honour
pricks
me
on
Yea
but
how
if
honour
prick
me
off
when
I
come
on
How
then
Can
honor
set
to
a
leg
No
Or
an
arm
No
Or
take
away
the
grief
of
a
wound
No
Honour
hath
no
skill
in
surgery
then
No
What
is
honour
word
What
is
that
word
honour
Air
trim
reckoning
Who
hath
it
He
that
died
a
Wednesday
Doth
he
feel
it
No
Doth
be
bear
it
No
Tis
insensible
then
Yea
to
the
dead
But
will
it
not
live
with
the
living
No
Why
Detraction
will
not
suffer
it
Therefore
Ill
none
of
it
Honour
is
a
mere
scutcheon
and
so
ends
my
catechism
Scene
The
rebel
camp
Enter
Worcester
and
Sir
Richard
Vernon
Wor
no
my
nephew
must
not
know
Sir
Richard
The
liberal
and
kind
offer
of
the
King
Ver
Twere
best
he
did
Wor
Then
are
we
all
undone
It
is
not
possible
it
cannot
be
The
King
should
keep
his
word
in
loving
us
He
will
suspect
us
still
and
find
a
time
To
punish
this
offence
in
other
faults
Suspicion
all
our
lives
shall
be
stuck
full
of
eyes
For
treason
is
but
trusted
like
the
fox
Who
neer
so
tame
so
cherishd
and
lockd
up
Will
have
a
wild
trick
of
his
ancestors
Look
how
we
can
or
sad
or
merrily
Interpretation
will
misquote
our
looks
And
we
shall
feed
like
oxen
at
a
stall
The
better
cherishd
still
the
nearer
death
My
nephews
trespass
may
be
well
forgot
It
hath
the
excuse
of
youth
and
heat
of
blood
And
an
adopted
name
of
privilege
harebrained
Hotspur
governd
by
a
spleen
All
his
offences
live
upon
my
head
And
on
his
fathers
We
did
train
him
on
And
his
corruption
being
taken
from
us
We
as
the
spring
of
all
shall
pay
for
all
Therefore
good
cousin
let
not
Harry
know
In
any
case
the
offer
of
the
King
Enter
Hotspur
and
Douglas
Ver
Deliver
what

Ill
say

Here

My

Deliver

Westmoreland
Uncle

The
King

Doug
Defy

the
Lord
Of
Westmoreland
Hot
Lord
Douglas
go
you
and
tell
him
so
Doug
Marry
and
shall
and
very
willingly
Wor
There
is
no
seeming
mercy
in
the
King
Hot
Did
you
beg
any
God
forbid
Wor
I
told
him
gently
of
our
grievances
Of
his
oathbreaking
which
he
mended
thus
By
now
forswearing
that
he
is
forsworn
He
calls
us
rebels
traitors
aid
will
scourge
With
haughty
arms
this
hateful
name
in
us
Enter
Douglas
Doug
Arm
gentlemen
to
arms
for
I
have
thrown
brave
defiance
in
King
Henrys
teeth
And
Westmoreland
that
was
engagd
did
bear
it
Which
cannot
choose
but
bring
him
quickly
on
Wor
The
Prince
of
Wales
steppd
forth
before
the
King
And
nephew
challengd
you
to
single
fight
Hot
would
the
quarrel
lay
upon
our
heads
And
that
no
man
might
draw
short
breath
today
But
I
and
Harry
Monmouth
Tell
me
tell
me
How
showd
his
tasking
Seemd
it
in
contempt
No
by
my
soul
I
never
in
my
life
Did
hear
a
challenge
urgd
more
modestly
Unless
a
brother
should
a
brother
dare
To
gentle
exercise
and
proof
of
arms
He
gave
you
all
the
duties
of
a
man
Trimmd
up
your
praises
with
a
princely
tongue
Spoke
your
deservings
like
a
chronicle
Making
you
ever
better
than
his
praise
By
still
dispraising
praise
valued
with
you
And
which
became
him
like
a
prince
indeed
He
made
a
blushing
cital
of
himself
And
chid
his
truant
youth
with
such
a
grace
As
if
lie
mastred
there
a
double
spirit
Of
teaching
and
of
learning
instantly
There
did
he
pause
but
let
me
tell
the
world
If
he
outlive
the
envy
of
this
day
England
did
never
owe
so
sweet
a
hope
So
much
misconstrued
in
his
wantonness
Hot
Cousin
I
think
thou
art
enamoured
Upon
his
follies
Never
did
I
hear
Of
any
prince
so
wild
a
libertine
But
be
he
as
he
will
yet
once
ere
night
I
will
embrace
him
with
a
soldiers
arm
That
he
shall
shrink
under
my
courtesy
Arm
arm
with
speed
and
fellows
soldiers
friends
Better
consider
what
you
have
to
do
Than
I
that
have
not
well
the
gift
of
tongue
Can
lift
your
blood
up
with
persuasion
Enter

Mess
My

To

that
shortness
basely
were
too
long
If
life
did
ride
upon
a

point
Still
ending
at
the
arrival
of
an
hour
An
if

live
to
tread
on
kings
If
die
brave
death
when

Now

courtesy
Here

Hot
Harry
thou
hast
robbd
me
of
my
youth
I
better
brook
the
loss
of
brittle
life
Than
those
proud
titles
thou
hast
won
of
me
They
wound
my
thoughts
worse
than
thy
sword
my
flesh
But
thoughts
the
slave
of
life
and
life
times
fool
And
time
that
takes
survey
of
all
the
world
Must
have
a
stop
I
could
prophesy
But
that
the
earthy
and
cold
hand
of
death
Lies
on
my
tongue
No

Dies

how
much
art
thou
shrunk
When
that
this

did
contain
a

kingdom
for
it
was
too
small
a
bound
But
now
two
paces
of
the
vilest
earth
Is
room
enough
This
earth
that
bears
thee
dead
Bears
not
alive
so
stout
a
gentleman
If
thou
wert
sensible
of
courtesy
I
should
not
make
so
dear
a
show
of
zeal
But
let
my
favours
hide
thy
mangled
face
And
even
in
thy
behalf
Ill
thank
myself
For
doing
these
fair
rites
of
tenderness
Adieu
and
take
thy
praise
with
thee
to
heaven
Thy
ignominy
sleep
with
thee
in
the
grave
But
not
remembred
in
thy
epitaph
He
spieth
Falstaff
on
the
ground
What
old
acquaintance
Could
not
all
this
flesh
Keep
in
a
little
life
Poor
Jack
farewell
I
could
have
better
spard
a
better
man
I
should
have
a
heavy
miss
of
thee
If
I
were
much
in
love
with
vanity
Death
hath
not
struck
so
fat
a

today
Though
many
dearer
in
this
bloody
fray
Embowelld
will
I
see
thee
byandby
Till
then
in
blood
by
noble
Percy
lie
Falstaff
riseth
up
Fal
Embowelld
If
thou
embowel
me
today
Ill
give
you
leave
to
powder
me
and
eat
me
too
tomorrow
Sblood
twas
time
to
counterfeit
or
that
hot
termagant
Scot
had
paid
me
scot
and
lot
too
Counterfeit
I
lie
I
am
no
counterfeit
To
die
is
to
be
a
counterfeit
for
he
is
but
the
counterfeit
of
a
man
who
hath
not
the
life
of
a
man
but
to
counterfeit
dying
when
a
man
thereby
liveth
is
to
be
no
counterfeit
but
the
true
and
perfect
image
of
life
indeed
The
better
part
of
valour
is
discretion
in
the
which
better
part
I
have
saved
my
life
Zounds
I
am
afraid
of
this
gunpowder
Percy
though
he
be
dead
How
if
he
should
counterfeit
too
and
rise
By
my
faith
I
am
afraid
he
would
prove
the
better
counterfeit
Therefore
Ill
make
him
sure
yea
and
Ill
swear
I
killd
him
Why
may
not
he
rise
as
well
as
I
Nothing
confutes
me
but
eyes
and
nobody
sees
me
Therefore
sirrah
stabs
him
with
a
new
wound
in
your
thigh
come
you
along
with
me
He
takes
up
Hotspur
on
his
hack
Enter
Prince
and
John
of
Lancaster
Prince
Come
brother
John
full
bravely
hast
thou
fleshd
Thy
maiden
sword
John
But
soft
whom
have
we
here
Did
you
not
tell
me
this
fat
man
was
dead
Prince
I
did
I
saw
him
dead
Breathless
and
bleeding
on
the
ground
Art
thou
alive
Or
is
it
fantasy
that
plays
upon
our
eyesight
I
prithee
speak
We
will
not
trust
our
eyes
Without
our
ears
Thou
art
not
what
thou
seemst
Fal
No
thats
certain
I
am
not
a
double
man
but
if
I
be
not
Jack
Falstaff
then
am
I
a
Jack
There
s
Percy
If
your
father
will
do
me
any
honour
so
if
not
let
him
kill
the
next
Percy
himself
I
look
to
be
either
earl
or
duke
I
can
assure
you
Prince
Why
Percy
I
killd
myself
and
saw
thee
dead
Fal
Didst
thou
Lord
Lord
how
this
world
is
given
to
lying
I
grant
you
I
was
down
and
out
of
breath
and
so
was
he
but
we
rose
both
at
an
instant
and
fought
a
long
hour
by
Shrewsbury
clock
If
I
may
be
believd
so
if
not
let
them
that
should
reward
valour
bear
the
sin
upon
their
own
heads
Ill
take
it
upon
my
death
I
gave
him
this
wound
in
the
thigh
If
the
man
were
alive
and
would
deny
it
zounds
I
would
make
him
eat
a
piece
of
my
sword
John
This
is
the
strangest
tale
that
ever
I
beard
Prince
This
is
the
strangest
fellow
brother
John
Come
bring
your
luggage
nobly
on
your
back
For
my
part
if
a
lie
may
do
thee
grace
Ill
gild
it
with
the
happiest
terms

The

Come

the
highest
of

To
see
what
friends
are
living
who
are
dead
Fal
Ill
follow
as
they
say
for
reward
He
that
rewards
me
God
reward
him
If
I
do
grow
great
Ill
grow
less

Ill
purge
and
leave
sack
and
live
cleanly
as
a

should
do

The

Enter

not
we
send

Pardon
and

And

Misuse
the

Three

Betwixt

true

Wor
What
I
have
done

And
I
embrace
this

patiently
Since
not

it
fails
on
me
King
Bear
Worcester
to
the
death
and
Vernon
too
Other
offenders
we
will
pause
upon
How
goes
the
field
Prince
The
noble
Scot
Lord
Douglas
when
he
saw
The
fortune
of
the
day
quite
turnd
from
him
The
Noble
Percy
slain
and
all
his
men
Upon
the
foot
of
fear
fled
with
the
rest
And
falling
from
a
hillhe
was
so
bruisd
That
the
pursuers
took
him
At
my
tent
The
Douglas
is
and
I
beseech
Your
Grace
I
may
dispose
of
him
King
With
all
my
heart
Prince
Then
brother
John
of
Lancaster
to
you
This
honourable
bounty
shall
belong
Go
to
the
Douglas
and
deliver
him
Up
to
his
pleasure
ransomless
and
free
His
valour
shown
upon
our
crests
today
Hath
taught
us
how
to
cherish
such
high
deeds
Even
in
the
bosom
of
our
adversaries
John
I
thank
your
Grace
for
this
high
courtesy
Which
I
shall
give
away
immediately
King
Then
this
remains
that
we
divide
our
power
You
son
John
and
my
cousin
Westmoreland
Towards
York
shall
bend
you
with
your
dearest
speed
To
meet
Northumberland
and
the
prelate
Scroop
Who
as
we
hear
are
busily
in
arms
Myself
and
you
son
Harry
will
towards
Wales
To
fight
with
Glendower
and
the
Earl
of
March
Rebellion
in
this
laud
shall
lose
his
sway
Meeting
the
check
of
such
another
day
And
since
this
business
so
fair
is
done
Let
us
not
leave
till
all
our
own
be
won
Sirrah
you
giant
what
says
the
doctor
to
my
water
He
said
sir
the
water
itself
was
a
good
healthy
water
but
for
the
party
that
owed
it
he
might
have
moe
diseases
than
he
knew
for
Men
of
all
sorts
take
a
pride
to
gird
at
me
The
brain
of
this
foolishcompounded
clay
man
is
not
able
to
invent
anything
that
intends
to
laughter
more
than
I
invent
or
is
invented
on
me
I
am
not
only
witty
in
myself
but
the
cause
that
wit
is
in
other
men
I
do
here
walk
before
thee
like
a
sow
that
hath
overwhelmd
all
her
litter
but
one
If
the
Prince
put
thee
into
my
service
for
any
other
reason
than
to
set
me
off
why
then
I
have
no
judgment
Thou
whoreson
mandrake
thou
art
fitter
to
be
worn
in
my
cap
than
to
wait
at
my
heels
I
was
never
mannd
with
an
agate
till
now
but
I
will
inset
you
neither
in
gold
nor
silver
but
in
vile
apparel
and
send
you
back
again
to
your
master
for
a
jewel
the
juvenal
the
Prince
your
master
whose
chin
is
not
yet
fledge
I
will
sooner
have
a
beard
grow
in
the
palm
of
my
hand
than
he
shall
get
one
off
his
cheek
and
yet
he
will
not
stick
to
say
his
face
is
a
faceroyal
God
may
finish
it
when
he
will
tis
not
a
hair
amiss
yet
He
may
keep
it
still
at
a
faceroyal
for
a
barber
shall
never
earn
sixpence
out
of
it
and
yet
hell
be
crowing
as
if
he
had
writ
man
ever
since
his
father
was
a
bachelor
He
may
keep
his
own
grace
but
hes
almost
out
of
mine
I
can
assure
him
What
said
Master
Dommelton
about
the
satin
for
my
short
cloak
and
my
slops
He
said
sir
you
should
procure
him
better
assurance
than
Bardolph
He
would
not
take
his
band
and
yours
he
liked
not
the
security
Let
him
be
damnd
like
the
Glutton
pray
God
his
tongue
be
hotter
whoreson
Achitophel
rascalyeaforsooth
knave
to
bear
a
gentleman
in
hand
and
then
stand
upon
security
The
whoreson
smoothpates
do
now
wear
nothing
but
high
shoes
and
bunches
of
keys
at
their
girdles
and
if
a
man
is
through
with
them
in
honest
takingup
then
they
must
stand
upon
security
I
had
as
lief
they
would
put
ratsbane
in
my
mouth
as
offer
to
stop
it
with
security
I
lookd
a
should
have
sent
me
two
and
twenty
yards
of
satin
as
I
am
a
true
knight
and
he
sends
me
security
Well
he
may
sleep
in
security
for
he
hath
the
horn
of
abundance
and
the
lightness
of
his
wife
shines
through
it
and
yet
cannot
he
see
though
he
have
his
own
lanthorn
to
light
him
Wheres
Bardolph
Hes
gone
into
Smithfield
to
buy
your
worship
horse
I
bought
him
in
Pauls
and
hell
buy
me
a
horse
in
Smithfield
An
I
could
get
me
but
a
wife
in
the
stews
I
were
mannd
horsd
and
wivd
Enter
the
and
Sir
here
comes
the
nobleman
that
committed
the
Prince
for
striking
him
about
Bardolph
Wait
close
I
will
not
see
him
Whats
he
that
goes
there
Falstaff
ant
please
your
lordship
He
that
was
in
question
for
the
robbry
He
my
lord
but
he
hath
since
done
good
service
at
Shrewsbury
and
as
I
hear
is
now
going
with
some
charge
to
the
Lord
John
of
Lancaster
What
to
York
Call
him
back
again
Sir
John
Falstaff
Boy
tell
him
I
am
deaf
You
must
speak
louder
my
master
is
deaf
I
am
sure
he
is
to
the
hearing
of
anything
good
Go
pluck
him
by
the
elbow
I
must
speak
with
him
Sir
John
What
a
young
knave
and
begging
Is
there
not
wars
Is
there
not
employment
Doth
not
the
King
lack
subjects
Do
not
the
rebels
need
soldiers
Though
it
be
a
shame
to
be
on
any
side
but
one
it
is
worse
shame
to
beg
than
to
be
on
the
worst
side
were
it
worse
than
the
name
of
rebellion
can
tell
how
to
make
it
You
mistake
me
sir
Why
sir
did
I
say
you
were
an
honest
man
Setting
my
knighthood
and
my
soldiership
aside
I
had
lied
in
my
throat
if
I
had
said
so
I
pray
you
sir
then
set
your
knighthood
and
your
soldiership
aside
and
give
me
leave
to
tell
you
you
in
your
throat
if
you
say
I
am
any
other
than
an
honest
man
I
give
thee
leave
to
tell
me
so
I
lay
aside
that
which
grows
to
me
If
thou
getst
any
leave
of
me
hang
me
if
thou
takst
leave
thou
wert
better
be
hangd
You
hunt
counter
Hence
Avaunt
Sir
my
lord
would
speak
with
you
Sir
John
Falstaff
a
word
with
you
My
good
lord
God
give
your
lordship
good
time
of
day
I
am
glad
to
see
your
lordship
abroad
I
heard
say
your
lordship
was
sick
I
hope
your
lordship
goes
abroad
by
advice
Your
lordship
though
not
clean
past
your
youth
hath
yet
some
smack
of
age
in
you
some
relish
of
the
saltness
of
time
and
I
most
humbly
beseech
your
lordship
to
have
a
reverend
care
of
your
health
Sir
John
I
sent
for
you
before
your
expedition
to
Shrewsbury
Ant
please
your
lordship
I
hear
his
Majesty
is
returnd
with
some
discomfort
from
Wales
I
talk
not
of
his
Majesty
You
would
not
come
when
I
sent
for
you
And
I
hear
moreover
his
Highness
is
falln
into
this
same
whoreson
apoplexy
Well
God
mend
him
I
pray
you
let
me
speak
with
you
This
apoplexy
as
I
take
it
is
a
kind
of
lethargy
ant
please
your
lordship
a
kind
of
sleeping
in
the
blood
a
whoreson
tingling
What
tell
you
me
of
it
Be
it
as
it
is
It
hath
it
original
from
much
grief
from
study
and
perturbation
of
the
brain
I
have
read
the
cause
of
his
effects
in
Galen
it
is
a
kind
of
deafness
I
think
you
are
falln
into
the
disease
for
you
hear
not
what
I
say
to
you
Very
well
my
lord
very
well
Rather
ant
please
you
it
is
the
disease
of
not
listening
the
malady
of
not
marking
that
I
am
troubled
withal
To
punish
you
by
the
heels
would
amend
the
attention
of
your
ears
and
I
care
not
if
I
do
become
your
physician
I
am
as
poor
as
Job
my
lord
but
not
so
patient
Your
lordship
may
minister
the
potion
of
imprisonment
to
me
in
respect
of
poverty
but
how
I
should
be
your
patient
to
follow
your
prescriptions
the
wise
may
make
some
dram
of
a
scruple
or
indeed
a
scruple
itself
I
sent
for
you
when
there
were
matters
against
you
for
your
life
to
come
speak
with
me
As
I
was
then
advisd
by
my
learned
counsel
in
the
laws
of
this
landservice
I
did
not
come
Well
the
truth
is
Sir
John
you
live
in
great
infamy
He
that
buckles
himself
in
my
belt
cannot
live
in
less
Your
means
are
very
slender
and
your
waste
is
great
I
would
it
were
otherwise
I
would
my
means
were
greater
and
my
waist
slenderer
You
have
misled
the
youthful
Prince
The
young
Prince
hath
misled
me
I
am
the
fellow
with
the
great
belly
and
he
my
dog
Well
I
am
loath
to
gall
a
newheald
wound
Your
days
service
at
Shrewsbury
hath
a
little
gilded
over
your
nights
exploit
on
Gadshill
You
may
thank
th
unquiet
time
for
your
quiet
oerposting
that
action
My
lord
But
since
all
is
well
keep
it
so
wake
not
a
sleeping
wolf
To
wake
a
wolf
is
as
bad
as
smell
a
fox
What
you
are
as
a
candle
the
better
part
burnt
out
wassail
candle
my
lord
all
tallow
if
I
did
say
of
wax
my
growth
would
approve
the
truth
There
is
not
a
white
hair
in
your
face
but
should
have
his
effect
of
gravity
His
effect
of
gravy
gravy
You
follow
the
young
Prince
up
and
down
like
his
ill
angel
Not
so
my
lord
Your
ill
angel
is
light
but
hope
he
that
looks
upon
me
will
take
me
without
weighing
And
yet
in
some
respects
I
grant
I
cannot
go
I
cannot
tell
Virtue
is
of
so
little
regard
in
these
costermongers
times
that
true
valour
is
turnd
berod
pregnancy
is
made
a
tapster
and
his
quick
wit
wasted
in
giving
reckonings
all
the
other
gifts
appertinent
to
man
as
the
malice
of
this
age
shapes
them
are
not
worth
a
gooseberry
You
that
are
old
consider
not
the
capacities
of
us
that
are
young
you
do
measure
the
heat
of
our
livers
with
the
bitterness
of
your
galls
and
we
that
are
in
the
vaward
of
our
youth
must
confess
are
wags
too
Do
you
set
down
your
name
in
the
scroll
of
youth
that
are
written
down
old
with
all
the
characters
of
age
Have
you
not
a
moist
eye
a
dry
hand
a
yellow
cheek
a
white
beard
a
decreasing
leg
an
increasing
belly
Is
not
your
voice
broken
your
wind
short
your
chin
double
your
wit
single
and
every
part
about
you
blasted
with
antiquity
And
will
you
yet
call
yourself
young
Fie
fie
fie
Sir
John
My
lord
I
was
born
about
three
of
the
clock
in
the
afternoon
with
a
white
head
and
something
a
round
belly
For
my
voice
I
have
lost
it
with
hallooing
and
singing
of
anthems
To
approve
my
youth
further
I
will
not
The
truth
is
I
am
only
old
in
judgment
and
understanding
and
he
that
will
caper
with
me
for
a
thousand
marks
let
him
lend
me
the
money
and
have
at
him
For
the
box
of
the
ear
that
the
Prince
gave
you
he
gave
it
like
a
rude
prince
and
you
took
it
like
a
sensible
lord
I
have
checkd
him
for
it
and
the
young
lion
repents
marry
not
in
ashes
and
sackcloth
but
in
new
silk
and
old
sack
Well
God
send
the
Prince
a
better
companion
God
send
the
companion
a
better
prince
I
cannot
rid
my
hands
of
him
Well
the
King
hath
severd
you
I
hear
you
are
going
with
Lord
John
of
Lancaster
against
the
Archbishop
and
the
Earl
of
Northumberland
Yea
I
thank
your
pretty
sweet
wit
for
it
But
look
you
pray
all
you
that
kiss
my
Lady
Peace
at
home
that
our
armies
join
not
in
a
hot
day
for
by
the
Lord
I
take
but
two
shirts
out
with
me
and
I
mean
not
to
sweat
extraordinarily
If
it
be
a
hot
day
and
I
brandish
anything
but
a
bottle
I
would
I
might
never
spit
white
again
There
is
not
a
dangerous
action
can
peep
out
his
head
but
I
am
thrust
upon
it
Well
I
cannot
last
ever
but
it
was
alway
yet
the
trick
of
our
English
nation
if
they
have
a
good
thing
to
make
it
too
common
If
ye
will
needs
say
I
am
an
old
man
you
should
give
me
rest
I
would
to
God
my
name
were
not
so
terrible
to
the
enemy
as
it
is
I
were
better
to
be
eaten
to
death
with
a
rust
than
to
be
scoured
to
nothing
with
perpetual
motion
Well
be
honest
be
honest
and
God
bless
your
expedition
Will
your
lordship
lend
me
a
thousand
pound
to
furnish
me
forth
Not
a
penny
not
a
penny
you
are
too
impatient
to
bear
crosses
Fare
you
well
Commend
me
to
my
cousin
Westmoreland
If
I
do
fillip
me
with
a
threeman
beetle
man
can
no
more
separate
age
and
covetousness
than
a
can
part
young
limbs
and
lechery
but
the
gout
galls
the
one
and
the
pox
pinches
the
other
and
so
both
the
degrees
prevent
my
curses
Boy
Sir
What
money
is
in
my
purse
Seven
groats
and
two
pence
I
can
get
no
remedy
against
this
consumption
of
the
purse
borrowing
only
lingers
and
lingers
it
out
but
the
disease
is
incurable
Go
bear
this
letter
to
my
Lord
of
Lancaster
this
to
the
Prince
this
to
the
Earl
of
Westmoreland
and
this
to
old
Mistress
Ursula
whom
I
have
weekly
sworn
to
marry
since
I
perceivd
the
first
white
hair
of
my
chin
About
it
you
know
where
to
find
me
this
pox
for
the
one
or
the
other
plays
the
rogue
with
my
great
toe
Tis
no
matter
if
I
do
halt
I
have
the
wars
for
my
colour
and
my
pension
shall
seem
the
more
reasonable
good
wit
will
make
use
of
anything
I
will
turn
diseases
to
commodity
Before
God
I
am
exceeding
weary
Ist
come
to
that
I
had
thought
weariness
durst
not
have
attachd
one
of
so
high
blood
Faith
it
does
me
though
it
discolours
the
complexion
of
my
greatness
to
acknowledge
it
Doth
it
not
show
vilely
in
me
to
desire
small
beer
Why
a
prince
should
not
be
so
loosely
studied
as
to
remember
so
weak
a
composition
Belike
then
my
appetite
was
notprincely
got
for
by
my
troth
I
do
now
remember
the
poor
creature
small
beer
But
indeed
these
humble
considerations
make
me
out
of
love
with
my
greatness
What
a
disgrace
is
it
to
me
to
remember
thy
name
or
to
know
thy
face
tomorrow
or
to
take
note
how
many
pair
of
silk
stockings
thou
hast
viz
these
and
those
that
were
thy
peachcolourd
ones
or
to
bear
the
inventory
of
thy
shirts
as
one
for
superfluity
and
another
for
use
But
that
the
tenniscourtkeeper
knows
better
than
I
for
it
is
a
low
ebb
of
linen
with
thee
when
thou
keepest
not
racket
there
as
thou
hast
not
done
a
great
while
because
the
rest
of
thy
low
countries
have
made
a
shift
to
eat
up
thy
holland
And
God
knows
whether
those
that
bawl
out
of
the
ruins
of
thy
linen
shall
inherit
his
kingdom
but
the
midwives
say
the
children
are
not
in
the
fault
whereupon
the
world
increases
and
kindreds
are
mightily
strengthened
How
ill
it
follows
after
you
have
laboured
so
hard
you
should
talk
so
idly
Tell
me
how
many
good
young
princes
would
do
so
their
fathers
being
so
sick
as
yours
at
this
time
is
Shall
I
tell
thee
one
thing
Poins
Yes
faith
and
let
it
be
an
excellent
good
thing
It
shall
serve
among
wits
of
no
higher
breeding
than
thine
Go
to
I
stand
the
push
of
your
one
thing
that
you
will
tell
Marry
I
tell
thee
it
is
not
meet
that
I
should
be
sad
now
my
father
is
sick
albeit
I
could
tell
to
thee
as
to
one
it
pleases
me
for
fault
of
a
better
to
call
my
friend
I
could
be
sad
and
sad
indeed
too
Very
hardly
upon
such
a
subject
By
this
hand
thou
thinkest
me
as
far
in
the
devils
book
as
thou
and
Falstaff
for
obduracy
and
persistency
let
the
end
try
the
man
But
I
tell
thee
my
heart
bleeds
inwardly
that
my
father
is
so
sick
and
keeping
such
vile
company
as
thou
art
hath
in
reason
taken
from
me
all
ostentation
of
sorrow
The
reason
What
wouldst
thou
think
of
me
if
I
should
weep
I
would
think
thee
a
most
princely
hypocrite
It
would
be
every
mans
thought
and
thou
art
a
blessed
fellow
to
think
as
every
man
thinks
Never
a
mans
thought
in
the
world
keeps
the
roadway
better
than
thine
Every
man
would
think
me
an
hypocrite
indeed
And
what
accites
your
most
worshipful
thought
to
think
so
Why
because
you
have
been
so
lewd
and
so
much
engraffed
to
Falstaff
And
to
thee
By
this
light
I
am
well
spoke
on
I
can
hear
it
with
mine
own
ears
The
worst
that
they
can
say
of
me
is
that
I
am
a
second
brother
and
that
I
am
a
proper
fellow
of
my
hands
and
those
two
things
I
confess
I
cannot
help
By
the
mass
here
comes
Bardolph
Enter
and
And
the
boy
that
I
gave
Falstaff
had
him
from
me
Christian
and
look
if
the
fat
villain
have
not
transformd
him
ape
God
save
your
Grace
And
yours
most
noble
Bardolph
Come
you
virtuous
ass
you
bashful
fool
must
you
be
blushing
Wherefore
blush
you
now
What
a
maidenly
manatarms
are
you
become
Ist
such
a
matter
to
get
a
pottlepots
maidenhead
calls
me
een
now
my
lord
through
a
red
lattice
and
I
could
discern
no
part
of
his
face
from
the
window
At
last
I
spied
his
eyes
and
methought
he
had
made
two
holes
in
the
alewifes
new
petticoat
and
so
peepd
through
Has
not
the
boy
profited
Away
you
whoreson
upright
rabbit
away
Away
you
rascally
Althaeas
dream
away
Instruct
us
boy
what
dream
boy
Marry
my
lord
Althaea
dreamt
she
was
delivered
of
a
firebrand
and
therefore
I
call
him
her
dream
crowns
worth
of
good
interpretation
There
tis
boy
Giving
a
crown
that
this
blossom
could
be
kept
from
cankers
Well
there
is
sixpence
to
preserve
thee
An
you
do
not
make
him
be
hangd
among
you
the
gallows
shall
have
wrong
And
how
doth
thy
master
Bardolph
Well
my
lord
He
heard
of
your
Graces
coming
to
town
Theres
a
letter
for
you
Deliverd
with
good
respect
And
how
doth
the
martlemas
your
master
In
bodily
health
sir
Marry
the
immortal
part
needs
a
physician
but
that
moves
not
him
Though
that
be
sick
it
dies
not
I
do
allow
this
well
to
be
as
familiar
with
me
as
my
dog
and
he
holds
his
place
for
look
you
how
he
writes
Reads
John
Falstaff
knight
Every
man
must
know
that
as
oft
as
he
has
occasion
to
name
himself
even
like
those
that
are
kin
to
the
King
for
they
never
prick
their
finger
but
they
say
Theres
some
of
the
Kings
blood
spilt
How
comes
that
says
he
that
takes
upon
him
not
to
conceive
The
answer
is
as
ready
as
a
borrowers
cap
I
am
the
Kings
poor
cousin
sir
Nay
they
will
be
kin
to
us
or
they
will
fetch
it
from
Japhet
But
the
letter
Reads
Sir
John
Falstaff
knight
to
the
son
of
the
King
nearest
his
father
Harry
Prince
of
Wales
greeting
Why
this
is
a
certificate
Peace
Reads
I
will
imitate
the
honourable
Romans
in
brevity
He
sure
means
brevity
in
breath
shortwinded
Reads
I
commend
me
to
thee
I
commend
thee
and
I
leave
thee
Be
not
too
familiar
with
Poins
for
he
misuses
thy
favours
so
much
that
he
swears
thou
art
to
marry
his
sister
Nell
Repent
at
idle
times
as
thou
mayst
and
so
farewell
Thine
by
yea
and
no
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
as
thou
usest
him
with
my
familiars
with
my
brothers
and
sisters
and
with
all
Europe
My
lord
Ill
steep
this
letter
in
sack
and
make
him
eat
it
Thats
to
make
him
eat
twenty
of
his
words
But
do
you
use
me
thus
Ned
Must
I
marry
your
sister
God
send
the
wench
no
worse
fortune
But
I
never
said
so
Well
thus
we
play
the
fools
with
the
time
and
the
spirits
of
the
wise
sit
in
the
clouds
and
mock
us
Is

master

in
London
Yea

lord
Where

This
Doll
Tearsheet
should
be
some
road
I
warrant
you
as
common
as
the
way
between
Saint
Albans
and
London
How
might
we
see
Falstaff
bestow
himself
tonight
in
his
true
colours
and
not
ourselves
be
seen
Put
on
two
leathern
jerkins
and
aprons
and
wait
upon
him
at
his
table
as
drawers
From
a
god
to
a
bull
heavy
descension
It
was
Joves
case
From
a
prince
to
a
prentice
low
transformation
That
shall
be
mine
for
in
everything
the
purpose
must
weigh
with
the
folly
Follow

devil

Thou
knowest
Sir
John

endure

The

a
dish
of
applejohns
before

told
him

more
Sir
Johns
and
putting
off
his
hat
said
I
will
now
take
my
leave
of
these
six
dry
round
old
withered
knights
It
angred
him
to
the
heart
but

His

theres
no

conceit
in

Why
does
the

so
then
Because
their

are
both

a
plays

and
wears

How

I

My

out

and
turn
all
to
a

if
you
take
not
the

whoreson

you
how
vilely
did
you
speak
of
me
even
now
before
this
honest
virtuous
civil
gentlewoman
Gods
blessing
of
your
good
heart
and
so
she
is
by
my
troth
Didst
thou
hear
me
Yea
and
you
knew
me
as
you
did
when
you
ran
away
by
Gadshill
You
knew
I
was
at
your
back
and
spoke
it
on
purpose
to
try
my
patience
No
no
no
not
so
I
did
not
think
thou
wast
within
hearing
I
shall
drive
you
then
to
confess
the
wilful
abuse
and
then
I
know
how
to
handle
you
No
abuse
Hal
o
mine
honour
no
abuse
Not
to
dispraise
me
and
call
me
pander
and
breadchipper
and
I
know
not

No

Hal
No
abuse
No

Ned
i
th

I
dispraisd
him
before
the

that
the

might
not
fall
in
love
with
thee
in
which
doing
I
have
done
the
part
of
a
careful
friend
and
a

subject
and
thy

thanks
for
it
No

See
now
whether
pure
fear
and
entire
cowardice
doth
not
make
thee
wrong
this
virtuous
gentlewoman
to
close
with
us
Is
she
of
the
wicked
Is
thine
hostess
here
of
the
wicked
Or
is
thy
boy
of
the
wicked
Or
honest
Bardolph
whose
zeal
burns
in
his
nose
of
the
wicked
Answer
thou
dead

answer
The

hath
prickd
down
Bardolph
irrecoverable
and
his
face
is
Lucifers

where
he
doth
nothing
but
roast
maltworms
For
the
boy
there
is
a
good
angel
about
him
but
the
devil
outbids
him
too
For
the
women
For
one
of
them
shes
in
hell
already
and
burns
poor
souls
For
th
other
I
owe
her
money
and
whether
she
be
damnd
for
that
I
know
not
No
I
warrant
you
No
I
think
thou
art
not
I
think
thou
art
quit
for
that
Marry
there
is
another
indictment
upon
thee
for
suffering
flesh
to
be
eaten
in
thy
house
contrary
to
the
law
for
the
which
I
think
thou
wilt
howl
All
victlers

so
Whats
a
joint
of
mutton
or
two
in
a
whole
Lent
You
gentlewoman
What
says

His

Knocking

Enter
Peto
how
now
What
news
The
King
your
father
is
at
Westminster
And
there
are
twenty
weak
and
wearied
posts
Come
from
the
north
and
as
I
came
along
I
met
and
overtook
a
dozen
captains
Bareheaded
sweating
knocking
at
the
taverns
And
asking
every
one
for
Sir
John
Falstaff
By
heaven
Poins
I
feel
me
much
to
blame
So
idly
to
profane
the
precious
time
When
tempest
of
commotion
like
the
south
Borne
with
black
vapour
doth
begin
to
melt
And
drop
upon
our
bare
unarmed
heads
Give
me
my
sword
and
cloak
Falstaff
good
night
Now
comes
in
the
sweetest
morsel
of
the
night
and
we
must
hence
and
leave
it
unpickd
Knocking
within
More
knocking
at
the
door
Reenter
How

Farewell

Westminster
The

Enter
the
in
his
nightgown
with
a
page
Go
call
the
Earls
of
Surrey
and
of
Warwick
But
ere
they
come
bid
them
oerread
these
letters
And
well
consider
of
them
Make
good
speed
How
many
thousands
of
my
poorest
subjects
Are
at
this
hour
asleep
sleep
gentle
sleep
Natures
soft
nurse
how
have
I
frightened
thee
That
thou
no
more
will
weigh
my
eyelids
down
And
steep
my
senses
in
forgetfulness
Why
rather
sleep
liest
thou
in
smoky
cribs
Upon
uneasy
pallets
stretching
thee
And
hushd
with
buzzing
nightflies
to
thy
slumber
Than
in
the
perfumd
chambers
of
the
great
Under
the
canopies
of
costly
state
And
lulld
with
sound
of
sweetest
melody
thou
dull
god
why
liest
thou
with
the
vile
In
loathsome
beds
and
leavst
the
kingly
couch
watchcase
or
a
common
larumbell
Wilt
thou
upon
the
high
and
giddy
mast
Seal
up
the
shipboys
eyes
and
rock
his
brains
In
cradle
of
the
rude
imperious
surge
And
in
the
visitation
of
the
winds
Who
take
the
ruffian
billows
by
the
top
Curling
their
monstrous
heads
and
hanging
them
With
deafing
clamour
in
the
slippery
clouds
That
with
the
hurly
death
itself
awakes
Canst
thou
partial
sleep
give
thy
repose
To
the
wet
seaboy
in
an
hour
so
rude
And
in
the
calmest
and
most
stillest
night
With
all
appliances
and
means
to
boot
Deny
it
to
a
king
Then
happy
low
lie
down
Uneasy
lies
the
head
that
wears
a
crown
Enter
and
Surrey
Many
good
morrows
to
your
Majesty
Is
it
good
morrow
lords
Tis
one
oclock
and
past
Why
then
good
morrow
to
you
all
my
lords
Have
you
read
oer
the
letters
that
I
sent
you
We
have
my
liege
Then
you
perceive
the
body
of
our
kingdom
How
foul
it
is
what
rank
diseases
grow
And
with
what
danger
near
the
heart
of
it
It
is
but
as
a
body
yet
distempered
Which
to
his
former
strength
may
be
restored
With
good
advice
and
little
medicine
My
Lord
Northumberland
will
soon
be
coold
God
that
one
might
read
the
book
of
fate
And
see
the
revolution
of
the
times
Make
mountains
level
and
the
continent
Weary
of
solid
firmness
melt
itself
Into
the
sea
and
other
times
to
see
The
beachy
girdle
of
the
ocean
Too
wide
for
Neptunes
hips
how
chances
mock
And
changes
fill
the
cup
of
alteration
With
divers
liquors
if
this
were
seen
The
happiest
youth
viewing
his
progress
through
What
perils
past
what
crosses
to
ensue
Would
shut
the
book
and
sit
him
down
and
die
Tis
not
ten
years
gone
Since
Richard
and
Northumberland
great
friends
Did
feast
together
and
in
two
years
after
Were
they
at
wars
It
is
but
eight
years
since
This
Percy
was
the
man
nearest
my
soul
Who
like
a
brother
toild
in
my
affairs
And
laid
his
love
and
life
under
my
foot
Yea
for
my
sake
even
to
the
eyes
of
Richard
Gave
him
defiance
But
which
of
you
was
by
To
You
cousin
Nevil
as
I
may
remember
When
Richard
with
his
eye
brim
full
of
tears
Then
checkd
and
rated
by
Northumberland
Did
speak
these
words
now
provd
a
prophecy
Northumberland
thou
ladder
by
the
which
My
cousin
Bolingbroke
ascends
my
throne
Though
then
God
knows
I
had
no
such
intent
But
that
necessity
so
bowd
the
state
That
I
and
greatness
were
compelld
to
kiss
The
time
shall
come
thus
did
he
follow
it
The
time
will
come
that
foul
sin
gathering
head
Shall
break
into
corruption
so
went
on
Foretelling
this
same
times
condition
And
the
division
of
our
amity
There
is
a
history
in
all
mens
lives
Figuring
the
natures
of
the
times
deceasd
The
which
observd
a
man
may
prophesy
With
a
near
aim
of
the
main
chance
of
things
As
yet
not
come
to
life
who
in
their
seeds
And
weak
beginning
lie
intreasured
Such
things
become
the
hatch
and
brood
of
time
And
by
the
necessary
form
of
this
King
Richard
might
create
a
perfect
guess
That
great
Northumberland
then
false
to
him
Would
of
that
seed
grow
to
a
greater
falseness
Which
should
not
find
a
ground
to
root
upon
Unless
on
you
Are
these
things
then
necessities
Then
let
us
meet
them
like
necessities
And
that
same
word
even
now
cries
out
on
us
They
say
the
Bishop
and
Northumberland
Are
fifty
thousand
strong
It
cannot
be
my
lord
Rumour
doth
double
like
the
voice
and
echo
The
numbers
of
the
feared
Please
it
your
Grace
To
go
to
bed
Upon
my
soul
my
lord
The
powers
that
you
already
have
sent
forth
Shall
bring
this
prize
in
very
easily
To
comfort
you
the
more
I
have
receivd
certain
instance
that
Glendower
is
dead
Your
Majesty
hath
been
this
fortnight
ill
And
these
unseasoned
hours
perforce
must
ad
Unto
your
sickness
I
will
take
your
counsel
And
were
these
inward
wars
once
out
of
hand
We
would
dear
lords
unto
the
Holy
Land
and
others
from
the
other
side
of
and
others
You
are
well
encountred
here
my
cousin
Mowbray
Good
day
to
you
gentle
Lord
Archbishop
And
so
to
you
Lord
Hastings
and
to
all
My
Lord
of
York
it
better
showd
with
you
When
that
your
flock
assembled
by
the
bell
Encircled
you
to
hear
with
reverence
Your
exposition
on
the
holy
text
Than
now
to
see
you
here
an
iron
man
Cheering
a
rout
of
rebels
with
your
drum
Turning
the
word
to
sword
and
life
to
death
That
man
that
sits
within
a
monarchs
heart
And
ripens
in
the
sunshine
of
his
favour
Would
he
abuse
the
countenance
of
the
king
Alack
what
mischiefs
might
he
set
abroach
In
shadow
of
such
greatness
With
you
Lord
Bishop
It
is
even
so
Who
hath
not
heard
it
spoken
How
deep
you
were
within
the
books
of
God
To
us
the
speaker
in
His
parliament
To
us
th
imagind
voice
of
God
himself
The
very
opener
and
intelligencer
Between
the
grace
the
sanctities
of
heaven
And
our
dull
workings
who
shall
believe
But
you
misuse
the
reverence
of
your
place
Employ
the
countenance
and
grace
of
heavn
As
a
false
favourite
doth
his
princes
name
In
deeds
dishonourable
You
have
taen
up
Under
the
counterfeited
zeal
of
God
The
subjects
of
His
substitute
my
father
And
both
against
the
peace
of
heaven
and
him
Have
here
upswarmd
them
Good
my
Lord
of
Lancaster
I
am
not
here
against
your
fathers
peace
But
as
I
told
my
Lord
of
Westmoreland
The
time
misordred
doth
in
common
sense
Crowd
us
and
crush
us
to
this
monstrous
form
To
hold
our
safety
up
I
sent
your
Grace
The
parcels
and
particulars
of
our
grief
The
which
hath
been
with
scorn
shovd
from
the
court
Whereon
this
hydra
son
of
war
is
born
Whose
dangerous
eyes
may
well
be
charmd
asleep
With
grant
of
our
most
just
and
right
desires
And
true
obedience
of
this
madness
curd
Stoop
tamely
to
the
foot
of
majesty
If
not
we
ready
are
to
try
our
fortunes
To
the
last
man
And
though
we
here
fall
down
We
have
supplies
to
second
our
attempt
If
they
miscarry
theirs
shall
second
them
And
so
success
of
mischief
shall
be
born
And
heir
from
heir
shall
hold
this
quarrel
up
Whiles
England
shall
have
generation
are
too
shallow
Hastings
much
to
shallow
To
sound
the
bottom
of
the
aftertimes
Pleaseth
your
Grace
to
answer
them
directly
How
far
forth
you
do
like
their
articles
I
like
them
all
and
do
allow
them
well
And
swear
here
by
the
honour
of
my
blood
My
fathers
purposes
have
been
mistook
And
some
about
him
have
too
lavishly
Wrested
his
meaning
and
authority
My
lord
these
griefs
shall
be
with
speed
redressd
Upon
my
soul
they
shall
If
this
may
please
you
Discharge
your
powers
unto
their
several
counties
As
we
will
ours
and
here
between
the
armies
Lets
drink
together
friendly
and
embrace
That
all
their
eyes
may
bear
those
tokens
home
Of
our
restored
love
and
amity
I
take
your
princely
word
for
these
redresses
I
give
it
you
and
will
maintain
my
word
And
thereupon
I
drink
unto
your
Grace
Go
Captain
and
deliver
to
the
army
This
news
of
peace
Let
them
have
pay
and
part
I
know
it
will
please
them
Hie
thee
Captain
To
you
my
noble
Lord
of
Westmoreland
I
pledge
your
Grace
and
if
you
knew
what
pains
I
have
bestowd
to
breed
this
present
peace
You
would
drink
freely
but
my
love
to
ye
Shall
show
itself
more
openly
hereafter
I
do
not
doubt
you
I
am
glad
of
it
Health
to
my
lord
and
gentle
cousin
Mowbray
You
wish
me
health
in
very
happy
season
For
I
am
on
the
sudden
something
ill
Against
ill
chances
men
are
ever
merry
But
heaviness
foreruns
the
good
event
Therefore
be
merry
coz
since
sudden
sorrow
Serves
to
say
thus
Some
good
thing
comes
tomorrow
Believe
me
I
am
passing
light
in
spirit
So
much
the
worse
if
your
own
rule
be
true
Shouts
within
The
word
of
peace
is
rendred
Hark
how
they
shout
This
had
been
cheerful
after
victory
peace
is
of
the
nature
of
a
conquest
For
then
both
parties
nobly
are
subdud
And
neither
party
loser
Go
my
lord
And
let
our
army
be
discharged
too
And
good
my
lord
so
please
you
let
our
trains
March
by
us
that
we
may
peruse
the
men
We
should
have
copd
withal
Go
good
Lord
Hastings
And
ere
they
be
dismissd
let
them
march
by
I
trust
lords
we
shall
lie
tonight
together
Reenter
Now
cousin
wherefore
stands
our
army
still
The
leaders
having
charge
from
you
to
stand
Will
not
go
off
until
they
hear
you
speak
They
know
their
duties
Reenter
My
lord
our
army
is
dispersd
already
Like
youthful
steers
unyokd
they
take
their
courses
East
west
north
south
or
like
a
school
broke
up
Each
hurries
toward
his
home
and
sportingplace
Good
tidings
my
Lord
Hastings
for
the
which
I
do
arrest
thee
traitor
of
high
treason
And
you
Lord
Archbishop
and
you
Lord
Mowbray
Of
capital
treason
I
attach
you
both
Is
this
proceeding
just
and
honourable
Is
your
assembly
so
Will
you
thus
break
your
faith
I
pawnd
thee
none
I
promisd
you
redress
of
these
same
grievances
Whereof
you
did
complain
which
by
mine
honour
I
will
perform
with
a
most
Christian
care
But
for
you
rebels
look
to
taste
the
due
Meet
for
rebellion
and
such
acts
as
yours
Most
shallowly
did
you
these
arms
commence
Fondly
brought
here
and
foolishly
sent
hence
Strike
up
our
drums
pursue
the
scattred
stray
God
and
not
we
hath
safely
fought
today
Some
guard
these
traitors
to
the
block
of
death
Treasons
true
bed
and
yielderup
of
breath
and
others
Now
lords
if
God
doth
give
successful
end
To
this
debate
that
bleedeth
at
our
doors
We
will
our
youth
lead
on
to
higher
fields
And
draw
no
swords
but
what
are
sanctified
Our
navy
is
addressd
our
power
connected
Our
substitutes
in
absence
well
invested
And
everything
lies
level
to
our
wish
Only
we
want
a
little
personal
strength
And
pause
us
till
these
rebels
now
afoot
Come
underneath
the
yoke
of
government
Both
which
we
doubt
not
but
your
Majesty
Shall
soon
enjoy
Humphrey
my
son
of
Gloucester
Where
is
the
Prince
your
brother
I
think
hes
gone
to
hunt
my
lord
at
Windsor
And
how
accompanied
I
do
not
know
my
lord
Is
not
his
brother
Thomas
of
Clarence
with
him
No
my
good
lord
he
is
in
presence
here
What
would
my
lord
and
father
Nothing
but
well
to
thee
Thomas
of
Clarence
How
chance
thou
art
not
with
the
Prince
thy
brother
He
loves
thee
and
thou
dost
neglect
him
Thomas
Thou
hast
a
better
place
in
his
affection
Than
all
thy
brothers
cherish
it
my
boy
And
noble
offices
thou
mayst
effect
Of
mediation
after
I
am
dead
Between
his
greatness
and
thy
other
brethren
Therefore
omit
him
not
blunt
not
his
love
Nor
lose
the
good
advantage
of
his
grace
By
seeming
cold
or
careless
of
his
will
For
he
is
gracious
if
he
be
observd
He
hath
a
tear
for
pity
and
a
hand
Open
as
day
for
melting
charity
Yet
notwithstanding
being
incensd
he
is
flint
As
humorous
as
winter
and
as
sudden
As
flaws
congealed
in
the
spring
of
day
His
temper
therefore
must
be
well
observd
Chide
him
for
faults
and
do
it
reverently
When
you
perceive
his
blood
inclind
to
mirth
But
being
moody
give
him
line
and
scope
Till
that
his
passions
like
a
whale
on
ground
Confound
themselves
with
working
Learn
this
Thomas
And
thou
shalt
prove
a
shelter
to
thy
friends
hoop
of
gold
to
bind
thy
brothers
in
That
the
united
vessel
of
their
blood
Mingled
with
venom
of
suggestion
As
force
perforce
the
age
will
pour
it
in
Shall
never
leak
though
it
do
work
as
strong
As
aconitum
or
rash
gunpowder
I
shall
observe
him
with
all
care
and
love
Why
art
thou
not
at
Windsor
with
him
Thomas
He
is
not
there
today
he
dines
in
London
And
how
accompanied
Canst
thou
tell
that
With
Poins
and
other
his
continual
followers
Most
subject
is
the
fattest
soil
to
weeds
And
he
the
noble
image
of
my
youth
Is
overspread
with
them
therefore
my
grief
Stretches
itself
beyond
the
hour
of
death
The
blood
weeps
from
my
heart
when
I
do
shape
In
forms
imaginary
thunguided
days
And
rotten
times
that
you
shall
look
upon
When
I
am
sleeping
with
my
ancestors
For
when
his
headstrong
riot
hath
no
curb
When
rage
and
hot
blood
are
his
counsellors
When
means
and
lavish
manners
meet
together
with
what
wings
shall
his
affections
fly
Towards
fronting
peril
and
opposd
decay
My
gracious
lord
you
look
beyond
him
quite
The
Prince
but
studies
his
companions
Like
a
strange
tongue
wherein
to
gain
the
language
Tis
needful
that
the
most
immodest
word
Be
lookd
upon
and
learnt
which
once
attaind
Your
Highness
knows
comes
to
no
further
use
But
to
be
known
and
hated
So
like
gross
terms
The
Prince
will
in
the
perfectness
of
time
Cast
off
his
followers
and
their
memory
Shall
as
a
pattern
or
a
measure
live
By
which
his
Grace
must
mete
the
lives
of
other
Turning
past
evils
to
advantages
Tis
seldom
when
the
bee
doth
leave
her
comb
In
the
dead
carrion
Enter
Whos
here
Westmoreland
Health
to
my
sovereign
and
new
happiness
Added
to
that
that
am
to
deliver
Prince
John
your
son
doth
kiss
your
Graces
hand
Mowbray
the
Bishop
Scroop
Hastings
and
all
Are
brought
to
the
correction
of
your
law
There
is
not
now
a
rebels
sword
unsheathd
But
Peace
puts
forth
her
olive
everywhere
The
manner
how
this
action
hath
been
borne
Here
at
more
leisure
may
your
Highness
read
With
every
course
in
his
particular
Westmoreland
thou
art
a
summer
bird
Which
ever
in
the
haunch
of
winter
sings
The
lifting
up
of
day
Enter
Look
heres
more
news
From
enemies
heaven
keep
your
Majesty
And
when
they
stand
against
you
may
they
fall
As
those
that
I
am
come
to
tell
you
of
The
Earl
Northumberland
and
the
Lord
Bardolph
With
a
great
power
of
English
and
of
Scots
Are
by
the
shrieve
of
Yorkshire
overthrown
The
manner
and
true
order
of
the
fight
This
packet
please
it
you
contains
at
large
And
wherefore
should
these
good
news
make
me
sick
Will
Fortune
never
come
with
both
hands
full
But
write
her
fair
words
still
in
foulest
letters
She
either
gives
a
stomach
and
no
food
Such
are
the
poor
in
health
or
else
a
feast
And
takes
away
the
stomach
such
are
the
rich
That
have
abundance
and
enjoy
it
not
I
should
rejoice
now
at
this
happy
news
And
now
my
sight
fails
and
my
brain
is
giddy
me
come
near
me
now
I
am
much
ill
Comfort
your
Majesty
my
royal
father
My
sovereign
lord
cheer
up
yourself
look
up
Be
patient
Princes
you
do
know
these
fits
Are
with
his
Highness
very
ordinary
Stand
from
him
give
him
air
hell
straight
be
well
No
no
he
cannot
long
hold
out
these
pangs
Th
incessant
care
and
labour
of
his
mind
Hath
wrought
the
mure
that
should
confine
it
in
So
thin
that
life
looks
through
and
will
break
out
The
people
fear
me
for
they
do
observe
Unfatherd
heirs
and
loathly
births
of
nature
The
seasons
change
their
manners
as
the
year
Had
found
some
months
asleep
and
leapt
them
over
The
river
hath
thrice
flowd
no
ebb
between
And
the
old
folk
Times
doting
chronicles
Say
it
did
so
a
little
time
before
That
our
great
grandsire
Edward
sickd
and
died
Speak
lower
Princes
for
the
King
recovers
This
apoplexy
will
certain
be
his
end
I
pray
you
take
me
up
and
bear
me
hence
Into
some
other
chamber
Softly
pray
How
now
my
Lord
Chief
Justice
whither
away
How
doth
the
King
Exceeding
well
his
cares
are
now
all
ended
I
hope
not
dead
Hes
walkd
the
way
of
nature
And
to
our
purposes
he
lives
no
more
I
would
his
Majesty
had
calld
me
with
him
The
service
that
I
truly
did
his
life
Hath
left
me
open
to
all
injuries
Indeed
I
think
the
young
king
loves
you
not
I
know
he
doth
not
and
do
arm
myself
To
welcome
the
condition
of
the
time
Which
cannot
look
more
hideously
upon
me
Than
I
have
drawn
it
in
my
fantasy
Enter
and
others
Here
comes
the
heavy
issue
of
dead
Harry
that
the
living
Harry
had
the
temper
Of
he
the
worst
of
these
three
gentlemen
How
many
nobles
then
should
hold
their
places
That
must
strike
sail
to
spirits
of
vile
sort
God
I
fear
all
will
be
overturnd
Good
morrow
cousin
Warwick
good
morrow
Good
morrow
cousin
We
meet
like
men
that
had
forgot
to
speak
We
do
remember
but
our
argument
Is
all
too
heavy
to
admit
much
talk
Well
peace
be
with
him
that
hath
made
us
heavy
Peace
be
with
us
lest
we
be
heavier
good
my
lord
you
have
lost
a
friend
indeed
And
I
dare
swear
you
borrow
not
that
face
Of
seeming
sorrow
it
is
sure
your
own
Though
no
man
be
assurd
what
grace
to
find
You
stand
in
coldest
expectation
I
am
the
sorrier
would
twere
otherwise
Well
you
must
now
speak
Sir
John
Falstaff
fair
Which
swims
against
your
stream
of
quality
Sweet
Princes
what
I
did
I
did
in
honour
Led
by
th
impartial
conduct
of
my
soul
And
never
shall
you
see
that
I
will
beg
ragged
and
forestalld
remission
If
truth
and
upright
innocency
fail
me
Ill
to
the
King
my
master
that
is
dead
And
tell
him
who
hath
sent
me
after
him
Here
comes
the
Prince
Enter
attended
Good
morrow
and
God
save
your
Majesty
This
new
and
gorgeous
garment
majesty
Sits
not
so
easy
on
me
as
you
think
Brothers
you
mix
your
sadness
with
some
fear
This
is
the
English
not
the
Turkish
court
Not
Amurath
an
Amurath
succeeds
But
Harry
Harry
Yet
be
sad
good
brothers
For
by
my
faith
it
very
well
becomes
you
Sorrow
so
royally
in
you
appears
That
I
will
deeply
put
the
fashion
on
And
wear
it
in
my
heart
Why
then
be
sad
But
entertain
no
more
of
it
good
brothers
Than
a
joint
burden
laid
upon
us
all
For
me
by
heaven
I
bid
you
be
assurd
Ill
be
your
father
and
your
brother
too
Let
me
but
bear
your
love
Ill
bear
your
cares
Yet
weep
that
Harrys
dead
and
so
will
I
But
Harry
lives
that
shall
convert
those
tears
By
number
into
hours
of
happiness
We
hope
no
otherwise
from
your
Majesty
You
all
look
strangely
on
me
and
you
most
You
are
I
think
assurd
I
love
you
not
I
am
assurd
if
I
be
measurd
rightly
Your
Majesty
hath
no
just
cause
to
hate
me
No
How
might
a
prince
of
my
great
hopes
forget
So
great
indignities
you
laid
upon
me
What
rate
rebuke
and
roughly
send
to
prison
Th
immediate
heir
of
England
Was
this
easy
May
this
be
washd
in
Lethe
and
forgotten
I
then
did
use
the
person
of
your
father
The
image
of
his
power
lay
then
in
me
And
in
th
administration
of
his
law
Whiles
I
was
busy
for
the
commonwealth
Your
Highness
pleased
to
forget
my
place
The
majesty
and
power
of
law
and
justice
The
image
of
the
King
whom
I
presented
And
struck
me
in
my
very
seat
of
judgment
Whereon
as
an
offender
to
your
father
I
gave
bold
way
to
my
authority
And
did
commit
you
If
the
deed
were
ill
Be
you
contented
wearing
now
the
garland
To
have
a
son
set
your
decrees
at
nought
To
pluck
down
justice
from
your
awful
bench
To
trip
the
course
of
law
and
blunt
the
sword
That
guards
the
peace
and
safety
of
your
person
Nay
more
to
spurn
at
your
most
royal
image
And
mock
your
workings
in
a
second
body
Question
your
royal
thoughts
make
the
case
yours
Be
now
the
father
and
propose
a
son
Hear
your
own
dignity
so
much
profand
See
your
most
dreadful
laws
so
loosely
slighted
Behold
yourself
so
by
a
son
disdaind
And
then
imagine
me
taking
your
part
And
in
your
power
soft
silencing
your
son
After
this
cold
considerance
sentence
me
And
as
you
are
a
king
speak
in
your
state
What
I
have
done
that
misbecame
my
place
My
person
or
my
lieges
sovereignty
You
are
right
Justice
and
you
weigh
this
well
Therefore
still
bear
the
balance
and
the
sword
And
I
do
wish
your
honours
may
increase
Till
you
do
live
to
see
a
son
of
mine
Offend
you
and
obey
you
as
I
did
So
shall
I
live
to
speak
my
fathers
words
Happy
am
I
that
have
a
man
so
bold
That
dares
do
justice
on
my
proper
son
And
not
less
happy
having
such
a
son
That
would
deliver
up
his
greatness
so
Into
the
hands
of
justice
You
did
commit
me
For
which
I
do
commit
into
your
hand
Th
unstained
sword
that
you
have
usd
to
bear
With
this
remembrance
that
you
use
the
same
With
the
like
bold
just
and
impartial
spirit
As
you
have
done
gainst
me
There
is
my
hand
You
shall
be
as
a
father
to
my
youth
My
voice
shall
sound
as
you
do
prompt
mine
ear
And
I
will
stoop
and
humble
my
intents
To
your
wellpractisd
wise
directions
And
Princes
all
believe
me
I
beseech
you
My
father
is
gone
wild
into
his
grave
For
in
his
tomb
lie
my
affections
And
with
his
spirits
sadly
I
survive
To
mock
the
expectation
of
the
world
To
frustrate
prophecies
and
to
raze
out
Rotten
opinion
who
hath
writ
me
down
After
my
seeming
The
tide
of
blood
in
me
Hath
proudly
flowd
in
vanity
till
now
Now
doth
it
turn
and
ebb
back
to
the
sea
Where
it
shall
mingle
with
the
state
of
floods
And
flow
henceforth
in
formal
majesty
Now
call
we
our
high
court
of
parliament
And
let
us
choose
such
limbs
of
noble
counsel
That
the
great
body
of
our
state
may
go
In
equal
rank
with
the
best
governd
nation
That
war
or
peace
or
both
at
once
may
be
As
things
acquainted
and
familiar
to
us
In
which
you
father
shall
have
foremost
hand
Our
coronation
done
we
will
accite
As
I
before
remembred
all
our
state
And
God
consigning
to
my
good
intents
No
prince
nor
peer
shall
have
just
cause
to
say
God
shorten
Harrys
happy
life

day
No

Very

Where

Lord
of
Canterbury
Not
here
in
presence
Send
for
him
good
uncle
Shall
we
call
in
th
ambassador
my
liege
Not
yet
my
cousin
we
would
be
resolvd
Before
we
hear
him
of
some
things
of
weight
That
task
our
thoughts
concerning
us
and
France
Enter
the
and
the
God
and
his
angels
guard
your
sacred
throne
And
make
you
long
become
it
Sure
we
thank
you
My
learned
lord
we
pray
you
to
proceed
And
justly
and
religiously
unfold
Why
the
law
Salique
that
they
have
in
France
Or
should
or
should
not
bar
us
in
our
claim
And
God
forbid
my
dear
and
faithful
lord
That
you
should
fashion
wrest
or
bow
your
reading
Or
nicely
charge
your
understanding
soul
With
opening
titles
miscreate
whose
right
Suits
not
in
native
colours
with
the
truth
For
God
doth
know
how
many
now
in
health
Shall
drop
their
blood
in
approbation
Of
what
your
reverence
shall
incite
us
to
Therefore
take
heed
how
you
impawn
our
person
How
you
awake
our
sleeping
sword
of
war
We
charge
you
in
the
name
of
God
take
heed
For
never
two
such
kingdoms
did
contend
Without
much
fall
of
blood
whose
guiltless
drops
Are
every
one
a
woe
a
sore
complaint
Gainst
him
whose
wrongs
gives
edge
unto
the
swords
That
makes
such
waste
in
brief
mortality
Under
this
conjuration
speak
my
lord
For
we
will
hear
note
and
believe
in
heart
That
what
you
speak
is
in
your
conscience
washd
As
pure
as
sin
with
baptism
Then
hear
me
gracious
sovereign
and
you
peers
That
owe
yourselves
your
lives
and
services
To
this
imperial
throne
There
is
no
bar
To
make
against
your
Highness
claim
to
France
But
this
which
they
produce
from
Pharamond
In
terram
Salicam
mulieres
ne
succedant
No
woman
shall
succeed
in
Salique
land
Which
Salique
land
the
French
unjustly
gloze
To
be
the
realm
of
France
and
Pharamond
The
founder
of
this
law
and
female
bar
Yet
their
own
authors
faithfully
affirm
That
the
land
Salique
is
in
Germany
Between
the
floods
of
Sala
and
of
Elbe
Where
Charles
the
Great
having
subdud
the
Saxons
There
left
behind
and
settled
certain
French
Who
holding
in
disdain
the
German
women
For
some
dishonest
manners
of
their
life
Establishd
then
this
law
to
wit
no
female
Should
be
inheritrix
in
Salique
land
Which
Salique
as
I
said
twixt
Elbe
and
Sala
Is
at
this
day
in
Germany
calld
Meisen
Then
doth
it
well
appear
the
Salique
law
Was
not
devised
for
the
realm
of
France
Nor
did
the
French
possess
the
Salique
land
Until
four
hundred
one
and
twenty
years
After
defunction
of
King
Pharamond
Idly
supposd
the
founder
of
this
law
Who
died
within
the
year
of
our
redemption
Four
hundred
twentysix
and
Charles
the
Great
Subdud
the
Saxons
and
did
seat
the
French
Beyond
the
river
Sala
in
the
year
Eight
hundred
five
Besides
their
writers
say
King
Pepin
which
deposed
Childeric
Did
as
heir
general
being
descended
Of
Blithild
which
was
daughter
to
King
Clothair
Make
claim
and
title
to
the
crown
of
France
Hugh
Capet
also
who
usurpd
the
crown
Of
Charles
the
Duke
of
Lorraine
sole
heir
male
Of
the
true
line
and
stock
of
Charles
the
Great
To
find
his
title
with
some
shows
of
truth
Though
in
pure
truth
it
was
corrupt
and
naught
Conveyd
himself
as
th
heir
to
th
Lady
Lingare
Daughter
to
Charlemain
who
was
the
son
To
Lewis
the
Emperor
and
Lewis
the
son
Of
Charles
the
Great
Also
King
Lewis
the
Tenth
Who
was
sole
heir
to
the
usurper
Capet
Could
not
keep
quiet
in
his
conscience
Wearing
the
crown
of
France
till
satisfied
That
fair
Queen
Isabel
his
grandmother
Was
lineal
of
the
Lady
Ermengare
Daughter
to
Charles
the
foresaid
Duke
of
Lorraine
By
the
which
marriage
the
line
of
Charles
the
Great
Was
reunited
to
the
Crown
of
France
So
that
as
clear
as
is
the
summers
sun
King
Pepins
title
and
Hugh
Capets
claim
King
Lewis
his
satisfaction
all
appear
To
hold
in
right
and
tide
of
the
female
So
do
the
kings
of
France
unto
this
day
Howbeit
they
would
hold
up
this
Salique
law
To
bar
your
Highness
claiming
from
the
female
And
rather
choose
to
hide
them
in
a
net
Than
amply
to
imbar
their
crooked
tides
Usurpd
from
you
and
your
progenitors
May
I
with
right
and
conscience
make
this
claim
The
sin
upon
my
head
dread
sovereign
For
in
the
book
of
Numbers
is
it
writ
When
the
man
dies
let
the
inheritance
Descend
unto
the
daughter
Gracious
lord
Stand
for
your
own
unwind
your
bloody
flag
Look
back
into
your
mighty
ancestors
Go
my
dread
lord
to
your
greatgrandsires
tomb
From
whom
you
claim
invoke
his
warlike
spirit
And
your
greatuncles
Edward
the
Black
Prince
Who
on
the
French
ground
playd
a
tragedy
Making
defeat
on
the
fun
power
of
France
Whiles
his
most
mighty
father
on
a
hill
Stood
smiling
to
behold
his
lions
whelp
Forage
in
blood
of
French
nobility
noble
English
that
could
entertain
With
half
their
forces
the
full
pride
of
France
And
let
another
half
stand
laughing
by
All
out
of
work
and
cold
for
action
Awake
remembrance
of
these
valiant
dead
And
with
your
puissant
arm
renew
their
feats
You
are
their
heir
you
sit
upon
their
throne
The
blood
and
courage
that
renowned
them
Runs
in
your
veins
and
my
thricepuissant
liege
Is
in
the
very
Maymorn
of
his
youth
Ripe
for
exploits
and
mighty
enterprises
Your
brother
kings
and
monarchs
of
the
earth
Do
all
expect
that
you
should
rouse
yourself
As
did
the
former
lions
of
your
blood
They
know
your
Grace
hath
cause
and
means
and
might
So
hath
your
Highness
never
King
of
England
Had
nobles
richer
and
more
loyal
subjects
Whose
hearts
have
left
their
bodies
here
in
England
And
lie
paviliond
in
the
fields
of
France
let
their
bodies
follow
my
dear
liege
With
blood
and
sword
and
fire
to
win
your
right
In
aid
whereof
we
of
the
spiritualty
Will
raise
your
Highness
such
a
mighty
sum
As
never
did
the
clergy
at
one
time
Bring
in
to
any
of
your
ancestors
We
must
not
only
arm
t
invade
the
French
But
lay
down
our
proportions
to
defend
Against
the
Scot
who
will
make
road
upon
us
With
all
advantages
They
of
those
marches
gracious
sovereign
Shall
be
a
wall
sufficient
to
defend
Our
inland
from
the
pilfering
borderers
We
do
not
mean
the
coursing
snatchers
only
But
fear
the
main
intendment
of
the
Scot
Who
hath
been
still
a
giddy
neighbour
to
us
For
you
shall
read
that
my
greatgrandfather
Never
went
with
his
forces
into
France
But
that
the
Scot
on
his
unfurnishd
kingdom
Came
pouring
like
the
tide
into
a
breach
With
ample
and
brim
fulness
of
his
force
Galling
the
gleaned
land
with
hot
assays
Girdling
with
grievous
siege
castles
and
towns
That
England
being
empty
of
defence
Hath
shook
and
trembled
at
th
ill
neighbourhood
She
hath
been
then
more
feard
than
harmd
my
liege
For
hear
her
but
exampled
by
herself
When
all
her
chivalry
hath
been
in
France
And
she
a
mourning
widow
of
her
nobles
She
hath
herself
not
only
well
defended
But
taken
and
impounded
as
a
stray
The
King
of
Scots
whom
she
did
send
to
France
To
fill
King
Edwards
fame
with
prisoner
kings
And
make
her
chronicle
as
rich
with
praise
As
is
the
ooze
and
bottom
of
the
sea
With
sunken
wreck
and
sumless
treasuries
But
theres
a
saying
very
old
and
true
If
that
you
will
France
win
Then
with
Scotland
first
begin
For
once
the
eagle
England
being
in
prey
To
her
unguarded
nest
the
weasel
Scot
Comes
sneaking
and
so
sucks
her
princely
eggs
Playing
the
mouse
in
absence
of
the
cat
To
tear
and
havoc
more
than
she
can
eat
It
follows
then
the
cat
must
stay
at
home
Yet
that
is
but
a
crushd
necessity
Since
we
have
locks
to
safeguard
necessaries
And
pretty
traps
to
catch
the
petty
thieves
While
that
the
armed
hand
doth
fight
abroad
Th
advised
head
defends
itself
at
home
For
government
though
high
and
low
and
lower
Put
into
parts
doth
keep
in
one
consent
Congreeing
in
a
full
and
natural
close
Like
music
Therefore
doth
heaven
divide
The
state
of
man
in
divers
functions
Setting
endeavour
in
continual
motion
To
which
is
fixed
as
an
aim
or
but
Obedience
for
so
work
the
honey
bees
Creatures
that
by
a
rule
in
nature
teach
The
act
of
order
to
a
peopled
kingdom
They
have
a
king
and
officers
of
sorts
Where
some
like
magistrates
correct
at
home
Others
like
merchants
venture
trade
abroad
Others
like
soldiers
armed
in
their
stings
Make
boot
upon
the
summers
velvet
buds
Which
pillage
they
with
merry
march
bring
home
To
the
tentroyal
of
their
emperor
Who
busied
in
his
majesty
surveys
The
singing
masons
building
roofs
of
gold
The
civil
citizens
kneading
up
the
honey
The
poor
mechanic
porters
crowding
in
Their
heavy
burdens
at
his
narrow
gate
The
sadeyd
justice
with
his
surly
hum
Delivering
oer
to
executors
pale
The
lazy
yawning
drone
I
this
infer
That
many
things
having
full
reference
To
one
consent
may
work
contrariously
As
many
arrows
loosed
several
ways
Come
to
one
mark
as
many
ways
meet
in
one
town
As
many
fresh
streams
meet
in
one
salt
sea
As
many
lines
close
in
the
dials
centre
So
many
a
thousand
actions
once
afoot
End
in
one
purpose
and
be
all
well
home
Without
defeat
Therefore
to
France
my
liege
Divide
your
happy
England
into
four
Whereof
take
you
one
quarter
into
France
And
you
withal
shall
make
all
Gallia
shake
If
we
with
thrice
such
powers
left
at
home
Cannot
defend
our
own
doors
from
the
dog
Let
us
be
worried
and
our
nation
lose
The
name
of
hardiness
and
policy
Call
in
the
messengers
sent
from
the
Dauphin
Now
are
we
well
resolvd
and
by
Gods
help
And
yours
the
noble
sinews
of
our
power
France
being
ours
well
bend
it
to
our
awe
Or
break
it
all
to
pieces
or
there
well
sit
Ruling
in
large
and
ample
empery
Oer
France
and
all
her
almost
kingly
dukedoms
Or
lay
these
bones
in
an
unworthy
urn
Tombless
with
no
remembrance
over
them
Either
our
history
shall
with
full
mouth
Speak
freely
of
our
acts
or
else
our
grave
Like
Turkish
mute
shall
have
a
tongueless
mouth
Not
worshippd
with
a
waxen
epitaph
Enter
of
France
Now
are
we
well
prepard
to
know
the
pleasure
Of
our
fair
cousin
Dauphin
for
we
hear
Your
greeting
is
from
him
not
from
the
King
Mayt
please
your
Majesty
to
give
us
leave
Freely
to
render
what
we
have
in
charge
Or
shall
we
sparingly
show
you
far
of
The
Dauphins
meaning
and
our
embassy
We
are
no
tyrant
but
a
Christian
king
Unto
whose
grace
our
passion
is
as
subject
As
are
our
wretches
fettred
in
our
prisons
Therefore
with
frank
and
with
uncurbed
plainness
Tell
us
the
Dauphins
mind
Thus
then
in
few
Your
Highness
lately
sending
into
France
Did
claim
some
certain
dukedoms
in
the
right
Of
your
great
predecessor
King
Edward
the
Third
In
answer
of
which
claim
the
Prince
our
master
Says
that
you
savour
too
much
of
your
youth
And
bids
you
be
advisd
theres
nought
in
France
That
can
be
with
a
nimble
galliard
won
You
cannot
revel
into
dukedoms
there
He
therefore
sends
you
meeter
for
your
spirit
This
tun
of
treasure
and
in
lieu
of
this
Desires
you
let
the
dukedoms
that
you
claim
Hear
no
more
of
you
This
the
Dauphin
speaks
What
treasure
uncle
Tennisballs
my
liege
We
are
glad
the
Dauphin
is
so
pleasant
with
us
His
present
and
your
pains
we
thank
you
for
When
we
have
matchd
our
rackets
to
these
balls
We
will
in
France
by
Gods
grace
play
a
set
Shall
strike
his
fathers
crown
into
the
hazard
Tell
him
he
hath
made
a
match
with
such
a
wrangler
That
all
the
courts
of
France
will
be
disturbd
With
chaces
And
we
understand
him
well
How
he
comes
oer
us
with
our
wilder
days
Not
measuring
what
use
we
made
of
them
We
never
valud
this
poor
seat
of
England
And
therefore
living
hence
did
give
ourself
To
barbarous
licence
as
tis
ever
common
That
men
are
merriest
when
they
are
from
home
But
tell
the
Dauphin
I
will
keep
my
state
Be
like
a
king
and
show
my
sail
of
greatness
When
I
do
rouse
me
in
my
throne
of
France
For
that
I
have
laid
by
my
majesty
And
plodded
like
a
man
for
workingdays
But
I
will
rise
there
with
so
full
a
glory
That
I
will
dazzle
all
the
eyes
of
France
Yea
strike
the
Dauphin
blind
to
look
on
us
And
tell
the
pleasant
Prince
this
mock
of
his
Hath
turnd
his
balls
to
gunstones
and
his
soul
Shall
stand
sore
charged
for
the
wasteful
vengeance
That
shall
fly
with
them
for
many
a
thousand
widows
Shall
this
his
mock
mock
of
their
dear
husbands
Mock
mothers
from
their
sons
mock
castles
down
And
some
are
yet
ungotten
and
unborn
That
shall
have
cause
to
curse
the
Dauphins
scorn
But
this
lies
all
within
the
will
of
God
To
whom
I
do
appeal
and
in
whose
name
Tell
you
the
Dauphin
I
am
coming
on
To
venge
me
as
I
may
and
to
put
forth
My
rightful
hand
in
a
wellhallowd
cause
So
get
you
hence
in
peace
and
tell
the
Dauphin
His
jest
will
savour
but
of
shallow
wit
When
thousands
weep
more
than
did
laugh
at
it
Convey
them
with
safe
conduct
Fare
you
well
This
was
a
merry
message
We
hope
to
make
the
sender
blush
at
it
Therefore
my
lords
omit
no
happy
hour
That
may
give
furthrance
to
our
expedition
For
we
have
now
no
thought
in
us
but
France
Save
those
to
God
that
run
before
our
business
Therefore
let
our
proportions
for
these
wars
Be
soon
collected
and
all
things
thought
upon
That
may
with
reasonable
swiftness
ad
More
feathers
to
our
wings
for
God
before
Well
chide
this
Dauphin
at
his
fathers
door
Therefore
let
every
man
now
task
his
thought
That
this
fair
action
may
on
foot
be
brought
Flourish
Enter
Now
all
the
youth
of
England
are
on
fire
And
silken
dalliance
in
the
wardrobe
lies
Now
thrive
the
armourers
and
honours
thought
Reigns
solely
in
the
breast
of
every
man
They
sell
the
pasture
now
to
buy
the
horse
Following
the
mirror
of
all
Christian
kings
With
winged
heels
as
English
Mercuries
For
now
sits
Expectation
in
the
air
And
hides
a
sword
from
hilts
unto
the
point
With
crowns
imperial
crowns
and
coronets
Promisd
to
Harry
and
his
followers
The
French
advisd
by
good
intelligence
Of
this
most
dreadful
preparation
Shake
in
their
fear
and
with
pale
policy
Seek
to
divert
the
English
purposes
England
model
to
thy
inward
greatness
Like
little
body
with
a
mighty
heart
What
mightst
thou
do
that
honour
would
thee
do
Were
all
thy
children
kind
and
natural
But
see
thy
fault
France
hath
in
thee
found
out
nest
of
hollow
bosoms
which
he
fills
With
treacherous
crowns
and
three
corrupted
men
One
Richard
Earl
of
Cambridge
and
the
second
Henry
Lord
Scroop
of
Masham
and
the
third
Sir
Thomas
Grey
knight
of
Northumberland
Have
for
the
gilt
of
France
guilt
indeed
Confirmd
conspiracy
with
fearful
France
And
by
their
hands
this
grace
of
kings
must
die
If
hell
and
treason
hold
their
promises
Ere
he
take
ship
for
France
and
in
Southampton
Linger
your
patience
on
and
well
digest
Th
abuse
of
distance
force
a
play
The
sum
is
paid
the
traitors
are
agreed
The
King
is
set
from
London
and
the
scene
Is
now
transported
gentles
to
Southampton
There
is
the
playhouse
now
there
must
you
sit
And
thence
to
France
shall
we
convey
you
safe
And
bring
you
back
charming
the
narrow
seas
To
give
you
gentle
pass
for
if
we
may
Well
not
offend
one
stomach
with
our
play
But
till
the
King
come
forth
and
not
till
then
Unto
Southampton
do
we
shift
our
scene
Fore
God
his
Grace
is
bold
to
trust
these
traitors
They
shall
be
apprehended
by
and
by
How
smooth
and
even
they
do
bear
themselves
As
if
allegiance
in
their
bosoms
sat
Crowned
with
faith
and
constant
loyalty
The
King
hath
note
of
all
that
they
intend
By
interception
which
they
dream
not
of
Nay
but
the
man
that
was
his
bedfellow
Whom
he
hath
dulld
and
cloyd
with
gracious
favours
That
he
should
for
a
foreign
purse
so
sell
His
sovereigns
life
to
death
and
treachery
Trumpets
sound
Enter
the
and
attendants
Now
sits
the
wind
fair
and
we
will
aboard
My
Lord
of
Cambridge
and
my
kind
Lord
of
Masham
And
you
my
gentle
knight
give
me
your
thoughts
Think
you
not
that
the
powrs
we
bear
with
us
Will
cut
their
passage
through
the
force
of
France
Doing
the
execution
and
the
act
For
which
we
have
in
head
assembled
them
No
doubt
my
liege
if
each
man
do
his
best
I
doubt
not
that
since
we
are
well
persuaded
We
carry
not
a
heart
with
us
from
hence
That
grows
not
in
a
fair
consent
with
ours
Nor
leave
not
one
behind
that
doth
not
wish
Success
and
conquest
to
attend
on
us
Never
was
monarch
better
feard
and
lovd
Than
is
your
Majesty
Theres
not
I
think
a
subject
That
sits
in
heartgrief
and
uneasines
Under
the
sweet
shade
of
your
government
True
those
that
were
your
fathers
enemies
Have
steepd
their
galls
in
honey
and
do
serve
you
With
hearts
create
of
duty
and
of
zeal
We
therefore
have
great
cause
of
thankfulness
And
shall
forget
the
office
of
our
hand
Sooner
than
quittance
of
desert
and
merit
According
to
the
weight
and
worthiness
So
service
shall
with
steeled
sinews
toil
And
labour
shall
refresh
itself
with
hope
To
do
your
Grace
incessant
services
We
judge
no
less
Uncle
of
Exeter
Enlarge
the
man
committed
yesterday
That
raild
against
our
person
We
consider
It
was
excess
of
wine
that
set
him
on
And
on
his
more
advice
we
pardon
him
Thats
mercy
but
too
much
security
Let
him
be
punishd
sovereign
lest
example
Breed
by
his
sufferance
more
of
such
a
kind
let
us
yet
be
merciful
So
may
your
Highness
and
yet
punish
too
Sir
You
show
great
mercy
if
you
give
him
life
After
the
taste
of
much
correction
Alas
your
too
much
love
and
care
of
me
Are
heavy
orisons
gainst
this
poor
wretch
If
little
faults
proceeding
on
distemper
Shall
not
be
winkd
at
how
shall
we
stretch
our
eye
When
capital
crimes
chewd
swallowd
and
digested
Appear
before
us
Well
yet
enlarge
that
man
Though
Cambridge
Scroop
and
Grey
in
their
dear
care
And
tender
preservation
of
our
person
Would
have
him
punishd
And
now
to
our
French
causes
Who
are
the
late
commissioners
I
one
my
lord
Your
Highness
bade
me
ask
for
it
today
So
did
you
me
my
liege
And
I
my
royal
sovereign
Then
Richard
Earl
of
Cambridge
there
is
yours
There
yours
Lord
Scroop
of
Masham
and
Sir
Knight
Grey
of
Northumberland
this
same
is
yours
Read
them
and
know
I
know
your
worthiness
My
Lord
of
Westmoreland
and
uncle
Exeter
We
will
aboard
tonight
Why
how
now
gentlemen
What
see
you
in
those
papers
that
you
lose
So
much
complexion
Look
ye
how
they
change
Their
cheeks
are
paper
Why
what
read
you
there
That
have
so
cowarded
and
chasd
your
blood
Out
of
appearance
I
do
confess
my
fault
And
do
submit
me
to
your
Highness
mercy
To
which
we
all
appeal
The
mercy
that
was
quick
in
us
but
late
By
your
own
counsel
is
suppressd
and
killd
You
must
not
dare
for
shame
to
talk
of
mercy
For
your
own
reasons
turn
into
your
bosoms
As
dogs
upon
their
masters
worrying
you
See
you
my
princes
and
my
noble
peers
These
English
monsters
My
Lord
of
Cambridge
here
You
know
how
apt
our
love
was
to
accord
To
furnish
him
with
an
appertinents
Belonging
to
his
honour
and
this
man
Hath
for
a
few
light
crowns
lightly
conspird
And
sworn
unto
the
practices
of
France
To
kill
us
here
in
Hampton
to
the
which
This
knight
no
less
for
bounty
bound
to
us
Than
Cambridge
is
hath
likewise
sworn
But
What
shall
I
say
to
thee
Lord
Scroop
thou
cruel
Ingrateful
savage
and
inhuman
creature
Thou
that
didst
bear
the
key
of
all
my
counsels
That
knewst
the
very
bottom
of
my
soul
That
almost
mightst
have
coind
me
into
gold
Wouldst
thou
have
practisd
on
me
for
thy
use
May
it
be
possible
that
foreign
hire
Could
out
of
thee
extract
one
spark
of
evil
That
might
annoy
my
finger
Tis
so
strange
That
though
the
truth
of
it
stands
off
as
gross
As
black
and
white
my
eye
will
scarcely
see
it
Treason
and
murder
ever
kept
together
As
two
yokedevils
sworn
to
eithers
purpose
Working
so
grossly
in
a
natural
cause
That
admiration
did
not
whoop
at
them
But
thou
gainst
all
proportion
didst
bring
in
Wonder
to
wait
on
treason
and
on
murder
And
whatsoever
cunning
fiend
it
was
That
wrought
upon
thee
so
preposterously
Hath
got
the
voice
in
hell
for
excellence
And
other
devils
that
suggest
by
treasons
Do
botch
and
bungle
up
damnation
With
patches
colours
and
with
forms
being
fetchd
From
glistring
semblances
of
piety
But
he
that
temperd
thee
bade
thee
stand
up
Gave
thee
no
instance
why
thou
shouldst
do
treason
Unless
to
dub
thee
with
the
name
of
traitor
If
that
same
demon
that
hath
gulld
thee
thus
Should
with
his
lion
gait
walk
the
whole
world
He
might
return
to
vasty
Tartar
back
And
tell
the
legions
I
can
never
win
soul
so
easy
as
that
Englishmans
how
hast
thou
with
jealousy
infected
The
sweetness
of
affiance
Show
men
dutiful
Why
so
didst
thou
Seem
they
grave
and
learned
Why
so
didst
thou
Come
they
of
noble
family
Why
so
didst
thou
Seem
they
religious
Why
so
didst
thou
Or
are
they
spare
in
diet
Free
from
gross
passion
or
of
mirth
or
anger
Constant
in
spirit
not
swerving
with
the
blood
Garnishd
and
deckd
in
modest
complement
Not
working
with
the
eye
without
the
ear
And
but
in
purged
judgment
trusting
neither
Such
and
so
finely
bolted
didst
thou
seem
And
thus
thy
fall
hath
left
a
kind
of
blot
To
mark
the
fullfraught
man
and
best
indued
With
some
suspicion
I
will
weep
for
thee
For
this
revolt
of
thine
methinks
is
like
Another
fall
of
man
Their
faults
are
open
Arrest
them
to
the
answer
of
the
law
And
God
acquit
them
of
their
practices
I
arrest
thee
of
high
treason
by
the
name
of
Richard
Earl
of
Cambridge
I
arrest
thee
of
high
treason
by
the
name
of
Henry
Lord
Scroop
of
Masham
I
arrest
thee
of
high
treason
by
the
name
of
Thomas
Grey
knight
of
Northumberland
Our
purposes
God
justly
hath
discoverd
And
I
repent
my
fault
more
than
my
death
Which
I
beseech
your
Highness
to
forgive
Although
my
body
pay
the
price
of
it
For
me
the
gold
of
France
did
not
seduce
Although
I
did
admit
it
as
a
motive
The
sooner
to
effect
what
I
intended
But
God
be
thanked
for
prevention
Which
I
in
sufferance
heartily
will
rejoice
Beseeching
God
and
you
to
pardon
me
Never
did
faithful
subject
more
rejoice
At
the
discovery
of
most
dangerous
treason
Than
I
do
at
this
hour
joy
oer
myself
Prevented
from
a
damned
enterprise
My
fault
but
not
my
body
pardon
sovereign
God
quit
you
in
his
mercy
Hear
your
sentence
You
have
conspird
against
our
royal
person
Joind
with
an
enemy
proclaimd
and
from
his
coffers
Receivd
the
golden
earnest
of
our
death
Wherein
you
would
have
sold
your
king
to
slaughter
His
princes
and
his
peers
to
servitude
His
subjects
to
oppression
and
contempt
And
his
whole
kingdom
into
desolation
Touching
our
person
seek
we
no
revenge
But
we
our
kingdoms
safety
must
so
tender
Whose
ruin
you
have
sought
that
to
her
laws
We
do
deliver
you
Get
you
therefore
hence
Poor
miserable
wretches
to
your
death
The
taste
whereof
God
of
his
mercy
give
You
patience
to
endure
and
true
repentance
Of
all
your
dear
offences
Bear
them
hence
Now
lords
for
France
the
enterprise
whereof
Shall
be
to
you
as
us
like
glorious
We
doubt
not
of
a
fair
and
lucky
war
Since
God
so
graciously
hath
brought
to
light
This
dangerous
treason
lurking
in
our
way
To
hinder
our
beginnings
we
doubt
not
now
But
every
rub
is
smoothed
on
our
way
Then
forth
dear
countrymen
let
us
deliver
Our
puissance
into
the
hand
of
God
Putting
it
straight
in
expedition
Cheerly
to
sea
the
signs
of
war
advance
No
king
of
England
if
not
king
of
France
Flourish
Thus
comes
the
English
with
full
power
upon
us
And
more
than
carefully
it
us
concerns
To
answer
royally
in
our
defences
Therefore
the
Dukes
of
Berri
and
of
Britaine
Of
Brabant
and
of
Orleans
shall
make
forth
And
you
Prince
Dauphin
with
all
swift
dispatch
To
line
and
new
repair
our
towns
of
war
With
men
of
courage
and
with
means
defendant
For
England
his
approaches
makes
as
fierce
As
waters
to
the
sucking
of
a
gulf
It
fits
us
then
to
be
as
provident
As
fear
may
teach
us
out
of
late
examples
Left
by
the
fatal
and
neglected
English
Upon
our
fields
My
most
redoubted
father
It
is
most
meet
we
arm
us
gainst
the
foe
For
peace
itself
should
not
so
dull
a
kingdom
Though
war
nor
no
known
quarrel
were
in
question
But
that
defences
musters
preparations
Should
be
maintaind
assembled
and
collected
As
were
a
war
in
expectation
Therefore
I
say
tis
meet
we
all
go
forth
To
view
the
sick
and
feeble
parts
of
France
And
let
us
do
it
with
no
show
of
fear
No
with
no
more
than
if
we
heard
that
England
Were
busied
with
a
Whitsun
morrisdance
For
my
good
liege
she
is
so
idly
kingd
Her
sceptre
so
fantastically
borne
By
a
vain
giddy
shallow
humorous
youth
That
fear
attends
her
not
peace
Prince
Dauphin
You
are
too
much
mistaken
in
this
king
Question
your
Grace
the
late
ambassadors
With
what
great
state
he
heard
their
embassy
How
well
supplied
with
noble
counsellors
How
modest
in
exception
and
withal
How
terrible
in
constant
resolution
And
you
shall
find
his
vanities
forespent
Were
but
the
outside
of
the
Roman
Brutus
Covering
discretion
with
a
coat
of
folly
As
gardeners
do
with
ordure
hide
those
roots
That
shall
first
spring
and
be
most
delicate
Well
tis
not
so
my
Lord
High
Constable
But
though
we
think
it
so
it
is
no
matter
In
cases
of
defence
tis
best
to
weigh
The
enemy
more
mighty
than
he
seems
So
the
proportions
of
defence
are
filld
Which
of
a
weak
and
niggardly
projection
Doth
like
a
miser
spoil
his
coat
with
scanting
little
cloth
Think
we
King
Harry
strong
And
Princes
look
you
strongly
arm
to
meet
him
The
kindred
of
him
hath
been
fleshd
upon
us
And
he
is
bred
out
of
that
bloody
strain
That
haunted
us
in
our
familiar
paths
Witness
our
too
much
memorable
shame
When
Cressy
battle
fatally
was
struck
And
all
our
princes
capdvd
by
the
hand
Of
that
black
name
Edward
Black
Prince
of
Wales
Whiles
that
his
mountain
sire
on
mountain
standing
Up
in
the
air
crownd
with
the
golden
sun
Saw
his
heroical
seed
and
smild
to
see
him
Mangle
the
work
of
nature
and
deface
The
patterns
that
by
God
and
by
French
fathers
Had
twenty
years
been
made
This
is
a
stern
Of
that
victorious
stock
and
let
us
fear
The
native
mightiness
and
fate
of
him
Enter
a
Ambassadors
from
Harry
King
of
England
Do
crave
admittance
to
your
Majesty
Well
give
them
present
audience
Go
and
bring
them
You
see
this
chase
is
hotly
followed
friends
Turn
head
and
stop
pursuit
for
coward
dogs
Most
spend
their
mouths
when
what
they
seem
to
threaten
Runs
far
before
them
Good
my
sovereign
Take
up
the
English
short
and
let
them
know
Of
what
a
monarchy
you
are
the
head
Selflove
my
liege
is
not
so
vile
a
sin
As
selfneglecting
Reenter
with
and
train
From
our
brother
of
England
From
him
and
thus
he
greets
your
Majesty
He
wills
you
in
the
name
of
God
Almighty
That
you
divest
yourself
and
lay
apart
The
borrowed
glories
that
by
gift
of
heaven
By
law
of
nature
and
of
nations
longs
To
him
and
to
his
heirs
namely
the
crown
And
all
widestretched
honours
that
pertain
By
custom
and
the
ordinance
of
times
Unto
the
crown
of
France
That
you
may
know
Tis
no
sinister
nor
no
awkward
claim
Pickd
from
the
wormholes
of
longvanishd
days
Nor
from
the
dust
of
old
oblivion
rakd
He
sends
you
this
most
memorable
line
Gives
a
paper
In
every
branch
truly
demonstrative
Willing
you
overlook
this
pedigree
And
when
you
find
him
evenly
derivd
From
his
most
famd
of
famous
ancestors
Edward
the
Third
he
bids
you
then
resign
Your
crown
and
kingdom
indirectly
held
From
him
the
native
and
true
challenger
Or
else
what
follows
Bloody
constraint
for
if
you
hide
the
crown
Even
in
your
hearts
there
will
he
rake
for
it
Therefore
in
fierce
tempest
is
he
coming
In
thunder
and
in
earthquake
like
a
Jove
That
if
requiring
fail
he
will
compel
And
bids
you
in
the
bowels
of
the
Lord
Deliver
up
the
crown
and
to
take
mercy
On
the
poor
souls
for
whom
this
hungry
war
Opens
his
vasty
jaws
and
on
your
head
Turning
the
widows
tears
the
orphans
cries
The
dead
mens
blood
the
privy
maidens
groans
For
husbands
fathers
and
betrothed
lovers
That
shall
be
swallowed
in
this
controversy
This
is
his
claim
his
threatning
and
my
message
Unless
the
Dauphin
be
in
presence
here
To
whom
expressly
I
bring
greeting
too
For
us
we
will
consider
of
this
further
Tomorrow
shall
you
bear
our
full
intent
Back
to
our
brother
of
England
For
the
Dauphin
I
stand
here
for
him
What
to
him
from
England
Scorn
and
defiance
slight
regard
contempt
And
anything
that
may
not
misbecome
The
mighty
sender
doth
he
prize
you
at
Thus
says
my
king
an
if
your
fathers
Highness
Do
not
in
grant
of
all
demands
at
large
Sweeten
the
bitter
mock
you
sent
his
Majesty
Hell
call
you
to
so
hot
an
answer
of
it
That
caves
and
womby
vaultages
of
France
Shall
chide
your
trespass
and
return
your
mock
In
second
accent
of
his
ordinance
Say
if
my
father
render
fair
return
It
is
against
my
will
for
I
desire
Nothing
but
odds
with
England
To
that
end
As
matching
to
his
youth
and
vanity
I
did
present
him
with
the
Paris
balls
Hell
make
your
Paris
Louvre
shake
for
it
Were
it
the
mistress
court
of
mighty
Europe
And
be
assurd
youll
find
a
difference
As
we
his
subjects
have
in
wonder
found
Between
the
promise
of
his
greener
days
And
these
he
masters
now
Now
he
weighs
time
Even
to
the
utmost
grain
that
you
shall
read
In
your
own
losses
if
he
stay
in
France
Tomorrow
shall
you
know
our
mind
at
full
Dispatch
us
with
all
speed
lest
that
our
king
Come
here
himself
to
question
our
delay
For
he
is
footed
in
this
land
already
You
shall
be
soon
dispatchd
with
fair
conditions
night
is
but
small
breath
and
little
pause
To
answer
matters
of
this
consequence
Flourish
Flourish
Enter
Thus
with
imagind
wing
our
swift
scene
flies
In
motion
of
no
less
celerity
Than
that
of
thought
Suppose
that
you
have
seen
The
wellappointed
King
at
Hampton
pier
Embark
his
royalty
and
his
brave
fleet
With
silken
streamers
the
young
Phorbus
fanning
Play
with
your
fancies
and
in
them
behold
Upon
the
hempen
tackle
shipboys
climbing
Hear
the
shrill
whistle
which
doth
order
give
To
sounds
confusd
behold
the
threaden
sails
Borne
with
th
invisible
and
creeping
wind
Draw
the
huge
bottoms
through
the
furrowed
sea
Breasting
the
lofty
surge
do
but
think
You
stand
upon
the
rivage
and
behold
city
on
th
inconstant
billows
dancing
For
so
appears
this
fleet
majestical
Holding
due
course
to
Harfleur
Follow
follow
Grapple
your
minds
to
sternage
of
this
navy
And
leave
your
England
as
dead
midnight
still
Guarded
with
grandsires
babies
and
old
women
Either
past
or
not
arrivd
to
pith
and
puissance
For
who
is
he
whose
chin
is
but
enrichd
With
one
appearing
hair
that
will
not
follow
These
culld
and
choicedrawn
cavaliers
to
France
Work
work
your
thoughts
and
therein
see
a
siege
Behold
the
ordnance
on
their
carriages
With
fatal
mouths
gaping
on
girded
Harfleur
Suppose
th
ambassador
from
the
French
comes
back
Tells
Harry
that
the
King
doth
offer
him
Katherine
his
daughter
and
with
her
to
dowry
Some
petty
and
unprofitable
dukedoms
The
offer
likes
not
and
the
nimble
gunner
With
linstock
now
the
devilish
cannon
touches
Alarum
and
chambers
go
off
And
down
goes
all
before
them
Still
be
kind
And
eke
out
our
performance
with
your
mind
On
on
on
on
on
to
the
breach
to
the
breach
Pray
thee
Corporal
stay
the
knocks
are
too
hot
and
for
mine
own
part
I
have
not
a
case
of
lives
The
humour
of
it
is
too
hot
that
is
the
very
plainsong
of
it
The
plainsong
is
most
just
for
humours
do
abound
Knocks
go
and
come
Gods
vassals
drop
and
die
And
sword
and
shield
In
bloody
field
Doth
win
immortal
fame
Would
I
were
in
an
alehouse
in
London
I
wouid
give
all
my
fame
for
a
pot
of
ale
and
safety
And
I
If
wishes
would
prevail
with
me
My
purpose
should
not
fail
with
me
But
thither
would
I
hie
As
duly
but
not
as
truly
As
bird
doth
sing
on
bough
Enter
Up
to
the
breach
you
dogs
Avaunt
you
cullions
Driving
them
forward
Be
merciful
great
duke
to
men
of
mould
Abate
thy
rage
abate
thy
manly
rage
Abate
thy
rage
great
duke
Good
bawcock
bate
thy
rage
Use
lenity
sweet
chuck
These
be
good
humours
Your
honour
wins
bad
humours
As
young
as
I
am
I
have
observd
these
three
swashers
I
am
boy
to
them
all
three
but
all
they
three
though
they
would
serve
me
could
not
be
man
to
me
for
indeed
three
such
antics
do
not
amount
to
a
man
For
Bardolph
he
is
whiteliverd
and
redfacd
by
the
means
whereof
a
faces
it
out
but
fights
not
For
Pistol
he
hath
a
killing
tongue
and
a
quiet
sword
by
the
means
whereof
a
breaks
words
and
keeps
whole
weapons
For
Nym
he
hath
heard
that
men
of
few
words
are
the
best
men
and
therefore
he
scorns
to
say
his
prayers
lest
a
should
be
thought
a
coward
but
his
few
bad
words
are
matchd
with
as
few
good
deeds
for
a
never
broke
any
mans
head
but
his
own
and
that
was
against
a
post
when
he
was
drunk
They
will
steal
anything
and
call
it
purchase
Bardolph
stole
a
lutecase
bore
it
twelve
leagues
and
sold
it
for
three
halfpence
Nym
and
Bardolph
are
sworn
brothers
in
filching
and
in
Calais
they
stole
a
fireshovel
I
knew
by
that
piece
of
service
the
men
would
carry
coals
They
would
have
me
as
familiar
with
mens
pockets
as
their
gloves
or
their
handkerchers
which
makes
much
against
my
manhood
if
I
should
take
from
anothers
pocket
to
put
into
mine
for
it
is
plain
pocketing
up
of
wrongs
I
must
leave
them
and
seek
some
better
service
their
villainy
goes
against
my
weak
stomach
and
therefore
I
must
cast
it
up
Reenter
following
Captain
Fluellen
you
must
come
presently
to
the
mines
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
would
speak
with
you
To
the
mines
Tell
you
the
Duke
it
is
not
so
good
to
come
to
the
mines
for
look
you
the
mines
is
not
according
to
the
disciplines
of
the
war
the
concavities
of
it
is
not
sufficient
For
look
you
th
athversary
you
may
discuss
unto
the
Duke
look
you
is
digt
himself
four
yard
under
the
countermines
by
Cheshu
I
think
a
will
plow
up
all
if
there
is
not
better
directions
The
Duke
of
Gloucester
to
whom
the
order
of
the
siege
is
given
is
altogether
directed
by
an
Irishman
a
very
vallant
gentleman
i
faith
It
is
Captain
Macmorris
is
it
not
I
think
it
be
By
Cheshu
he
is
an
ass
as
in
the
world
I
will
verify
as
much
in
his
beard
he
has
no
more
directions
in
the
true
disciplines
of
the
wars
look
you
of
the
Roman
disciplines
than
is
a
puppydog
Enter
and
Here
a
comes
and
the
Scots
captain
Captain
Jamy
with
him
Captain
Jamy
is
a
marvellous
falorous
gentleman
that
is
certain
and
of
great
expedition
and
knowledge
in
th
aunchient
wars
upon
my
particular
knowledge
of
his
directions
By
Cheshu
he
will
maintain
his
argument
as
well
as
any
military
man
in
the
world
in
the
disciplines
of
the
pristine
wars
of
the
Romans
I
say
gud
day
Captain
Fluellen
Godden
to
your
worship
good
Captain
James
How

Macmorris

Roman
wars
in
the
way
of
argument
look
you
and
friendly
communication
partly
to
satisfy
my
opinion
and
partly
for
the
satisfaction
look
you
of
my
mind
as
touching
the
direction
of
the
military
discipline
that
is
the
point
It

Marry

of

Of

Look

if
you
take
the
matter
otherwise

Captain
Macmorris

shall
think

with
that
affability
as
in
discretion
you
ought
to
use
me
look
you
being
as
good
a
man
as
yourself

particularities

How
now
Captain
Fluellen
Come
you
from
the
bridge
I
assure
you
there
is
very
excellent
services
committed
at
the
bridge
Is
the
Duke
of
Exeter
safe
The
Duke
of
Exeter
is
as
magnanimous
as
Agamemnon
and
a
man
that
I
love
and
honour
with
my
soul
and
my
heart
and
my
duty
and
my
live
and
my
living
and
my
uttermost
power
He
is
not
God
be
praised
and
blessed
any
hurt
in
the
world
but
keeps
the
bridge
most
valiantly
with
excellent
discipline
There
is
an
aunchient
Lieutenant
there
at
the
bridge
I
think
in
my
very
conscience
he
is
as
valiant
a
man
as
Mark
Antony
and
he
is
man
of
no
estimation
in
the
world
but
I
did
see
him
do
as
gallant
service
What
do
you
call
him
He
is
calld
Aunchient
Pistol
I
know
him
not
Enter
Here
is
the
man
Captain
I
thee
beseech
to
do
me
favours
The
Duke
of
Exeter
doth
love
thee
well
Ay
I
praise
God
and
I
have
merited
some
love
at
his
hands
Bardolph
a
soldier
firm
and
sound
of
heart
And
of
buxom
valour
hath
by
cruel
fate
And
giddy
Fortunes
furious
fickle
wheel
That
goddess
blind
That
stands
upon
the
rolling
restless
stone
By
your
patience
Aunchient
Pistol
Fortune
is
painted
blind
with
a
muffler
afore
her
eyes
to
signify
to
you
that
Fortune
is
blind
and
she
is
painted
also
with
a
wheel
to
signify
to
you
which
is
the
moral
of
it
that
she
is
turning
and
inconstant
and
mutability
and
variation
and
her
foot
look
you
is
fixed
upon
a
spherical
stone
which
rolls
and
rolls
and
rolls
In
good
truth
the
poet
makes
a
most
excellent
description
of
it
Fortune
is
an
excellent
moral
Fortune
is
Bardolphs
foe
and
frowns
on
him
For
he
hath
stoln
a
pax
and
hanged
must
a
be
damned
death
Let
gallows
gape
for
dog
let
man
go
free
And
let
not
hemp
his
windpipe
suffocate
But
Exeter
hath
given
the
doom
of
death
For
pax
of
little
price
Therefore
go
speak
the
Duke
will
hear
thy
voice
And
let
not
Bardolphs
vital
thread
be
cut
With
edge
of
penny
cord
and
vile
reproach
Speak
Captain
for
his
life
and
I
will
thee
requite
Aunchient
Pistol
I
do
partly
understand
your
meaning
Why
then
rejoice
therefore
Certainly
Aunchient
it
is
not
a
thing
to
rejoice
at
for
if
look
you
he
were
my
brother
I
would
desire
the
Duke
to
use
his
good
pleasure
and
put
him
to
execution
for
discipline
ought
to
be
used
Die
and
be
damnd
and
figo
for
thy
friendship
It
is
well
The
fig
of
Spain
Very
good
Why
this
is
an
arrant
counterfeit
rascal
I
remember
him
now
a
bawd
a
cutpurse
Ill
assure
you
a
uttred
as
prave
words
at
the
pridge
as
you
shall
see
in
a
summers
day
But
it
is
very
well
what
he
has
spoke
to
me
that
is
well
I
warrant
you
when
time
is
serve
Why
tis
a
gull
a
fool
a
rogue
that
now
and
then
goes
to
the
wars
to
grace
himself
at
his
return
into
London
under
the
form
of
a
soldier
And
such
fellows
are
perfect
in
the
great
commanders
names
and
they
will
learn
you
by
rote
where
services
were
done
at
such
and
such
a
sconce
at
such
a
breach
at
such
a
convoy
who
came
off
bravely
who
was
shot
who
disgracd
what
terms
the
enemy
stood
on
and
this
they
con
perfectly
in
the
phrase
of
war
which
they
trick
up
with
newtuned
oaths
and
what
a
beard
of
the
Generals
cut
and
a
horrid
suit
of
the
camp
will
do
among
foaming
bottles
and
alewashd
wits
is
wonderful
to
be
thought
on
But
you
must
learn
to
know
such
slanders
of
the
age
or
else
you
may
be
marvellously
mistook
I
tell
you
what
Captain
Gower
I
do
perceive
he
is
not
the
man
that
he
would
gladly
make
show
to
the
world
he
is
if
I
find
a
hole
in
his
coat
I
will
tell
him
my
mind
Drum
within
Hark
you
the
King
is
coming
and
I
must
speak
with
him
from
the
pridge
Drum
and
colours
Enter
the
and
his
poor
soldiers
and
God
pless
your
Majesty
How
now
Fluellen
Camst
thou
from
the
bridge
Ay
so
please
your
Majesty
The
Duke
of
Exeter
has
very
gallantly
maintaind
the
pridge
the
French
is
gone
off
look
you
and
there
is
gallant
and
most
prave
passages
Marry
th
athversary
was
have
possession
of
the
pridge
but
he
is
enforced
to
retire
and
the
Duke
of
Exeter
is
master
of
the
pridge
I
can
tell
your
Majesty
the
Duke
is
a
prave
man
What
men
have
you
lost
Fluellen
The
perdition
of
th
athversary
hath
been
very
great
reasonable
great
marry
for
my
part
I
think
the
Duke
hath
lost
never
a
man
but
one
that
is
like
to
be
executed
for
robbing
a
church
one
Bardolph
if
your
Majesty
know
the
man
his
face
is
all
bubukles
and
whelks
and
knobs
and
flames
o
fire
and
his
lips
blows
at
his
nose
and
it
is
like
a
coal
of
fire
sometimes
plue
and
sometimes
red
but
his
nose
is
executed
and
his
fires
out
We
would
have
all
such
offenders
so
cut
off
And
we
give
express
charge
that
in
our
marches
through
the
country
there
be
nothing
compelld
from
the
villages
nothing
taken
but
paid
for
none
of
the
French
upbraided
or
abused
in
disdainful
language
for
when
lenity
and
cruelty
play
for
a
kingdom
the
gentler
gamester
is
the
soonest
winner
Tucket
Enter
You
know
me
by
my
habit
Well
then
I
know
thee
what
shall
I
know
of
thee
My
masters
mind
Unfold
it
Thus
says
my
king
Say
thou
to
Harry
of
England
Though
we
seemd
dead
we
did
but
sleep
advantage
is
a
better
soldier
than
rashness
Tell
him
we
could
have
rebukd
him
at
Harfleur
but
that
we
thought
not
good
to
bruise
an
injury
till
it
were
full
ripe
Now
we
speak
upon
our
cue
and
our
voice
is
imperial
England
shall
repent
his
folly
see
his
weakness
and
admire
our
sufferance
Bid
him
therefore
consider
of
his
ransom
which
must
proportion
the
losses
we
have
borne
the
subjects
we
have
lost
the
disgrace
we
have
digested
which
in
weight
to
reanswer
his
pettiness
would
bow
under
For
our
losses
his
exchequer
is
too
poor
for
th
effusion
of
our
blood
the
muster
of
his
kingdom
too
faint
a
number
and
for
our
disgrace
his
own
person
kneeling
at
our
feet
but
a
weak
and
worthless
satisfaction
To
this
add
defiance
and
tell
him
for
conclusion
he
hath
betrayed
his
followers
whose
condemnation
is
pronouncd
So
far
my
king
and
master
so
much
my
office
What
is
thy
name
I
know
thy
quality
Montjoy
Thou
dost
thy
office
fairly
Turn
thee
back
And
tell
thy
king
I
do
not
seek
him
now
But
could
be
willing
to
march
on
to
Calais
Without
impeachment
for
to
say
the
sooth
Though
tis
no
wisdom
to
confess
so
much
Unto
an
enemy
of
craft
and
vantage
My
people
are
with
sickness
much
enfeebled
My
numbers
lessend
and
those
few
I
have
Almost
no
better
than
so
many
French
Who
when
they
were
in
health
I
tell
thee
herald
I
thought
upon
one
pair
of
English
legs
Did
march
three
Frenchmen
Yet
forgive
me
God
That
I
do
brag
thus
this
your
air
of
France
Hath
blown
that
vice
in
me
I
must
repent
Go
therefore
tell
thy
master
here
I
am
My
ransom
is
this
frail
and
worthless
trunk
My
army
but
a
weak
and
sickly
guard
Yet
God
before
tell
him
we
will
come
on
Though
France
himself
and
such
another
neighbour
Stand
in
our
way
Theres
for
thy
labour
Montjoy
Go
bid
thy
master
well
advise
himself
If
we
may
pass
we
will
if
we
be
hindred
We
shall
your
tawny
ground
with
your
red
blood
Discolour
and
so
Montjoy
fare
you
well
The
sum
of
all
our
answer
is
but
this
We
would
not
seek
a
battle
as
we
are
Nor
as
we
are
we
say
we
will
not
shun
it
So
tell
your
master
I
shall
deliver
so
Thanks
to
your
Highness
I
hope
they
will
not
come
upon
us
now
We
are
in
Gods
hand
brother
not
in
theirs
March
to
the
bridge
it
now
draws
toward
night
Beyond
the
river
well
encamp
ourselves
And
on
tomorrow
bid
them
march
away
Gloucester
tis
true
that
we
are
in
great
danger
The
greater
therefore
should
our
courage
be
Good
morrow
brother
Bedford
God
Almighty
There
is
some
soul
of
goodness
in
things
evil
Would
men
observingly
distil
it
out
For
our
bad
neighbour
makes
us
early
stirrers
Which
is
both
healthful
and
good
husbandry
Besides
they
are
our
outward
consciences
And
preachers
to
us
all
admonishing
That
we
should
dress
us
fairly
for
our
end
Thus
may
we
gather
honey
from
the
weed
And
make
a
moral
of
the
devil
himself
Enter
Good
morrow
old
Sir
Thomas
Erpingham
good
soft
pillow
for
that
good
white
head
Were
better
than
a
churlish
turf
of
France
Not
so
my
liege
this
lodging
likes
me
better
Since
I
may
say
Now
lie
I
like
a
king
Tis
good
for
men
to
love
their
present
pains
Upon
example
so
the
spirit
is
eased
And
when
the
mind
is
quickned
out
of
doubt
The
organs
though
defunct
and
dead
before
Break
up
their
drowsy
grave
and
newly
move
With
casted
slough
and
fresh
legerity
Lend
me
thy
cloak
Sir
Thomas
Brothers
both
Commend
me
to
the
princes
in
our
camp
Do
my
good
morrow
to
them
and
anon
Desire
them
all
to
my
pavilion
We
shall
my
liege
Shall
I
attend
your
Grace
No
my
good
knight
Go
with
my
brothers
to
my
lords
of
England
I
and
my
bosom
must
debate
awhile
And
then
I
would
no
other
company
The
Lord
in
heaven
bless
thee
noble
Harry
Godamercy
old
heart
thou
speakst
cheerfully
Enter
Qui

Discuss
unto
me
art
thou

Or
art
thou
base
common
and
popular
I
am
a
gentleman
of
a
company
Trailst
thou
the
puissant
pike
Even
so
What
are
you
As
good
a
gentleman
as
the
Emperor
Then
you
are
a
better
than
the
King
The
Kings
a
bawcock
and
a
heart
of
gold
lad
of
life
an
imp
of
fame
Of
parents
good
of
fist
most
valiant
I
kiss
his
dirty
shoe
and
from
heartstring
I
love
the
lovely
bully
What
is
thy
name
Harry
le
Roy
Le
Roy
a
Cornish
name
art
thou
of
Cornish
crew
No
I
am
a
Welshman
Knowst
thou
Fluellen
Yes
Tell
him
Ill
knock
his
leek
about
his
pate
Upon
Saint
Davys
day
Do
not
you
wear
your
dagger
in
your
cap
that
day
lest
he
knock
that
about
yours
Art
thou
his
friend
And
his
kinsman
too
The
figo
for
thee
then
I
thank
you
God
be
with
you
My
name
is
Pistol
calld
It
sorts
well
with
your
fierceness
Enter
and
Captain
Fluellen
So
in
the
name
of
Jesu
Christ
speak
fewer
It
is
the
greatest
admiration
in
the
universal
world
when
the
true
and
aunchient
prerogatifes
and
laws
of
the
wars
is
not
kept
if
you
would
take
the
pains
but
to
examine
the
wars
of
Pompey
the
Great
you
shall
find
I
warrant
you
that
there
is
no
tiddletaddle
nor
pibblepabble
in
Pompeys
camp
I
warrant
you
you
shall
find
the
ceremonies
of
the
wars
and
the
cares
of
it
and
the
forms
of
it
and
the
sobriety
of
it
and
the
modesty
of
it
to
be
otherwise
Why
the
enemy
is
loud
you
hear
him
all
night
If
the
enemy
is
an
ass
and
a
fool
and
a
prating
coxcomb
is
it
meet
think
you
that
we
should
also
look
you
be
an
ass
and
a
fool
and
a
prating
coxcomb
In
your
own
conscience
now
I
will
speak
lower
I
pray
you
and
beseech
you
that
you
will
Though
it
appear
a
little
out
of
fashion
There
is
much
care
and
valour
in
this
Welshman
Enter
three
soldiers
and
Brother
John
Bates
is
not
that
the
morning
which
breaks
yonder
I
think
it
be
but
we
have
no
great
cause
to
desire
the
approach
of
day
We
see
yonder
the
beginning
of
the
day
but
I
think
we
shall
never
see
the
end
of
it
Who
goes
there
friend
Under
what
captain
serve
you
Under
Sir
Thomas
Erpingham
good
old
commander
and
a
most
kind
gentleman
I
pray
you
what
thinks
he
of
our
estate
Even
as
men
wreckd
upon
a
sand
that
look
to
be
washd
off
the
next
tide
He
hath
not
told
his
thought
to
the
King
No
nor
it
is
not
meet
he
should
For
though
I
speak
it
to
you
I
think
the
King
is
but
a
man
as
I
am
the
violet
smells
to
him
as
it
doth
to
me
the
element
shows
to
him
as
it
doth
to
me
all
his
senses
have
but
human
conditions
his
ceremonies
laid
by
in
his
nakedness
he
appears
but
a
man
and
though
his
affections
are
higher
mounted
than
ours
yet
when
they
stoop
they
stoop
with
the
like
wing
Therefore
when
he
sees
reason
of
fears
as
we
do
his
fears
out
of
doubt
be
of
the
same
relish
as
ours
are
yet
in
reason
no
man
should
possess
him
with
any
appearance
of
fear
lest
he
by
showing
it
should
dishearten
his
army
He
may
show
what
outward
courage
he
will
but
I
believe
as
cold
a
night
as
tis
he
could
wish
himself
in
Thames
up
to
the
neck
and
so
I
would
he
were
and
I
by
him
at
all
adventures
so
we
were
quit
here
By
my
troth
I
will
speak
my
conscience
of
the
King
I
think
he
would
not
wish
himself
anywhere
but
where
he
is
Then
I
would
he
were
here
alone
so
should
he
be
sure
to
be
ransomed
and
a
many
poor
mens
lives
saved
I
dare
say
you
love
him
not
so
ill
to
wish
him
here
alone
howsoever
you
speak
this
to
feel
other
mens
minds
methinks
I
could
not
die
anywhere
so
contented
as
in
the
Kings
company
his
cause
being
just
and
his
quarrel
honourable
Thats
more
than
we
know
Ay
or
more
than
we
should
seek
after
for
we
know
enough
if
we
know
we
are
the
Kings
subjects
If
his
cause
be
wrong
our
obedience
to
the
King
wipes
the
crime
of
it
out
of
us
But
if
the
cause
be
not
good
the
King
himself
hath
a
heavy
reckoning
to
make
when
all
those
legs
and
arms
and
heads
choppd
off
in
a
battle
shall
join
together
at
the
latter
day
and
cry
all
We
died
at
such
a
place
some
swearing
some
crying
for
a
surgeon
some
upon
their
wives
left
poor
behind
them
some
upon
the
debts
they
owe
some
upon
their
children
rawly
left
I
am
afeard
there
are
few
die
well
that
die
in
a
battle
for
how
can
they
charitably
dispose
of
anything
when
blood
is
their
argument
Now
if
these
men
do
not
die
well
it
will
be
a
black
matter
for
the
King
that
led
them
to
it
who
to
disobey
were
against
all
proportion
of
subjection
So
if
a
son
that
is
by
his
father
sent
about
merchandise
do
sinfully
miscarry
upon
the
sea
the
imputation
of
his
wickedness
by
your
rule
should
be
imposed
upon
his
father
that
sent
him
or
if
a
servant
under
his
masters
command
transporting
a
sum
of
money
be
assailed
by
robbers
and
die
in
many
irreconcild
iniquities
you
may
call
the
business
of
the
master
the
author
of
the
servants
damnation
But
this
is
not
so
the
King
is
not
bound
to
answer
the
particular
endings
of
his
soldiers
the
father
of
his
son
nor
the
master
of
his
servant
for
they
purpose
not
their
death
when
they
purpose
their
services
Besides
there
is
no
king
be
his
cause
never
so
spotless
if
it
come
to
the
arbitrement
of
swords
can
try
it
out
with
all
unspotted
soldiers
some
peradventure
have
on
them
the
guilt
of
premeditated
and
contrived
murder
some
of
beguiling
virgins
with
the
broken
seals
of
perjury
some
making
the
wars
their
bulwark
that
have
before
gored
the
gentle
bosom
of
peace
with
pillage
and
robbery
Now
if
these
men
have
defeated
the
law
and
outrun
native
punishment
though
they
can
outstrip
men
they
have
no
wings
to
fly
from
God
war
is
His
beadle
war
is
His
vengeance
so
that
here
men
are
punishd
for
beforebreach
of
the
Kings
laws
in
now
the
Kings
quarrel
Where
they
feared
the
death
they
have
borne
life
away
and
where
they
would
be
safe
they
perish
Then
if
they
die
unprovided
no
more
is
the
King
guilty
of
their
damnation
than
he
was
before
guilty
of
those
impieties
for
the
which
they
are
now
visited
Every
subjects
duty
is
the
Kings
but
every
subjects
soul
is
his
own
Therefore
should
every
soldier
in
the
wars
do
as
every
sick
man
in
his
bed
wash
every
mote
out
of
his
conscience
and
dying
so
death
is
to
him
advantage
or
not
dying
the
time
was
blessedly
lost
wherein
such
preparation
was
gained
and
in
him
that
escapes
it
were
not
sin
to
think
that
making
God
so
free
an
offer
He
let
him
outlive
that
day
to
see
His
greatness
and
to
teach
others
how
they
should
prepare
Tis
certain
every
man
that
dies
ill
the
ill
upon
his
own
head
the
King
is
not
to
answer
for
it
I
do
not
desire
he
should
answer
for
me
and
yet
I
determine
to
fight
lustily
for
him
I
myself
heard
the
King
say
he
would
not
be
ransomd
Ay
he
said
so
to
make
us
fight
cheerfully
but
when
our
throats
are
cut
he
may
be
ransomd
and
we
neer
the
wiser
If
I
live
to
see
it
I
will
never
trust
his
word
after
You
pay
him
then
Thats
a
perilous
shot
out
of
an
eldergun
that
a
poor
and
a
private
displeasure
can
do
against
a
monarch
You
may
as
well
go
about
to
turn
the
sun
to
ice
with
fanning
in
his
face
with
a
peacocks
feather
Youll
never
trust
his
word
after
Come
tis
a
foolish
saying
Your
reproof
is
something
too
round
I
should
be
angry
with
you
if
the
time
were
convenient
Let
it
be
a
quarrel
between
us
if
you
live
I
embrace
it
How
shall
I
know
thee
again
Give
me
any
gage
of
thine
and
I
will
wear
it
in
my
bonnet
then
if
ever
thou
darst
acknowledge
it
I
will
make
it
my
quarrel
Heres
my
glove
give
me
another
of
thine
There
This
will
I
also
wear
in
my
cap
if
ever
thou
come
to
me
and
say
after
tomorrow
This
is
my
glove
by
this
hand
I
will
take
thee
a
box
on
the
ear
If
ever
I
live
to
see
it
I
will
challenge
it
Thou
darst
as
well
be
hangd
Well
I
will
do
it
though
I
take
thee
in
the
Kings
company
Keep
thy
word
Fare
thee
well
Be
friends
you
English
fools
be
friends
we
have
French
quarrels
enow
if
you
could
tell
how
to
reckon
Indeed
the
French
may
lay
twenty
French
crowns
to
one
they
will
beat
us
for
they
bear
them
on
their
shoulders
but
it
is
no
English
treason
to
cut
French
crowns
and
tomorrow
the
King
himself
will
be
a
clipper
Upon
the
King
Let
us
our
lives
our
souls
Our
debts
our
careful
wives
Our
children
and
our
sins
lay
on
the
King
We
must
bear
all
hard
condition
Twinborn
with
greatness
subject
to
the
breath
Of
every
fool
whose
sense
no
more
can
feel
But
his
own
wringing
What
infinite
hearts
ease
Must
kings
neglect
that
private
men
enjoy
And
what
have
kings
that
privates
have
not
too
Save
ceremony
save
general
ceremony
And
what
art
thou
thou
idol
Ceremony
What
kind
of
god
art
thou
that
sufferst
more
Of
mortal
griefs
than
do
thy
worshippers
What
are
thy
rents
What
are
thy
comingsin
Ceremony
show
me
but
thy
worth
What
is
thy
soul
of
adoration
Art
thou
aught
else
but
place
degree
and
form
Creating
awe
and
fear
in
other
men
Wherein
thou
art
less
happy
being
feard
Than
they
in
fearing
What
drinkst
thou
oft
instead
of
homage
sweet
But
poisond
flattery
be
sick
great
greatness
And
bid
thy
ceremony
give
thee
cure
Thinks
thou
the
fiery
fever
will
go
out
With
titles
blown
from
adulation
Will
it
give
place
to
flexure
and
low
bending
Canst
thou
when
thou
commandst
the
beggars
knee
Command
the
health
of
it
No
thou
proud
dream
That
playst
so
subtly
with
a
kings
repose
I
am
a
king
that
find
thee
and
I
know
Tis
not
the
balm
the
sceptre
and
the
ball
The
sword
the
mace
the
crown
imperial
The
intertissued
robe
of
gold
and
pearl
The
farced
tide
running
fore
the
king
The
throne
he
sits
on
nor
the
tide
of
pomp
That
beats
upon
the
high
shore
of
this
world
No
not
all
these
thrice
gorgeous
ceremony
Not
all
these
laid
in
bed
majestical
Can
sleep
so
soundly
as
the
wretched
slave
Who
with
a
body
filld
and
vacant
mind
Gets
him
to
rest
crammd
with
distressful
bread
Never
sees
horrid
night
the
child
of
hell
But
like
a
lackey
from
the
rise
to
set
Sweats
in
the
eye
of
Pheebus
and
all
night
Sleeps
in
Elysium
next
day
after
dawn
Doth
rise
and
help
Hyperion
to
his
horse
And
follows
so
the
everrunning
year
With
profitable
labour
to
his
grave
And
but
for
ceremony
such
a
wretch
Winding
up
days
with
toil
and
nights
with
sleep
Had
the
forehand
and
vantage
of
a
king
The
slave
a
member
of
the
countrys
peace
Enjoys
it
but
in
gross
brain
little
wots
What
watch
the
king
keeps
to
maintain
the
peace
Whose
hours
the
peasant
best
advantages
Enter
My
lord
your
nobles
jealous
of
your
absence
Seek
through
your
camp
to
find
you
Good
old
knight
Collect
them
all
together
at
my
tent
Ill
be
before
thee
I
shall
dot
my
lord
God
of
battles
steel
my
soldiers
hearts
Possess
them
not
with
fear
Take
from
them
now
The
sense
of
reckning
if
th
opposed
numbers
Pluck
their
hearts
from
them
Not
today
Lord
not
today
think
not
upon
the
fault
My
father
made
in
compassing
the
crown
I
Richards
body
have
interred
new
And
on
it
have
bestowed
more
contrite
tears
Than
from
it
issued
forced
drops
of
blood
Five
hundred
poor
I
have
in
yearly
pay
Who
twice
a
day
their
witherd
hands
hold
up
Toward
heaven
to
pardon
blood
and
I
have
built
Two
chantries
where
the
sad
and
solemn
priests
Sing
still
for
Richards
soul
More
will
I
do
Though
all
that
I
can
do
is
nothing
worth
Since
that
my
penitence
comes
after
all
Imploring
pardon
Enter
My
liege
My
brother
Gloucesters
voice
Ay
I
know
thy
errand
I
will
go
with
thee
The
day
my
friends
and
all
things
stay
for
me
and
Where
is
the
King
The
King
himself
is
rode
to
view
their
battle
Of
fighting
men
they
have
full
threescore
thousand
Theres
five
to
one
besides
they
all
are
fresh
Gods
arm
strike
with
us
tis
a
fearful
odds
God
bye
you
Princes
all
Ill
to
my
charge
If
we
no
more
meet
till
we
meet
in
heaven
Then
joyfully
my
noble
Lord
of
Bedford
My
dear
Lord
Gloucester
and
my
good
Lord
Exeter
And
my
kind
kinsman
warriors
all
adieu
Farewell
good
Salisbury
and
good
luck
go
with
thee
Farewell
kind
lord
Fight
valiantly
today
And
yet
I
do
thee
wrong
to
mind
thee
of
it
For
thou
art
framd
of
the
firm
truth
of
valour
He
is
as
full
of
valour
as
of
kindness
Princely
in
both
Enter
the
that
we
now
had
here
But
one
ten
thousand
of
those
men
in
England
That
do
no
work
today
Whats
he
that
wishes
so
My
cousin
Westmoreland
No
my
fair
cousin
If
we
are
markd
to
die
we
are
enow
To
do
our
country
loss
and
if
to
live
The
fewer
men
the
greater
share
of
honour
Gods
will
I
pray
thee
wish
not
one
man
more
By
Jove
I
am
not
covetous
for
gold
Nor
care
I
who
doth
feed
upon
my
cost
It
yearns
me
not
if
men
my
garments
wear
Such
outward
things
dwell
not
in
my
desires
But
if
it
be
a
sin
to
covet
honour
I
am
the
most
offending
soul
alive
No
faith
my
coz
wish
not
a
man
from
England
Gods
peace
I
would
not
lose
so
great
an
honour
As
one
man
more
methinks
would
share
from
me
For
the
best
hope
I
have
do
not
wish
one
more
Rather
proclaim
it
Westmoreland
through
my
host
That
he
which
hath
no
stomach
to
this
fight
Let
him
depart
his
passport
shall
be
made
And
crowns
for
convoy
put
into
his
purse
We
would
not
die
in
that
mans
company
That
fears
his
fellowship
to
die
with
us
This
day
is
calld
the
feast
of
Crispian
He
that
outlives
this
day
and
comes
safe
home
Will
stand
a
tiptoe
when
this
day
is
namd
And
rouse
him
at
the
name
of
Crispian
He
that
shall
live
this
day
and
see
old
age
Will
yearly
on
the
vigil
feast
his
neighbours
And
say
Tomorrow
is
Saint
Crispian
Then
will
he
strip
his
sleeve
and
show
his
scars
And
say
These
wounds
I
had
on
Crispians
day
Old
men
forget
yet
all
shall
be
forgot
But
hell
remember
with
advantages
What
feats
he
did
that
day
Then
shall
our
names
Familiar
in
his
mouth
as
household
words
Harry
the
King
Bedford
and
Exeter
Warwick
and
Talbot
Salisbury
and
Gloucester
Be
in
their
flowing
cups
freshly
remembred
This
story
shall
the
good
man
teach
his
son
And
Crispin
Crispian
shall
neer
go
by
From
this
day
to
the
ending
of
the
world
But
we
in
it
shall
be
remembered
We
few
we
happy
few
we
band
of
brothers
For
he
today
that
sheds
his
blood
with
me
Shall
be
my
brother
be
he
neer
so
vile
This
day
shall
gentle
his
condition
And
gentlemen
in
England
nowabed
Shall
think
themselves
accursd
they
were
not
here
And
hold
their
manhoods
cheap
whiles
any
speaks
That
fought
with
us
upon
Saint
Crispins
day
Reenter
My
sovereign
lord
bestow
yourself
with
speed
The
French
are
bravely
in
their
battles
set
And
will
with
all
expedience
charge
on
us
All
things
are
ready
if
our
minds
be
so
Perish
the
man
whose
mind
is
backward
now
Thou
dost
not
wish
more
help
from
England
coz
Gods
will
my
liege
would
you
and
I
alone
Without
more
help
could
fight
this
royal
battle
Why
now
thou
hast
unwishd
five
thousand
men
Which
likes
me
better
than
to
wish
us
one
You
know
your
places
God
be
with
you
all
Tucket
Enter
Once
more
I
come
to
know
of
thee
King
Harry
If
for
thy
ransom
thou
wilt
now
compound
Before
thy
most
assured
overthrow
For
certainly
thou
art
so
near
the
gulf
Thou
needs
must
be
englutted
Besides
in
mercy
The
constable
desires
thee
thou
wilt
mind
Thy
followers
of
repentance
that
their
souls
May
make
a
peaceful
and
a
sweet
retire
From
off
these
fields
where
wretches
their
poor
bodies
Must
lie
and
fester
Who
hath
sent
thee
now
The
Constable
of
France
I
pray
thee
bear
my
former
answer
back
Bid
them
achieve
me
and
then
sell
my
bones
Good
God
why
should
they
mock
poor
fellows
thus
The
man
that
once
did
sell
the
lions
skin
While
the
beast
livd
was
killd
with
hunting
him
many
of
our
bodies
shall
no
doubt
Find
native
graves
upon
the
which
I
trust
Shall
witness
live
in
brass
of
this
days
work
And
those
that
leave
their
valiant
bones
in
France
Dying
like
men
though
buried
in
your
dunghills
They
shall
be
famd
for
there
the
sun
shall
greet
them
And
draw
their
honours
reeking
up
to
heaven
Leaving
their
earthly
parts
to
choke
your
clime
The
smell
whereof
shall
breed
a
plague
in
France
Mark
then
abounding
valour
in
our
English
That
being
dead
like
to
the
bullets
grazing
Break
out
into
a
second
course
of
mischief
Killing
in
relapse
of
mortality
Let
me
speak
proudly
tell
the
Constable
We
are
but
warriors
for
the
workingday
Our
gayness
and
our
gilt
are
all
besmirchd
With
rainy
marching
in
the
painful
field
Theres
not
a
piece
of
feather
in
our
host
Good
argument
I
hope
we
will
not
fly
And
time
hath
worn
us
into
slovenry
But
by
the
mass
our
hearts
are
in
the
trim
And
my
poor
soldiers
tell
me
yet
ere
night
Theyll
be
in
fresher
robes
or
they
will
pluck
The
gay
new
coats
oer
the
French
soldiers
heads
And
turn
them
out
of
service
If
they
do
this
As
if
God
please
they
shall
my
ransom
then
Will
soon
be
levied
Herald
save
thou
thy
labour
Come
thou
no
more
for
ransom
gentle
herald
They
shall
have
none
I
swear
but
these
my
joints
Which
if
they
have
as
I
will
leave
em
them
Shall
yield
them
little
tell
the
Constable
I
shall
King
Harry
And
so
fare
thee
well
Thou
never
shalt
hear
herald
any
more
I
fear
thou
wilt
once
more
come
again
for
a
ransom
Enter
the
My
lord
most
humbly
on
my
knee
I
beg
The
leading
of
the
vaward
Take
it
brave
York
Now
soldiers
march
away
And
how
thou
pleasest
God
dispose
the
day
diable
Seigneur
le
jour
est
perdu
tout
est
perdu
Mort
Dieu
ma
vie
all
is
confounded
all
Reproach
and
everlasting
shame
Sits
mocking
in
our
plumes
short
alarum
mechante
fortune
Do
not
run
away
Why
an
our
ranks
are
broke
perdurable
shame
Lets
stab
ourselves
Be
these
the
wretches
that
we
playd
at
dice
for
Is
this
the
king
we
sent
to
for
his
ransom
Shame
and
eternal
shame
nothing
but
shame
Let
us
die
in
honour
once
more
back
again
And
he
that
will
not
follow
Bourbon
now
Let
him
go
hence
and
with
his
cap
in
hand
Like
a
base
pander
hold
the
chamberdoor
Whilst
by
a
slave
no
gender
than
my
dog
His
fairest
daughter
is
contaminated
Disorder
that
hath
spoild
us
friend
us
now
Let
us
on
heaps
go
offer
up
our
lives
We
are
enow
yet
living
in
the
field
To
smother
up
the
English
in
our
throngs
If
any
order
might
be
thought
upon
The
devil
take
order
now
Ill
to
the
throng
Let
life
be
short
else
shame
will
be
too
long
Kill
the
poys
and
the
luggage
Tis
expressly
against
the
law
of
arms
tis
as
arrant
a
piece
of
knavery
mark
you
now
as
can
be
offert
in
your
conscience
now
is
it
not
Tis
certain
theres
not
a
boy
left
alive
and
the
cowardly
rascals
that
ran
from
the
battle
ha
done
this
slaughter
besides
they
have
burned
and
carried
away
all
that
was
in
the
Kings
tent
wherefore
the
King
most
worthily
hath
causd
every
soldier
to
cut
his
prisoners
throat
tis
a
gallant
King
Ay

What

you
the
towns
name
where
Alexander
the
Pig
was
born
Alexander
the
Great
Why
I
pray

not
pig
great
The
pig
or
great
or
the
mighty
or
the
huge
or
the
magnanimous
are
all
one
reckonings
save
the
phrase
is
a
little
variations
I
think
Alexander
the
Great
was
born
in
Macedon
his
father
was
called
Philip
of
Macedon
as
I
take
it
I
think
it

in
Macedon
where
Alexander
is
porn
I
tell
you
Captain
if
you
look
in
the
maps
of
the
orld
I
warrant
you
sall
find
in
the
comparisons
between
Macedon
and
Monmouth
that
the
situations
look
you
is
both
alike
There
is
a
river
in
Macedon
and
there
is
also
moreover
a
river
at
Monmouth
it
is
calld
Wye
at
Monmouth
but
it
is
out
of
my
prains
what

the
name
of
the
other
river
but
tis
all
one
tis
alike
as
my
fingers
is

there
is
salmons
in
both
If
you
mark
Alexanders
life
well
Harry
of
Monmouths
life
is
come
after
it
indifferent
well
for
there
is
figures
in
all
things
Alexander
God
knows
and
you
know
in
his
rages
and
his
furies
and
his
wraths
and
his
cholers
and
his
moods
and
his
displeasures
and
his
indignations
and
also
being
a
little
intoxicates
in
his
prains
did
in
his
ales
and
his
angers
look
you
kill
his
best
friend
Cleitus
Our
king
is
not
like
him
in
that
he
never
killd
any
of
his
friends
It
is
not
well
done
mark
you
now
to
take
the
tales
out
of
my
mouth
ere
it
is
made
and
finished
I
speak
but
in
the
figures
and
comparisons
of
it
as
Alexander
killd
his
friend
Cleitus
being
in
his
ales
and
his
cups
so
also
Harry
Monmouth
being
in
his
right
wits
and
his
good
judgments
turnd
away
the
fat
knight
with
the
great
belly
doublet
he
was
full
of
jests

yond
hill
If
they

bid
them
come
down
Or
void

field
they
do
offend
our
sight
If
theyll
do
neither
we
will
come
to
them
And
make
them
skirr
away
as
swift
as
stones
Enforced
from
the
old
Assyrian
slings
Besides
well
cut
the
throats
of
those

And
not
a

of

Shall

Go

To

them
To
sort
our
nobles
from
our
common
men
For
many
of
our
princes
woe
the
while
Lie
drownd
and
soakd
in
mercenary
blood
So
do
our
vulgar
drench
their
peasant
limbs
In
blood
of
princes
and
their
wounded
steeds
Fret
fetlock
deep
in
gore
and
with
wild
rage
Yerk
out
their
armed
heels
at
their
dead
masters
Killing
them
twice
give
us
leave
great
King
To
view
the
field
in
safety
and
dispose
Of
their
dead
bodies
I
tell

truly
herald

For

That

King
Henry
the
Fifth
too
famous
to
live

England
neer
lost
a
king
of
so
much
worth
England
neer
had
a
king
until
his
time
Virtue
he
had
deserving
to
command
His
brandishd
sword
did
blind
men
with
his
beams
His
arms
spread
wider
than
a
dragons
wings
His
sparkling
eyes
replete
with
wrathful
fire
More
dazzled
and
drove
back
his
enemies
Than
midday
sun
fierce
bent
against

What

I

His
deeds
exceed

He
neer

We
mourn
in

why
mourn
we
not
in

Henry

dead
and
never

revive
Upon
a
wooden
coffin
we
attend
And
deaths
dishonourable
victory
We
with
our
stately
presence
glorify
Like
captives
bound
to
a
triumphant
car
What
shall
we
curse
the
planets
of
mishap
That
plotted
thus
our

overthrow
Or
shall
we
think
the
subtlewitted
French
Conjurers
and
sorcerers
that
afraid
of
him
By
magic
verses
have
contrivd
his
end
He
was

King

Unto

So
dreadful
will
not
be
as
was
his
sight
The
battles
of
the
Lord
of
Hosts
he
fought
The
Churchs
prayers
made
him
so
prosperous
The
Church
Where

Had
not

prayd
His
thread
of
life

None

Instead

Is
Rouen

up
If
Henry
were
recalld
to
life
again
These
news
would
cause
him
once
more
yield
the
ghost
How
were
they
lost
What
treachery
was
usd
No
treachery
but
want
of
men
and
money
Amongst
the
soldiers
this
is
muttered
That
here
you
maintain
several
factions
And
whilst
a
field
should
be
dispatchd
and
fought
You
are
disputing
of
your
generals
One
would
have
lingring
wars
with
little
cost
Another
would
fly
swift
but
wanteth
wings
third
thinks
without
expense
at

By
guileful
fair

Me

Regent
I

Give
me
my

Ill
fight
for
France
Away
with
these
disgraceful
wailing

Wounds
will
I
lend
the
French
instead
of

To

their

miseries
Enter

Lords

these
letters
full
of
bad
mischance
France
is
revolted
from

Except
some

We

Bedford

Ill

Gloucester
why

of

An

I

in
my

Wherewith
already
France
is
overrun
Enter
a
third
My
gracious
lords
to
add
to
your
laments
Wherewith
you
now
bedew
King
Henrys
hearse
I
must
inform
you
of
a
dismal
fight
Betwixt
the
stout
Lord
Talbot
and
the
French
What
Wherein
Talbot
overcame
Ist
so
no
wherein
Lord
Talbot
was
oerthrown
The
circumstance
Ill
tell
you
more
at
large
The
tenth
of
August
last
this
dreadful
lord
Retiring
from
the
siege
of
Orleans
Having
full
scarce
six
thousand
in
his
troop
By
three
and
twenty
thousand
of
the
French
Was
round
encompassed
and
set
upon
No
leisure
had
he
to
enrank
his
men
He
wanted
pikes
to
set
before
his
archers
Instead
whereof
sharp
stakes
pluckd
out
of
hedges
They
pitched
in
the
ground
confusedly
To
keep
the
horsemen
off
from
breaking
in
More
than
three
hours
the
fight
continued
Where
valiant
Talbot
above
human
thought
Enacted
wonders
with
his
sword
and
lance
Hundreds
he
sent
to
hell
and
none
durst
stand
him
Here
there
and
everywhere
enragd
he
slew
The
French
exclaimd
the
devil
was
in
arms
All
the
whole
army
stood
agazd
on
him
His
soldiers
spying
his
undaunted
spirit
Talbot
a
Talbot
cried
out
amain
And
rushd
into
the
bowels
of
the
battle
Here
had
the
conquest
fully
been
seald
up
If
Sir
John
Fastolfe
had
not
playd
the
coward
He
being
in
the
vaward
placd
behind
With
purpose
to
relieve
and
follow
them
Cowardly
fled
not
having
struck
one
stroke
Hence
grew
the
general
wreck
and
massacre
Enclosed
were
they
with
their
enemies
base
Walloon
to
win
the
Dauphins
grace
Thrust
Talbot
with
a
spear
into
the
back
Whom
all
France
with
their
chief
assembled
strength
Durst
not
presume
to
look
once
in
the
face
Is
Talbot
slain
Then
I
will
slay
myself
For
living
idly
here
in
pomp
and
ease
Whilst
such
a
worthy
leader
wanting
aid
Unto
his
dastard
foemen
is
betrayd
no
he
lives
but
is
took
prisoner
And
Lord
Scales
with
him
and
Lord
Hungerford
Most
of
the
rest
slaughterd
or
took
likewise
His
ransom
there
is
none
but
I
shall
pay
Ill
hale
the
Dauphin
headlong
from
his
throne
His
crown
shall
be
the
ransom
of
my
friend
Four
of
their
lords
Ill
change
for
one
of
ours
Farewell
my
masters
to
my
task
will
I
Bonfires
in
France
forthwith
I
am
to
make
To
keep
our
great
Saint
Georges
feast
withal
Ten
thousand
soldiers
with
me
I
will
take
Whose
bloody
deeds
shall
make
an
Europe
quake
So
you
had
need
for
Orleans
is
besiegd
The
English
army
is
grown
weak
and
faint
The
Earl
of
Salisbury
craveth
supply
And
hardly
keeps
his
men
from
mutiny
Since
they
so
few
watch
such
a
multitude
Remember
lords
your
oaths
to
Henry
sworn
Either
to
quell
the
Dauphin
utterly
Or
bring
him
in
obedience
to
your
yoke
I
do
remember
it
and
here
take
my
leave
To
go
about
my
preparation
Ill
to
the
Tower
with
all
the
haste
I
can
To
view
th
artillery
and
munition
And
then
I
will
proclaim
young
Henry
king
To
Eltham
will
I
where
the
young
King
is
Being
ordaind
his
special
governor
And
for
his
safety
there
Ill
best
devise
Aside
Each
hath
his
place
and
function
to
attend
I
am
left
out
for
me
nothing
remains
But
long
I
will
not
be
Jack
out
of
office
The
King
from
Eltham
I
intend
to
steal
And
sit
at
chiefest
stern
of
public
weal
France
Before
Orleans
Sound
a
flourish
Enter
and
marching
with
drum
and
soldiers
Mars
his
true
moving
even
as
in
the
heavens
So
in
the
earth
to
this
day
is
not
known
Late
did
he
shine
upon
the
English
side
Now
we
are
victors
upon
us
he
smiles
What
towns
of
any
moment
but
we
have
At
pleasure
here
we
lie
near
Orleans
Otherwhiles
the
famishd
English
like
pale
ghosts
Faintly
besiege
us
one
hour
in
a
month
They
want
their
porridge
and
their
fat
bull
beeves
Either
they
must
be
dieted
like
mules
And
have
their
provender
tied
to
their
mouths
Or
piteous
they
will
look
like
drowned
mice
Lets
raise
the
siege
Why
live
we
idly
here
Talbot
is
taken
whom
we
wont
to
fear
Remaineth
none
but
madbraind
Salisbury
And
he
may
well
in
fretting
spend
his
gall
Nor
men
nor
money
hath
he
to
make
war
Sound
sound
alarum
we
will
rush
on
them
Now
for
the
honour
of
the
forlorn
French
Him
I
forgive
my
death
that
killeth
me
When
he
sees
me
go
back
one
foot
or
flee
Here
alarum
They
are
beaten
hack
by
the
English
with
great
loss
Reenter
and
Who
ever
saw
the
like
What
men
have
I
Dogs
cowards
dastards
I
would
neer
have
fled
But
that
they
left
me
midst
my
enemies
Salisbury
is
a
desperate
homicide
He
fighteth
as
one
weary
of
his
life
The
other
lords
like
lions
wanting
food
Do
rush
upon
us
as
their
hungry
prey
Froissart
a
countryman
of
ours
records
England
all
Olivers
and
Rowlands
bred
During
the
time
Edward
the
Third
did
reign
More
truly
now
may
this
be
verified
For
none
but
Samsons
and
Goliases
It
sendeth
forth
to
skirmish
One
to
ten
Lean
rawbond
rascals
Who
would
eer
suppose
They
had
such
courage
and
audacity
Lets
leave
this
town
for
they
are
harebraind
slaves
And
hunger
will
enforce
them
to
be
more
eager
Of
old
I
know
them
rather
with
their
teeth
The
walls
theyll
tear
down
than
forsake
the
siege
I
think
by
some
odd
gimmers
or
device
Their
arms
are
set
like
clocks
still
to
strike
on
Else
neer
could
they
hold
out
so
as
they
do
By
my
consent
well
even
let
them
alone
Be
it
so
Enter
the
Wheres

Prince
Dauphin

Which

a
vision
sent
to
her
from
heaven
Ordained
is
to
raise
this
tedious
siege
And
drive
the
English
forth
the
bounds
of
France
The
spirit
of
deep
prophecy
she
hath
Exceeding
the
nine
sibyls
of
old
Rome
Whats
past
and
whats
to
come
she
can
descry
Speak

I
call
her
in
Believe
my
words
For
they
are
certain
and
unfallible
Go
call
her
in
But
first
to
try
her
skill
Reignier
stand
thou
as
Dauphin
in
my
place
Question
her
proudly
let
thy
looks
be
stern
By
this
means
shall
we
sound
what
skill
she
hath
Reenter

Fair

wilt
do
these
wondrous
feats
Reignier

that
thinkest
to
beguile
me
Where

the
Dauphin
Come

from
behind
I
know
thee
well
though
never
seen
before
Be
not
amazd
theres
nothing
hid
from
me
In
private
will
I
talk
with
thee
apart
Stand
back
you
lords
and
give
us
leave
awhile
She
takes
upon
her
bravely
at
first
dash
Dauphin
I
am
by
birth
a
shepherds
daughter
My
wit
untraind
in
any
kind
of
art
Heaven
and
our
Lady
gracious
hath
it
pleasd
To
shine
on
my
contemptible
estate
Lo
whilst
I
waited
on
my
tender
lambs
And
to
suns
parching
heat
displayd
my
cheeks
Gods
Mother
deigned
to
appear
to
me
And
in
a
vision
full
of
majesty
Willd
me
to
leave
my
base
vocation
And
free
my
country
from
calamity
Her
aid
she
promisd
and
assurd
success
In
complete
glory
she
reveald
herself
And
whereas
I
was
black
and
swart
before
With
those
clear
rays
which
she
infusd
on
me
That
beauty
am
I
blessd
with
which
you
may
see
Ask
me
what
question
thou
canst
possible
And
I
will
answer
unpremeditated
My
courage
try
by
combat
if
thou
darst
And
thou
shalt
find
that
I
exceed
my
sex
Resolve
on
this
thou
shalt
be
fortunate
If
thou
receive
me
for
thy
warlike
mate
Thou
hast
astonishd
me
with
thy
high
terms
Only
this
proof
Ill
of
thy
valour
make
In
single
combat
thou
shalt
buckle
with
me
And
if
thou
vanquishest
thy
words
are
true
Otherwise
I
renounce
all
confidence
I
am
prepard
here
is
my
keenedgd
sword
Deckd
with
five
flowerdeluces
on
each
side
The
which
at
Touraine
in
Saint
Katherines
churchyard
Out
of
a
great
deal
of
old
iron
I
chose
forth
Then
come
o
Gods
name
I
fear
no
woman
And
while
I
live
Ill
neer
fly
from
a
man
Here
they
fight
and
overcomes
Stay
stay
thy
hands
thou
art
an
Amazon
And
fightest
with
the
sword
of
Deborah
Christs
Mother
helps
me
else
I
were
too
weak
Whoeer
helps
thee
tis
thou
that
must
help
me
Impatiently
I
burn
with
thy
desire
My
heart
and
hands
thou
hast
at
once
subdud
Excellent
Pucelle
if
thy
name
be
so
Let
me
thy
servant
and
not
sovereign
be
Tis
the
French
Dauphin
sueth
to
thee
thus
I
must
not
yield
to
any
rites
of
love
For
my
professions
sacred
from
above
When
I
have
chased
all
thy
foes
from
hence
Then
will
I
think
upon
a
recompense
Meantime
look
gracious
on
thy
prostrate
thrall
My
lord
methinks
is
very
long
in
talk
Doubtless
he
shrives
this
woman
to
her
smock
Else
neer
could
he
so
long
protract
his
speech
Shall
we
disturb
him
since
he
keeps
no
mean
He
may
mean
more
than
we
poor
men
do
know
These
women
are
shrewd
tempters
with
their
tongues
My
lord
where
are
you
What
devise
you
on
Shall
we
give
oer
Orleans
or
no
Why
no
I
say
distrustful
recreants
Fight
till
the
last
gasp
I
will
be
your
guard
What
she
says
Ill
confirm
well
fight
it
out
Assignd
am
I
to
be
the
English
scourge
This
night
the
siege
assuredly
Ill
raise
Expect
Saint
Martins
summer
halcyon
days
Since
I
have
entered
into
these
wars
Glory
is
like
a
circle
in
the
water
Which
never
ceaseth
to
enlarge
itself
Till
by
broad
spreading
it
disperse
to
nought
With
Henrys
death
the
English
circle
ends
Dispersed
are
the
glories
it
included
Now
am
I
like
that
proud
insulting
ship
Which
Caesar
and
his
fortune
bare
at
once
Was
Mahomet
inspired
with
a
dove
Thou
with
an
eagle
art
inspired
then
Helen
the
mother
of
great
Constantine
Nor
yet
Saint
Philips
daughters
were
like
thee
Bright
star
of
Venus
falln
down
on
the
earth
How
may
I
reverently
worship
thee
enough
Leave
off
delays
and
let
us
raise
the
siege
Woman
do
what
thou
canst
to
save
our
honours
Drive
them
from
Orleans
and
be
immortalizd
Presently
well
try
Come
lets

about
it
No
prophet
will
I
trust
if
she
prove
false

To

Prince
I
Will

thee
with

blows
Here

But

For

Good

year
France
Before
Orleans
Enter
on
the
walls

Sirrah
thou
knowst
how
Orleans
is
besiegd
And
how
the
English
have
the
suburbs
won
Father
I
know
and
oft
have
shot
at
them
Howeer
unfortunate
I
missd
my
aim
But
now
thou
shalt
not
Be
thou
ruld
by
me
Chief
mastergunner
am
I
of
this
town
Something
I
must
do
to
procure
me
grace
The
Princes
espials
have
informed
me
How
the
English
in
the
suburbs
close
intrenchd
Wont
through
a
secret
grate
of
iron
bars
In
yonder
tower
to
overpeer
the
city
And
thence
discover
how
with
most
advantage
They
may
vex
us
with
shot
or
with
assault
To
intercept
this
inconvenience
piece
of
ordnance
gainst
it
I
have
placd
And
even
these
three
days
have
I
watchd
If
I
could
see
them
Now
do
thou
watch
For
I
can
stay
no
longer
If
thou
spyst
any
run
and
bring
me
word
And
thou
shalt
find
me
at
the
Governors
Father
I
warrant
you
take
you
no
care
Ill
never
trouble
you
if
I
may
spy
them
Enter
and
on
the
turrets
with
and
others
Talbot
my
life
my
joy
again
returnd
How
wert
thou
handled
being
prisoner
Or
by
what
means
gotst
thou
to
be
releasd
Discourse
I
prithee
on
this
turrets
top
The
Earl
of
Bedford
had
a
prisoner
Calld
the
brave
Lord
Ponton
de
Santrailles
For
him
was
I
exchangd
and
ransomed
But
with
a
baser
man
of
arms
by
far
Once
in
contempt
they
would
have
barterd
me
Which
I
disdaining
scornd
and
craved
death
Rather
than
I
would
be
so
vile
esteemd
In
fine
redeemd
I
was
as
I
desird
But
the
treacherous
Fastolfe
wounds
my
heart
Whom
with
my
bare
fists
I
would
execute
If
I
now
had
him
brought
into
my
power
Yet
tellst
thou
not
how
thou
wert
entertaind
With
scoffs
and
scorns
and
contumelious
taunts
In
open
marketplace
producd
they
me
To
be
a
public
spectacle
to
all
Here
said
they
is
the
terror
of
the
French
The
scarecrow
that
affrights
our
children
so
Then
broke
I
from
the
officers
that
led
me
And
with
my
nails
diggd
stones
out
of
the
ground
To
hurl
at
the
beholders
of
my
shame
My
grisly
countenance
made
others
fly
None
durst
come
near
for
fear
of
sudden
death
In
iron
walls
they
deemd
me
not
secure
So
great
fear
of
my
name
mongst
them
was
spread
That
they
supposd
I
could
rend
bars
of
steel
And
spurn
in
pieces
posts
of
adamant
Wherefore
a
guard
of
chosen
shot
I
had
That
walkd
about
me
every
minutewhile
And
if
I
did
but
stir
out
of
my
bed
Ready
they
were
to
shoot
me
to
the
heart
Enter
the
with
a
linstock
I
grieve
to
hear
what
torments
you
endurd
But
we
will
be
revengd
sufficiently
Now
it
is
suppertime
in
Orleans
Here
through
this
grate
I
count
each
one
And
view
the
Frenchmen
how
they
fortify
Let
us
look
in
the
sight
will
much
delight
thee
Sir
Thomas
Gargrave
and
Sir
William
Glansdale
Let
me
have
your
express
opinions
Where
is
best
place
to
make
our
battry
next
I
think
at
the
North
Gate
for
there
stand
lords
And
I
here
at
the
bulwark
of
the
bridge
For
aught
I
see
this
city
must
be
famishd
Or
with
light
skirmishes
enfeebled
Here
they
shoot
and
and
fall
down
Lord
have
mercy
on
us
wretched
sinners
Lord
have
mercy
on
me
woeful
man
What
chance
is
this
that
suddenly
hath
crossd
us
Speak
Salisbury
at
least
if
thou
canst
speak
How
farst
thou
mirror
of
all
martial
men
One
of
thy
eyes
and
thy
cheeks
side
struck
off
Accursed
tower
accursed
fatal
hand
That
hath
contrivd
this
woeful
tragedy
In
thirteen
battles
Salisbury
oercame
Henry
the
Fifth
he
first
traind
to
the
wars
Whilst
any
trump
did
sound
or
drum
struck
up
His
sword
did
neer
leave
striking
in
the
field
Yet
livst
thou
Salisbury
Though
thy
speech
doth
fail
One
eye
thou
hast
to
look
to
heaven
for
grace
The
sun
with
one
eye
vieweth
all
the
world
Heaven
be
thou
gracious
to
none
alive
If
Salisbury
wants
mercy
at
thy
hands
Bear
hence
his
body
I
will
help
to
bury
it
Sir
Thomas
Gargrave
hast
thou
any
life
Speak
unto
Talbot
nay
look
up
to
him
Salisbury
cheer
thy
spirit
with
this
comfort
Thou
shalt
not
die
whiles
He
beckons
with
his
hand
and
smiles
on
me
As
who
should
say
When
I
am
dead
and
gone
Remember
to
avenge
me
on
the
French
Plantagenet
I
will
and
like
thee
Nero
Play
on
the
lute
beholding
the
towns
burn
Wretched
shall
France
be
only
in
my
name
Here
an
alarum
and
it
thunders
and
lightens
What
stir
is
this
What
tumults
in
the
heavens
Whence
cometh
this
alarum
and
the
noise
Enter
a
My
lord
my
lord
the
French
have
gatherd
head
The
Dauphin
with
one
Joan
la
Pucelle
joind
holy
prophetess
new
risen
up
Is
come
with
a
great
power
to
raise
the
siege
Here
lifteth
himself
up
and
groans
Hear

how
dying
Salisbury
doth
groan
It
irks
his
heart
he
cannot
be
revengd
Frenchmen
Ill
be
a
Salisbury

you
Pucelle
or
puzzel
dolphin
or
dogfish
Your
hearts
Ill
stamp
out
with
my
horses
heels
And
make
a
quagmire
of
your
mingled
brains
Convey
me
Salisbury
into
his
tent
And
then
well
try
what
these
dastard
Frenchmen
dare
Alarum
Before
Orleans
Here
an
alarum
again
and
pursueth
the
and
driveth
him
Then
enter
driving
Englishmen
before
her
Then
enter
Where
is
my
strength
my
valour
and
my
force
Our
English
troops
retire
I
cannot
stay
them
woman
clad
in
armour
chaseth
them
Enter
Here
here
she
comes
Ill
have
a
bout
with
thee
Devil
or
devils
dam
Ill
conjure
thee
Blood
will
I
draw
on
theethou

a
witch
And
straightway
give
thy
soul
to
him
thou
servst
Come
come
tis
only
I
that
must
disgrace
thee
Here
they
fight
Heavens
can
you
suffer
hell
so
to
prevail
My
breast
Ill
burst
with
straining
of
my
courage
And
from
my
shoulders
crack
my
arms
asunder
But
I
will
chastise
this
high
minded
strumpet
They
fight
again
Talbot
farewell
thy
hour
is
not
yet
come
I
must
go
victual
Orleans
forthwith
short
alarum
then
enter
the
town
with
soldiers
Oertake
me
if
thou
canst
I
scorn
thy
strength
Go
go
cheer
up
thy
hungry
starved
men
Help
Salisbury
to
make
his
testament
This
day
is
ours
as
many
more
shall
be
My
thoughts
are
whirled
like
a
potters
wheel
I
know
not
where
I
am
nor
what
I
do
witch
by
fear
not
force
like
Hannibal
Drives
back
our
troops
and
conquers
as
she
lists
So
bees
with
smoke
and
doves
with
noisome
stench
Are
from
their
hives
and
houses
driven
away
They
calld
us
for
our
fierceness
English
dogs
Now
like
to
whelps
we
crying
run
away
short
alarum
Hark
countrymen
Either
renew
the
fight
Or
tear
the
lions
out
of
Englands
coat
Renounce
your
soil
give
sheep
in
lions
stead
Sheep
run
not
half
so
treacherous
from
the
wolf
Or
horse
or
oxen
from
the
leopard
As
you
fly
from
your
oft
subdued
slaves
Alarum
Here
another
skirmish
It
will
not
beretire
into
your
trenches
You
all
consented
unto
Salisburys
death
For
none
would
strike
a
stroke
in
his
revenge
Pucelle
is
entred
into
Orleans
In
spite
of
us
or
aught
that
we
could
do
would
I
were
to
die
with
Salisbury
The
shame
hereof
will
make
me
hide
my
head
Flourish
Enter
on
the
walls
and
soldiers
Advance
our
waving
colours
on
the
walls
Rescud
is
Orleans
from
the
English
Thus
Joan
la
Pucelle
hath
performd
her
word
Divinest
creature
Astraeas
daughter
How
shall
I
honour
thee
for
this
success
Thy
promises
are
like
Adonis
gardens
That
one
day
bloomd
and
fruitful
were
the
next
France
triumph
in
thy
glorious
prophetess
Recoverd
is
the
town
of
Orleans
More
blessed
hap
did
neer
befall
our
state
Why
ring
not
out
the
bells
aloud
throughout
the
town
Dauphin
command
the
citizens
make
bonfires
And
feast
and
banquet
in
the
open
streets
To
celebrate
the
joy
that
God
hath
given
us
All
France
will
be
replete
with
mirth
and
joy
When
they
shall
hear
how
we
have
playd
the
men
Tis
Joan
not
we
by
whom
the
day
is
won
For
which
I
will
divide
my
crown
with
her
And
all
the
priests
and
friars
in
my
realm
Shall
in
procession
sing
her
endless
praise
statelier
pyramis
to
her
Ill
rear
Than
Rhodopes
of
Memphis
ever
was
In
memory
of
her
when
she
is
dead
Her
ashes
in
an
urn
more
precious
Than
the
rich
jeweld
coffer
of
Darius
Transported
shall
be
at
high
festivals
Before
the
kings
and
queens
of
France
No
longer
on
Saint
Denis
will
we
cry
But
Joan
la
Pucelle
shall
be
Frances
saint
Come
in
and
let
us
banquet
royally
After
this
golden
day
of
victory
Flourish
Before
Orleans
Enter
a
and
two
Sirs
take
your
places
and
be
vigilant
If
any
noise
or
soldier
you
perceive
Near
to
the
walls
by
some
apparent
sign
Let
us
have
knowledge
at
the
court
of
guard
Sergeant
you
shall
Thus
are
poor
servitors
When
others
sleep
upon
their
quiet
beds
Constraind
to
watch
in
darkness
rain
and
cold
Enter
and
forces
with
scalingladders
their
drums
beating
a
dead
march
Lord
Regent
and
redoubted
Burgundy
By
whose
approach
the
regions
of
Artois
Wallon
and
Picardy
are
friends
to
us
This
happy
night
the
Frenchmen
are
secure
Having
all
day
carousd
and
banqueted
Embrace
we
then
this
opportunity
As
fitting
best
to
quittance
their
deceit
Contrivd
by
art
and
baleful
sorcery
Coward
of
France
how
much
he
wrongs
his
fame
Despairing
of
his
own
arms
fortitude
To
join
with
witches
and
the
help
of
hell
Traitors
have
never
other
company
But
whats
that
Pucelle
whom
they
term
so
pure
maid
they
say
maid
and
be
so
martial
Pray
God
she
prove
not
masculine
ere
long
If
underneath
the
standard
of
the
French
She
carry
armour
as
she
hath
begun
Well
let
them
practise
and
converse
with
spirits
God
is
our
fortress
in
whose
conquering
name
Let
us
resolve
to
scale
their
flinty
bulwarks
Ascend
brave
Talbot
we
will
follow
thee
Not
all
together
better
far
I
guess
That
we
do
make
our
entrance
several
ways
That
if
it
chance
the
one
of
us
do
fail
The
other
yet
may
rise
against
their
force
Agreed
Ill
to
yond
corner
And
I
to
this
And
here
will
Talbot
mount
or
make
his
grave
Now
Salisbury
for
thee
and
for
the
right
Of
English
Henry
shall
this
night
appear
How
much
in
duty
I
am
bound
to
both
The
English
scale
the
walls
and
cry
Saint
George
a
Talbot
Arm
arm
The
enemy
doth
make
assault
The
French
leap
oer
the
walls
in
their
shirts
Enter
several
ways
half
ready
and
half
unready
How
now
my
lords
What
all
unready
so
Unready
Ay
and
glad
we
scapd
so
well
Twas
time
I
trow
to
wake
and
leave
our
beds
Hearing
alarums
at
our
chamber
doors
Of
all
exploits
since
first
I
followd
arms
Neer
heard
I
of
a
warlike
enterprise
More
venturous
or
desperate
than
this
I
think
this
Talbot
be
a
fiend
of
hell
If
not
of
hell
the
heavens
sure
favour
him
Here
cometh
Charles
I
marvel
how
he
sped
Enter
and
Tut
holy
Joan
was
his
defensive
guard
Is
this
thy
cunning
thou
deceitful
dame
Didst
thou
at
first
to
flatter
us
withal
Make
us
partakers
of
a
little
gain
That
now
our
loss
might
be
ten
times
so
much
Wherefore
is
Charles
impatient
with
his
friend
At
all
times
will
you
have
my
power
alike
Sleeping
or
waking
must
I
still
prevail
Or
will
you
blame
and
lay
the
fault
on
me
Improvident
soldiers
Had
your
watch
been
good
This
sudden
mischief
never
could
have
falln
Duke
of
Alencon
this
was
your
default
That
being
captain
of
the
watch
tonight
Did
look
no
better
to
that
weighty
charge
Had
all
your
quarters
been
as
safely
kept
As
that
whereof
I
had
the
government
We
had
not
been
thus
shamefully
surprisd
Mine
was
secure
And
so
was
mine
my
lord
And
for
myself
most
part
of
all
this
night
Within
her
quarter
and
mine
own
precinct
I
was
employd
in
passing
to
and
fro
About
relieving
of
the
sentinels
Then
how
or
which
way
should
they
first
break
in
Question
my
lords
no
further
of
the
case
How
or
which
way
tis
sure
they
found
some
place
But
weakly
guarded
where
the
breach
was
made
And
now
there
rests
no
other
shift
but
this
To
gather
our
soldiers
scatterd
and
dispersd
And
lay
new
platforms
to
endamage
them
Alarum
Enter
an
crying
Talbot
Talbot
They
fly
leaving
their
clothes
behind
Ill
be
so
bold
to
take
what
they
have
left
The
cry
of
Talbot
serves
me
for
a
sword
For
I
have
loaden
me
with
many
spoils
Using
no
other
weapon
but
his
name
Within
the
town
Enter
a
and
others
The
day
begins
to
break
and
night
is
fled
Whose
pitchy
mantle
overveild
the
earth
Here
sound
retreat
and
cease
our
hot
pursuit
Retreat
sounded
Bring
forth
the
body
of
old
Salisbury
And
here
advance
it
in
the
marketplace
The
middle
centre
of
this
cursed
town
Now
have
I
paid
my
vow
unto
his
soul
For
every
drop
of
blood
was
drawn
from
him
There
hath
at
least
five
Frenchmen
died
tonight
And
that
hereafter
ages
may
behold
What
ruin
happened
in
revenge
of
him
Within
their
chiefest
temple
Ill
erect
tomb
wherein
his
corpse
shall
be
interrd
Upon
the
which
that
every
one
may
read
Shall
be
engravd
the
sack
of
Orleans
The
treacherous
manner
of
his
mournful
death
And
what
a
terror
he
had
been
to
France
But
lords
in
all
our
bloody
massacre
I
muse
we
met
not
with
the
Dauphins
grace
His
newcome
champion
virtuous
Joan
of
Arc
Nor
any
of
his
false
confederates
Tis
thought
Lord
Talbot
when
the
fight
began
Rousd
on
the
sudden
from
their
drowsy
beds
They
did
amongst
the
troops
of
armed
men
Leap
oer
the
walls
for
refuge
in
the
field
Myself
as
far
as
I
could
well
discern
For
smoke
and
dusky
vapours
of
the
night
Am
sure
I
scard
the
Dauphin
and
his
trull
When
arm
in
arm
they
both
came
swiftly
running
Like
to
a
pair
of
loving
turtledoves
That
could
not
live
asunder
day
or
night
After
that
things
are
set
in
order
here
Well
follow
them

The

Countess

Auvergne
With
modesty
admiring
thy
renown
By

To

castle
where

That

may
boast

beheld
the
man
Whose
glory
fills
the
world
with
loud
report
Is

even

Nay

I

our

Will

into
a
peaceful
comic
sport
When
ladies

to
be
encountred

You

lord
despise
her
gentle

Neer

Will

No

more
than
manners

And
I
have
heard
it
said
unbidden
guests
Are
often
welcomest
when
they
are
gone
Well
then
alone
since
theres
no
remedy
I
mean

prove

ladys
courtesy
Come

Captain
Whispers
You

The

what
I
gave
in
charge
And
when
you
have
done
so
bring
the
keys
to
me
Madam
I
will
The
plot
is
laid
if
all
things
fall
out
right
I
shall
as
famous
be
by
this
exploit
As
Scythian
Tomyris
by
Cyrus
death
Great
is
the
rumour
of
this
dreadful
knight
And
his
achievements
of
no
less
account
Fain
would
mine
eyes
be
witness
with
mine
ears
To
give
their
censure
of
these
rare
reports
Enter
and
Madam
according
as
your
ladyship
desird
By
message
cravd
so
is
Lord
Talbot
come
And
he
is
welcome
What
is
this
the
man
Madam
it
is
Is
this
the
scourge
of
France
Is
this
Talbot
so
much
feard
abroad
That
with
his
name
the
mothers
still
their
babes
I
see
report
is
fabulous
and
false
I
thought
I
should
have
seen
some
Hercules
second
Hector
for
his
grim
aspect
And
large
proportion
of
his
strongknit
limbs
Alas
this
is
a
child
a
silly
dwarf
It
cannot
be
this
weak
and
writhled
shrimp
Should
strike
such
terror
to
his
enemies
Madam
I
have
been
bold
to
trouble
you
But
since
your
ladyship
is
not
at
leisure
Ill
sort
some
other
time
to
visit
you
Going
What
means
he
now
Go
ask
him
whither
he
goes
Stay
my
Lord
Talbot
for
my
lady
craves
To
know
the
cause
of
your
abrupt
departure
Marry
for
that
shes
in
a
wrong
belief
I
go
to
certify
her
Talbots
here
Reenter
With
keys
If
thou
be
he
then
art
thou
prisoner
Prisoner
To
whom
To
me
bloodthirsty
lord
And
for
that
cause
I
traind
thee
to
my
house
Long
time
thy
shadow
hath
been
thrall
to
me
For
in
my
gallery
thy
picture
hangs
But
now
the
substance
shall
endure
the
like
And
I
will
chain
these
legs
and
arms
of
thine
That
hast
by
tyranny
these
many
years
Wasted
our
country
slain
our
citizens
And
sent
our
sons
and
husbands
captivate
Ha
ha
ha
Laughest
thou
wretch
Thy
mirth
shall
turn
to
moan
I
laugh
to
see
your
ladyship
so
fond
To
think
that
you
have
aught
but
Talbots
shadow
Whereon
to
practise
your
severity
Why
art
not
thou
the
man
I
am
indeed
Then
have
I
substance
too
No
no
I
am
but
shadow
of
myself
You
are
deceivd
my
substance
is
not
here
For
what
you
see
is
but
the
smallest
part
And
least
proportion
of
humanity
I
tell
you
madam
were
the
whole
frame
here
It
is
of
such
a
spacious
lofty
pitch
Your
roof
were
not
sufficient
to
contain
t
This
is
a
riddling
merchant
for
the
nonce
He
will
be
here
and
yet
he
is
not
here
How
can
these
contrarieties
agree
That
will
I
show
you
presently
Winds
his
horn
drums
strike
up
a
peal
of
ordnance
Enter
soldiers
How
say
you
madam
Are
you
now
persuaded
That
Talbot
is
but
shadow
of
himself
These
are
his
substance
sinews
arms
and
strength
With
which
he
yoketh
your
rebellious
necks
Razeth
your
cities
and
subverts
your
towns
And
in
a
moment
makes
them
desolate
Victorious
Talbot
pardon
my
abuse
I
find
thou
art
no
less
than
fame
hath
bruited
And
more
than
may
be
gathered
by
thy
shape
Let
my
presumption
not
provoke
thy
wrath
For
I
am
sorry
that
with
reverence
I
did
not
entertain
thee
as
thou
art
Be
not
dismayd
fair
lady
nor
misconster
The
mind
of
Talbot
as
you
did
mistake
The
outward
composition
of
his
body
What
you
have
done
hath
not
offended
me
Nor
other
satisfaction
do
I
crave
But
only
with
your
patience
that
we
may
Taste
of
your
wine
and
see
what
cates
you
have
For
soldiers
stomachs
always
serve
them
well
With
all
my
heart
and
think
me
honoured
To
feast
so
great
a
warrior
in
my
house
London
The
Temple
garden
Enter
the
and
and
another
Great
lords
and
gentlemen
what
means
this
silence
Dare
no
man
answer
in
a
case
of
truth
Within
the
Temple
Hall
we
were
too
loud
The
garden
here
is
more
convenient
Then
say
at
once
if
I
maintaind
the
truth
Or
else
was
wrangling
Somerset
in
th
error
Faith
I
have
been
a
truant
in
the
law
And
never
yet
could
frame
my
will
to
it
And
therefore
frame
the
law
unto
my
will
Judge
you
my
Lord
of
Warwick
then
between
us
Between
two
hawks
which
flies
the
higher
pitch
Between
two
dogs
which
hath
the
deeper
mouth
Between
two
blades
which
bears
the
better
temper
Between
two
horses
which
doth
bear
him
best
Between
two
girls
which
hath
the
merriest
eye
I
have
perhaps
some
shallow
spirit
of
judgment
But
in
these
nice
sharp
quillets
of
the
law
Good
faith
I
am
no
wiser
than
a
daw
Tut
tut
here
is
a
mannerly
forbearance
The
truth
appears
so
naked
on
my
side
That
any
purblind
eye
may
find
it
out
And
on
my
side
it
is
so
well
apparelld
So
clear
so
shining
and
so
evident
That
it
will
glimmer
through
a
blind
mans
eye
Since
you
are
tonguetied
and
so
loath
to
speak
In
dumb
significants
proclaim
your
thoughts
Let
him
that
is
a
trueborn
gentleman
And
stands
upon
the
honour
of
his
birth
If
he
suppose
that
I
have
pleaded
truth
From
off
this
brier
pluck
a
white
rose
with
me
Let
him
that
is
no
coward
nor
no
flatterer
But
dare
maintain
the
party
of
the
truth
Pluck
a
red
rose
from
off
this
thorn
with
me
I
love
no
colours
and
without
all
colour
Of
base
insinuating
flattery
I
pluck
this
white
rose
with
Plantagenet
I
pluck
this
red
rose
with
young
Somerset
And
say
withal
I
think
he
held
the
right
Stay
lords
and
gentlemen
and
pluck
no
more
Till
you
conclude
that
he
upon
whose
side
The
fewest
roses
are
croppd
from
the
tree
Shall
yield
the
other
in
the
right
opinion
Good
Master
Vernon
it
is
well
objected
If
I
have
fewest
I
subscribe
in
silence
And
I
Then
for
the
truth
and
plainness
of
the
case
I
pluck
this
pale
and
maiden
blossom
here
Giving
my
verdict
on
the
white
rose
side
Prick
not
your
finger
as
you
pluck
it
off
Lest
bleeding
you
do
paint
the
white
rose
red
And
fall
on
my
side
so
against
your
will
If
I
my
lord
for
my
opinion
bleed
Opinion
shall
be
surgeon
to
my
hurt
And
keep
me
on
the
side
where
still
I
am
Well
well
come
on
who
else
To
Somerset
Unless
my
study
and
my
books
be
false
The
argument
you
held
was
wrong
in
you
In
sign
whereof
I
pluck
a
white
rose
too
Now
Somerset
where
is
your
argument
Here
in
my
scabbard
meditating
that
Shall
dye
your
white
rose
in
a
bloody
red
Meantime
your
cheeks
do
counterfeit
our
roses
For
pale
they
look
with
fear
as
witnessing
The
truth
on
our
side
No
Plantagenet
Tis
not
for
fear
but
anger
that
thy
cheeks
Blush
for
pure
shame
to
counterfeit
our
roses
And
yet
thy
tongue
will
not
confess
thy
error
Hath
not
thy
rose
a
canker
Somerset
Hath
not
thy
rose
a
thorn
Plantagenet
Ay
sharp
and
piercing
to
maintain
his
truth
Whiles
thy
consuming
canker
eats
his
falsehood
Well
Ill
find
friends
to
wear
my
bleeding
roses
That
shall
maintain
what
I
have
said
is
true
Where
false
Plantagenet
dare
not
be
seen
Now
by
this
maiden
blossom
in
my
hand
I
scorn
thee
and
thy
fashion
peevish
boy
Turn
not
thy
scorns
this
way
Plantagenet
Proud
Pole
I
will
and
scorn
both
him
and
thee
Ill
turn
my
part
thereof
into
thy
throat
Away
away
good
William
de
la
Pole
We
grace
the
yeoman
by
conversing
with
him
Now
by
Gods
will
thou
wrongst
him
Somerset
His
grandfather
was
Lionel
Duke
of
Clarence
Third
son
to
the
third
Edward
King
of
England
Spring
crestless
yeomen
from
so
deep
a
root
He
bears
him
on
the
places
privilege
Or
durst
not
for
his
craven
heart
say
thus
By
Him
that
made
me
Ill
maintain
my
words
On
any
plot
of
ground
in
Christendom
Was
not
thy
father
Richard
Earl
of
Cambridge
For
treason
executed
in
our
late
kings
days
And
by
his
treason
standst
not
thou
attainted
Corrupted
and
exempt
from
ancient
gentry
His
trespass
yet
lives
guilty
in
thy
blood
And
till
thou
be
restord
thou
art
a
yeoman
My
father
was
attached
not
attainted
Condemnd
to
die
for
treason
but
no
traitor
And
that
Ill
prove
on
better
men
than
Somerset
Were
growing
time
once
ripened
to
my
will
For
your
partaker
Pole
and
you
yourself
Ill
note
you
in
my
book
of
memory
To
scourge
you
for
this
apprehension
Look
to
it
well
and
say
you
are
well
warnd
Ay
thou
shalt
find
us
ready
for
thee
still
And
know
us
by
these
colours
for
thy
foes
For
these
my
friends
in
spite
of
thee
shall
wear
And
by
my
soul
this
pale
and
angry
rose
As
cognizance
of
my
blooddrinking
hate
Will
I
for
ever
and
my
faction
wear
Until
it
wither
with
me
to
my
grave
Or
flourish
to
the
height
of
my
degree
Go
forward
and
be
chokd
with
thy
ambition
And
so
farewell
until
I
meet
thee
next
Have
with
thee
Pole
Farewell
ambitious
Richard
How
I
am
bravd
and
must
perforce
endure
it
This
blot
that
they
object
against
your
house
Shall
be
wipd
out
in
the
next
Parliament
Calld
for
the
truce
of
Winchester
and
Gloucester
And
if
thou
be
not
then
created
York
I
will
not
live
to
be
accounted
Warwick
Meantime
in
signal
of
my
love
to
thee
Against
proud
Somerset
and
William
Pole
Will
I
upon
thy
party
wear
this
rose
And
here
I
prophesy
this
brawl
today
Grown
to
this
faction
in
the
Temple
Garden
Shall
send
between
the
Red
Rose
and
the
White
thousand
souls
to
death
and
deadly
night
Good
Master
Vernon
I
am
bound
to
you
That
you
on
my
behalf
would
pluck
a
flower
In
your
behalf
still
will
I
wear
the
same
And
so
will
I
Thanks
gentle
sir
Come
let
us
four
to
dinner
I
dare
say
This
quarrel
will
drink
blood
another
day
The
Tower
of
London
Enter
brought
in
a
chair
and
Kind
keepers
of
my
weak
decaying
age
Let
dying
Mortimer
here
rest
himself
Even
like
a
man
new
haled
from
the
rack
So
fare
my
limbs
with
long
imprisonment
And
these
grey
locks
the
pursuivants
of
death
Nestorlike
aged
in
an
age
of
care
Argue
the
end
of
Edmund
Mortimer
These
eyes
like
lamps
whose
wasting
oil
is
spent
Wax
dim
as
drawing
to
their
exigent
Weak
shoulders
overborne
with
burdening
grief
And
pithless
arms
like
to
a
withered
vine
That
droops
his
sapless
branches
to
the
ground
Yet
are
these
feet
whose
strengthless
stay
is
numb
Unable
to
support
this
lump
of
clay
Swiftwinged
with
desire
to
get
a
grave
As
witting
I
no
other
comfort
have
But
tell
me
keeper
will
my
nephew
come
Richard
Plantagenet
my
lord
will
come
We
sent
unto
the
Temple
unto
his
chamber
And
answer
was
returnd
that
he
will
come
Enough
my
soul
shall
then
be
satisfied
Poor
gentleman
his
wrong
doth
equal
mine
Since
Henry
Monmouth
first
began
to
reign
Before
whose
glory
I
was
great
in
arms
This
loathsome
sequestration
have
I
had
And
even
since
then
hath
Richard
been
obscurd
Deprivd
of
honour
and
inheritance
But
now
the
arbitrator
of
despairs
Just
Death
kind
umpire
of
mens
miseries
With
sweet
enlargement
doth
dismiss
me
hence
I
would
his
troubles
likewise
were
expird
That
so
he
might
recover
what
was
lost
Enter
My
lord
your
loving
nephew
now
is
come
Richard
Plantagenet
my
friend
is
he
come
Ay
noble
uncle
thus
ignobly
usd
Your
nephew
late
despised
Richard
comes
Direct
mine
arms
I
may
embrace
his
neck
And
in
his
bosom
spend
my
latter
gasp
tell
me
when
my
lips
do
touch
his
cheeks
That
I
may
kindly
give
one
fainting
kiss
And
now
declare
sweet
stem
from
Yorks
great
stock
Why
didst
thou
say
of
late
thou
wert
despisd
First
lean
thine
aged
back
against
mine
arm
And
in
that
ease
Ill
tell
thee
my
disease
This
day
in
argument
upon
a
case
Some
words
there
grew
twixt
Somerset
and
me
Among
which
terms
he
usd
his
lavish
tongue
And
did
upbraid
me
with
my
fathers
death
Which
obloquy
set
bars
before
my
tongue
Else
with
the
like
I
had
requited
him
Therefore
good
uncle
for
my
fathers
sake
In
honour
of
a
true
Plantagenet
And
for
alliance
sake
declare
the
cause
My
father
Earl
of
Cambridge
lost
his
head
That
cause
fair
nephew
that
imprisond
me
And
hath
detaind
me
all
my
flowring
youth
Within
a
loathsome
dungeon
there
to
pine
Was
cursed
instrument
of
his
decease
Discover
more
at
large
what
cause
that
was
For
I
am
ignorant
and
cannot
guess
I
will
if
that
my
fading
breath
permit
And
death
approach
not
ere
my
tale
be
done
Henry
the
Fourth
grandfather
to
this
king
Deposd
his
nephew
Richard
Edwards
son
The
firstbegotten
and
the
lawful
heir
Of
Edward
king
the
third
of
that
descent
During
whose
reign
the
Percies
of
the
north
Finding
his
usurpation
most
unjust
Endeavourd
my
advancement
to
the
throne
The
reason
movd
these
warlike
lords
to
this
Was
for
thatyoung
Richard
thus
removd
Leaving
no
heir
begotten
of
his
body
I
was
the
next
by
birth
and
parentage
For
by
my
mother
I
derived
am
From
Lionel
Duke
of
Clarence
third
son
To
King
Edward
the
Third
whereas
he
From
John
of
Gaunt
doth
bring
his
pedigree
Being
but
fourth
of
that
heroic
line
But
mark
as
in
this
haughty
great
attempt
They
laboured
to
plant
the
rightful
heir
I
lost
my
liberty
and
they
their
lives
Long
after
this
when
Henry
the
Fifth
Succeeding
his
father
Bolingbroke
did
reign
Thy
father
Earl
of
Cambridge
then
derivd
From
famous
Edmund
Langley
Duke
of
York
Marrying
my
sister
that
thy
mother
was
Again
in
pity
of
my
hard
distress
Levied
an
army
weening
to
redeem
And
have
installd
me
in
the
diadem
But
as
the
rest
so
fell
that
noble
earl
And
was
beheaded
Thus
the
Mortimers
In
whom
the
title
rested
were
suppressd
Of
Which
my
lord
your
honour
is
the
last
True
and
thou
seest
that
I
no
issue
have
And
that
my
fainting
words
do
warrant
death
Thou
art
my
heir
the
rest
I
wish
thee
gather
But
yet
be
wary
in
thy
studious
care
Thy
grave
admonishments
prevail
with
me
But
yet
methinks
my
fathers
execution
Was
nothing
less
than
bloody
tyranny
With
silence
nephew
be
thou
politic
Strong
fixed
is
the
house
of
Lancaster
And
like
a
mountain
not
to
be
removd
But
now
thy
uncle
is
removing
hence
As
princes
do
their
courts
when
they
are
cloyd
With
long
continuance
in
a
settled
place
uncle
would
some
part
of
my
young
years
Might
but
redeem
the
passage
of
your
age
Thou
dost
then
wrong
me
as
that
slaughterer
doth
Which
giveth
many
wounds
when
one
will
kill
Mourn
not
except
thou
sorrow
for
my
good
Only
give
order
for
my
funeral
And
so
farewell
and
fair
be
all
thy
hopes
And
prosperous
be
thy
life
in
peace
and
war
Dies
And
peace
no
war
befall
thy
parting
soul
In
prison
hast
thou
spent
a
pilgrimage
And
like
a
hermit
overpassd
thy
days
Well
I
will
lock
his
counsel
in
my
breast
And
what
I
do
imagine
let
that
rest
Keepers
convey
him
hence
and
I
myself
Will
see
his
burial
better
than
his
life
Here
dies
the
dusky
torch
of
Mortimer
Chokd
with
ambition
of
the
meaner
sort
And
for
those
wrongs
those
bitter
injuries
Which
Somerset
hath
offerd
to
my
house
I
doubt
not
but
with
honour
to
redress
And
therefore
haste
I
to
the
Parliament
Either
to
be
restored
to
my
blood
Or
make
my
ill
th
advantage
of
my
good
London
The
Parliament
House
Flourish
Enter
the
and
the
and
others
offers
to
put
up
a
bill
snatches
it
and
tears
it
Comst
thou
with
deep
premeditated
lines
With
written
pamphlets
studiously
devisd
Humphrey
of
Gloucester
if
thou
canst
accuse
Or
aught
intendst
to
lay
unto
my
charge
Do
it
without
invention
suddenly
I
with
sudden
and
extemporal
speech
Purpose
to
answer
what
thou
canst
object
Presumptuous
priest
this
place
commands
my
patience
Or
thou
shouldst
find
thou
hast
dishonourd
me
Think
not
although
in
writing
I
preferrd
The
manner
of
thy
vile
outrageous
crimes
That
therefore
I
have
forgd
or
am
not
able
Verbatim
to
rehearse
the
method
of
my
pen
No
prelate
such
is
thy
audacious
wickedness
Thy
lewd
pestiferous
and
dissentious
pranks
As
very
infants
prattle
of
thy
pride
Thou
art
a
most
pernicious
usurer
Froward
by
nature
enemy
to
peace
Lascivious
wanton
more
than
well
beseems
man
of
thy
profession
and
degree
And
for
thy
treachery
whats
more
manifest
In
that
thou
laidst
a
trap
to
take
my
life
As
well
at
London
Bridge
as
at
the
Tower
Beside
I
fear
me
if
thy
thoughts
were
sifted
The
King
thy
sovereign
is
not
quite
exempt
From
envious
malice
of
thy
swelling
heart
Gloucester
I
do
defy
thee
Lords
vouchsafe
To
give
me
hearing
what
I
shall
reply
If
I
were
covetous
ambitious
or
perverse
As
he
will
have
me
how
am
I
so
poor
Or
how
haps
it
I
seek
not
to
advance
Or
raise
myself
but
keep
my
wonted
calling
And
for
dissension
who
preferreth
peace
More
than
I
do
except
I
be
provokd
No
my
good
lords
it
is
not
that
offends
It
is
not
that
that
incensd
hath
incensd
the
Duke
It
is
because
no
one
should
sway
but
he
No
one
but
he
should
be
about
the
King
And
that
engenders
thunder
in
his
breast
And
makes
him
roar
these
accusations
forth
But
he
shall
know
I
am
as
good
As
good
Thou
bastard
of
my
grandfather
Ay
lordly
sir
for
what
are
you
I
pray
But
one
imperious
in
anothers
throne
Am
I
not
Protector
saucy
priest
And
am
not
I
a
prelate
of
the
church
Yes
as
an
outlaw
in
a
castle
keeps
And
useth
it
to
patronage
his
theft
Unreverent
Gloucester
Thou
art
reverend
Touching
thy
spiritual
function
not
thy
life
Rome
shall
remedy
this
Roam
thither
then
My
lord
it
were
your
duty
to
forbear
Ay
see
the
bishop
be
not
overborne
Methinks
my
lord
should
be
religious
And
know
the
office
that
belongs
to
such
Methinks
his
lordship
should
be
humbler
It
fitteth
not
a
prelate
so
to
plead
Yes
when
his
holy
state
is
touchd
so
near
State
holy
or
unhallowd
what
of
that
Is
not
his
Grace
Protector
to
the
King
Aside
Plantagenet
I
see
must
hold
his
tongue
Lest
it
be
said
Speak
sirrah
when
you
should
Must
your
bold
verdict
enter
talk
with
lords
Else
would
I
have
a
fling
at
Winchester
Uncles
of
Gloucester
and
of
Winchester
The
special
watchmen
of
our
English
weal
I
would
prevail
if
prayers
might
prevail
To
join
your
hearts
in
love
and
amity
what
a
scandal
is
it
to
our
crown
That
two
such
noble
peers
as
ye
should
jar
Believe
me
lords
my
tender
years
can
tell
Civil
dissension
is
a
viperous
worm
That
gnaws
the
bowels
of
the
commonwealth
noise
within
Down
with
the
tawny
coats
What
tumults
this
An
uproar
I
dare
warrant
Begun
through
malice
of
the
Bishops
men
noise
again
Stones
Stones
Enter
the
attended
my
good
lords
and
virtuous
Henry
Pity
the
city
of
London
pity
us
The
Bishop
and
the
Duke
of
Gloucesters
men
Forbidden
late
to
carry
any
weapon
Have
filld
their
pockets
full
of
pebble
stones
And
banding
themselves
in
contrary
parts
Do
pelt
so
fast
at
one
anothers
pate
That
many
have
their
giddy
brains
knockd
out
Our
windows
are
broke
down
in
every
street
And
we
for
fear
compelld
to
shut
our
shops
Enter
in
skirmish
the
retainers
of
and
with
bloody
pates
We
charge
you
on
allegiance
to
ourself
To
hold
your
slaughtring
hands
and
keep
the
peace
Pray
uncle
Gloucester
mitigate
this
strife
Nay
if
we
be
forbidden
stones
well
fall
to
it
with
our
teeth
Do
what
ye
dare
we
are
as
resolute
Skirmish
again
You
of
my
household
leave
this
peevish
broil
And
set
this
unaccustomd
fight
aside
My
lord
we
know
your
Grace
to
be
a
man
Just
and
upright
and
for
your
royal
birth
Inferior
to
none
but
to
his
Majesty
And
ere
that
we
will
suffer
such
a
prince
So
kind
a
father
of
the
commonweal
To
be
disgraced
by
an
inkhorn
mate
We
and
our
wives
and
children
all
will
fight
And
have
our
bodies
slaughtred
by
thy
foes
Ay
and
the
very
parings
of
our
nails
Shall
pitch
a
field
when
we
are
dead
Begin
again
Stay
stay
I
say
And
if
you
love
me
as
you
say
you
do
Let
me
persuade
you
to
forbear
awhile
how
this
discord
doth
afflict
my
soul
Can
you
my
Lord
of
Winchester
behold
My
sighs
and
tears
and
will
not
once
relent
Who
should
be
pitiful
if
you
be
not
Or
who
should
study
to
prefer
a
peace
If
holy
churchmen
take
delight
in
broils
Yield
my
Lord
Protector
yield
Winchester
Except
you
mean
with
obstinate
repulse
To
slay
your
sovereign
and
destroy
the
realm
You
see
what
mischief
and
what
murder
too
Hath
been
enacted
through
your
enmity
Then
be
at
peace
except
ye
thirst
for
blood
He
shall
submit
or
I
will
never
yield
Compassion
on
the
King
commands
me
stoop
Or
I
would
see
his
heart
out
ere
the
priest
Should
ever
get
that
privilege
of
me
Behold
my
Lord
of
Winchester
the
Duke
Hath
banishd
moody
discontented
fury
As
by
his
smoothed
brows
it
doth
appear
Why
look
you
still
so
stem
and
tragical
Here
Winchester
I
offer
thee
my
hand
Fie
uncle
Beaufort
I
have
heard
you
preach
That
malice
was
a
great
and
grievous
sin
And
will
not
you
maintain
the
thing
you
teach
But
prove
a
chief
offender
in
the
same
Sweet
King
The
Bishop
hath
a
kindly
gird
For
shame
my
Lord
of
Winchester
relent
What
shall
a
child
instruct
you
what
to
do
Well
Duke
of
Gloucester
I
will
yield
to
thee
Love
for
thy
love
and
hand
for
hand
I
give
Aside
Ay
but
I
fear
me
with
a
hollow
heart
See
here
my
friends
and
loving
countrymen
This
token
serveth
for
a
flag
of
truce
Betwixt
ourselves
and
all
our
followers
So
help
me
God
as
I
dissemble
not
Aside
So
help
me
God
as
I
intend
it
not
loving
uncle
kind
Duke
of
Gloucester
How
joyful
am
I
made
by
this
contract
Away
my
masters
trouble
us
no
more
But
join
in
friendship
as
your
lords
have
done
Content
Ill
to
the
surgeons
And
so
will
I
And
I
will
see
what
physic
the
tavern
affords
Accept
this
scroll
most
gracious
sovereign
Which
in
the
right
of
Richard
Plantagenet
We
do
exhibit
to
your
Majesty
Well
urgd
my
Lord
of
Warwick
for
sweet
prince
An
if
your
Grace
mark
every
circumstance
You
have
great
reason
to
do
Richard
right
Especially
for
those
occasions
At
Eltham
Place
I
told
your
Majesty
And
those
occasions
uncle
were
of
force
Therefore
my
loving
lords
our
pleasure
is
That
Richard
be
restored
to
his
blood
Let
Richard
be
restored
to
his
blood
So
shall
his
fathers
wrongs
be
recompensd
As
will
the
rest
so
willeth
Winchester
If
Richard
will
be
true
not
that
alone
But
all
the
whole
inheritance
I
give
That
doth
belong
unto
the
house
of
York
From
whence
you
spring
by
lineal
descent
Thy
humble
servant
vows
obedience
And
humble
service
till
the
point
of
death
Stoop
then
and
set
your
knee
against
my
foot
And
in
reguerdon
of
that
duty
done
I
girt
thee
with
the
valiant
sword
of
York
Rise
Richard
like
a
true
Plantagenet
And
rise
created
princely
Duke
of
York
And
so
thrive
Richard
as
thy
foes
may
fall
And
as
my
duty
springs
so
perish
they
That
grudge
one
thought
against
your
Majesty
Welcome
high
Prince
the
mighty
Duke
of
York
Aside
Perish
base
Prince
ignoble
Duke
of
York
Now
will
it
best
avail
your
Majesty
To
cross
the
seas
and
to
be
crownd
in
France
The
presence
of
a
king
engenders
love
Amongst
his
subjects
and
his
loyal
friends
As
it
disanimates
his
enemies
When
Gloucester
says
the
word
King
Henry
goes
For
friendly
counsel
cuts
off
many
foes
Your
ships
already
are
in
readiness
Sennet
Flourish
Ay
we
may
march
in
England
or
in
France
Not
seeing
what
is
likely
to
ensue
This
late
dissension
grown
betwixt
the
peers
Burns
under
feigned
ashes
of
forgd
love
And
will
at
last
break
out
into
a
flame
As
festred
members
rot
but
by
degree
Till
bones
and
flesh
and
sinews
fall
away
So
will
this
base
and
envious
discord
breed
And
now
I
fear
that
fatal
prophecy
Which
in
the
time
of
Henry
namd
the
Fifth
Was
in
the
mouth
of
every
sucking
babe
That
Henry
born
at
Monmouth
should
win
all
And
Henry
born
at
Windsor
should
lose
all
Which
is
so
plain
that
Exeter
doth
wish
His
days
may
finish
ere
that
hapless
time
France
Before
Rouen
Enter
disguisd
with
four
soldiers
dressed
like
countrymen
with
sacks
upon
their
backs
These
are
the
city
gates
the
gates
of
Rouen
Through
which
our
policy
must
make
a
breach
Take
heed
be
wary
how
you
place
your
words
Talk
like
the
vulgar
sort
of
marketmen
That
come
to
gather
money
for
their
corn
If
we
have
entrance
as
I
hope
we
shall
And
that
we
find
the
slothful
watch
but
weak
Ill
by
a
sign
give
notice
to
our
friends
That
Charles
the
Dauphin
may
encounter
them
Our
sacks
shall
be
a
mean
to
sack
the
city
And
we
be
lords
and
rulers
over
Rouen
Therefore
well
knock
Knocks
Within
Qui
est
la
Paysans
pauvres
gens
de
France
Poor
marketfolks
that
come
to
sell
their
corn
Enter
go
in
the
marketbell
is
rung
Now
Rouen
Ill
shake
thy
bulwarks
to
the
ground
c
enter
the
town
Enter
and
forces
Saint
Denis
bless
this
happy
stratagem
And
once
again
well
sleep
secure
in
Rouen
Here
entred
Pucelle
and
her
practisants
Now
she
is
there
how
will
she
specify
Here
is
the
best
and
safest
passage
in
By
thrusting
out
a
torch
from
yonder
tower
Which
once
discernd
shows
that
her
meaning
is
No
way
to
that
for
weakness
which
she
entred
Enter
on
the
top
thrusting
out
a
torch
burning
Behold
this
is
the
happy
wedding
torch
That
joineth
Rouen
unto
her
countrymen
But
burning
fatal
to
the
Talbotites
See
noble
Charles
the
beacon
of
our
friend
The
burning
torch
in
yonder
turret
stands
Now
shine
it
like
a
comet
of
revenge
prophet
to
the
fall
of
all
our
foes
Defer
no
time
delays
have
dangerous
ends
Enter
and
cry
The
Dauphin
presently
And
then
do
execution
on
the
watch
Alarum
An
alarum
Enter
in
an
excursion
France
thou
shalt
rue
this
treason
with
thy
tears
If
Talbot
but
survive
thy
treachery
that
witch
that
damned
sorceress
Hath
wrought
this
hellish
mischief
unawares
That
hardly
we
escapd
the
pride
of
France
An
alarum
excursions
brought
in
sick
in
a
chair
Enter
and
without
within
and
on
the
walls
Good
morrow
gallants
Want
ye
corn
for
bread
I
think
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
will
fast
Before
hell
buy
again
at
such
a
rate
Twas
full
of
darneldo
you
like
the
taste
Scoff
on
vile
fiend
and
shameless
courtezan
I
trust
ere
long
to
choke
thee
with
thine
own
And
make
thee
curse
the
harvest
of
that
corn
Your
Grace
may
starve
perhaps
before
that
time
let
no
words
but
deeds
revenge
this
treason
What
you
do
good
grey
beard
Break
a
lance
And
run
a
tilt
at
death
within
a
chair
Foul
fiend
of
France
and
hag
of
all
despite
Encompassd
with
thy
lustful
paramours
Becomes
it
thee
to
taunt
his
valiant
age
And
twit
with
cowardice
a
man
half
dead
Damsel
Ill
have
a
bout
with
you
again
Or
else
let
Talbot
perish
with
this
shame
Are
ye
so
hot
sir
Yet
Pucelle
hold
thy
peace
If
Talbot
do
but
thunder
rain
will
follow
The
English
party
whisper
together
in
council
God
speed
the
parliament
Who
shall
be
the
Speaker
Dare
ye
come
forth
and
meet
us
in
the
field
Belike
your
lordship
takes
us
then
for
fools
To
try
if
that
our
own
be
ours
or
no
I
speak
not
to
that
railing
Hecate
But
unto
thee
Alencon
and
the
rest
Will
ye
like
soldiers
come
and
fight
it
out
Signior
no
Signior
hang
Base
muleteers
of
France
Like
peasant
footboys
do
they
keep
the
walls
And
dare
not
take
up
arms
like
gentlemen
Away
captains
Lets
get
us
from
the
walls
For
Talbot
means
no
goodness
by
his
looks
God
buy
my
lord
we
came
but
to
tell
you
That
we
are
here
And
there
will
we
be
too
ere
it
be
long
Or
else
reproach
be
Talbots
greatest
fame
Vow
Burgundy
by
honour
of
thy
house
Prickd
on
by
public
wrongs
sustaind
in
France
Either
to
get
the
town
again
or
die
And
I
as
sure
as
English
Henry
lives
And
as
his
father
here
was
conqueror
As
sure
as
in
this
late
betrayed
town
Great
Coeurdelions
heart
was
buried
So
sure
I
swear
to
get
the
town
or
die
My
vows
are
equal
partners
with
thy
vows
But
ere
we
go
regard
this
dying
prince
The
valiant
Duke
of
Bedford
Come
my
lord
We
will
bestow
you
in
some
better
place
Fitter
for
sickness
and
for
crazy
age
Lord
Talbot
do
not
so
dishonour
me
Here
will
I
sit
before
the
walls
of
Rouen
And
will
be
partner
of
your
weal
or
woe
Courageous
Bedford
let
us
now
persuade
you
Not
to
be
gone
from
hence
for
once
I
read
That
stout
Pendragon
in
his
litter
sick
Came
to
the
field
and
vanquished
his
foes
Methinks
I
should
revive
the
soldiers
hearts
Because
I
ever
found
them
as
myself
Undaunted
spirit
in
a
dying
breast
Then
be
it
so
Heavens
keep
old
Bedford
safe
And
now
no
more
ado
brave
Burgundy
But
gather
we
our
forces
out
of
hand
And
set
upon
our
boasting
enemy
An
alarum
excursions
Enter
and
a
Whither
away
Sir
John
Fastolfe
in
such
haste
Whither
away
To
save
myself
by
flight
We
are
like
to
have
the
overthrow
again
What
Will
you
and
leave
Lord
Talbot
Ay
All
the
Talbots
in
the
world
to
save
my
life
Cowardly
knight
ill
fortune
follow
thee
Retreat
excursions
and
fly
Now
quiet
soul
depart
when
heaven
please
For
I
have
seen
our
enemies
overthrow
What
is
the
trust
or
strength
of
foolish
man
They
that
of
late
were
daring
with
their
scoffs
Are
glad
and
fain
by
flight
to
save
themselves
dies
and
is
carried
in
by
two
in
his
chair
An
alarum
Reenter
and
the
rest
Lost
and
recovered
in
a
day
again
This
is
a
double
honour
Burgundy
Yet
heavens
have
glory
for
this
victory
Warlike
and
martial
Talbot
Burgundy
Enshrines
thee
in
his
heart
and
there
erects
Thy
noble
deeds
as
valours
monuments
Thanks
gentle
Duke
But
where
is
Pucelle
now
I
think
her
old
familiar
is
asleep
Now
wheres
the
Bastards
braves
and
Charles
his
gleeks
What
all
amort
Rouen
hangs
her
head
for
grief
That
such
a
valiant
company
are
fled
Now
will
we
take
some
order
in
the
town
Placing
therein
some
expert
officers
And
then
depart
to
Paris
to
the
King
For
there
young
Henry
with
his
nobles
lie
What
Lord
Talbot
pleaseth
Burgundy
But
yet
before
we
go
lets
not
forget
The
noble
Duke
of
Bedford
late
deceasd
But
see
his
exequies
fulfilld
in
Rouen
braver
soldier
never
couched
lance
gentler
heart
did
never
sway
in
court
But
kings
and
mightiest
potentates
must
die
For
thats
the
end
of
human
misery
The
plains
near
Rouen
Enter
the
and
forces
Dismay
not
Princes
at
this
accident
Nor
grieve
that
Rouen
is
so
recovered
Care
is
no
cure
but
rather
corrosive
For
things
that
are
not
to
be
remedied
Let
frantic
Talbot
triumph
for
a
while
And
like
a
peacock
sweep
along
his
tail
Well
pull
his
plumes
and
take
away
his
train
If
Dauphin
and
the
rest
will
be
but
ruld
We
have
guided
by
thee
hitherto
And
of
thy
cunning
had
no
diffidence
One
sudden
foil
shall
never
breed
distrust
Search
out
thy
wit
for
secret
policies
And
we
will
make
thee
famous
through
the
world
Well
set
thy
statue
in
some
holy
place
And
have
thee
reverencd
like
a
blessed
saint
Employ
thee
then
sweet
virgin
for
our
good
Then
thus
it
must
be
this
doth
Joan
devise
By
fair
persuasions
mixd
with
sugred
words
We
will
entice
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
To
leave
the
Talbot
and
to
follow
us
Ay
marry
sweeting
if
we
could
do
that
France
were
no
place
for
Henrys
warriors
Nor
should
that
nation
boast
it
so
with
us
But
be
extirped
from
our
provinces
For
ever
should
they
be
expulsd
from
France
And
not
have
tide
of
an
earldom
here
Your
honours
shall
perceive
how
I
will
work
To
bring
this
matter
to
the
wished
end
Drum
sounds
afar
off
Hark
by
the
sound
of
drum
you
may
perceive
Their
powers
are
marching
unto
Parisward
Here
sound
an
English
march
Enter
and
pass
over
at
a
distance
and
his
forces
There
goes
the
Talbot
with
his
colours
spread
And
all
the
troops
of
English
after
him
French
march
Enter
the
and
his
forces
Now
in
the
rearward
comes
the
Duke
and
his
Fortune
in
favour
makes
him
lag
behind
Summon
a
parley
we
will
talk
with
him
Trumpets
sound
a
parley
parley
with
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
Who
craves
a
parley
with
the
Burgundy
The
princely
Charles
of
France
thy
countryman
What
sayst
thou
Charles
for
I
am
marching
hence
Speak
Pucelle
and
enchant
him
with
thy
words
Brave
Burgundy
undoubted
hope
of
France
Stay
let
thy
humble
handmaid
speak
to
thee
Speak
on
but
be
not
overtedious
Look
on
thy
country
look
on
fertile
France
And
see
the
cities
and
the
towns
defacd
By
wasting
ruin
of
the
cruel
foe
As
looks
the
mother
on
her
lowly
babe
When
death
doth
close
his
tender
dying
eyes
See
see
the
pining
malady
of
France
Behold
the
wounds
the
most
unnatural
wounds
Which
thou
thyself
hast
given
her
woeful
breast
turn
thy
edged
sword
another
way
Strike
those
that
hurt
and
hurt
not
those
that
help
One
drop
of
blood
drawn
from
thy
countrys
bosom
Should
grieve
thee
more
than
streams
of
foreign
gore
Return
thee
therefore
with
a
flood
of
tears
And
wash
away
thy
countrys
stained
spots
Either
she
hath
bewitchd
me
with
her
words
Or
nature
makes
me
suddenly
relent
Besides
all
French
and
France
exclaims
on
thee
Doubting
thy
birth
and
lawful
progeny
Who
joinst
thou
with
but
with
a
lordly
nation
That
will
not
trust
thee
but
for
profits
sake
When
Talbot
hath
set
footing
once
in
France
And
fashiond
thee
that
instrument
of
ill
Who
then
but
English
Henry
will
be
lord
And
thou
be
thrust
out
like
a
fugitive
Call
we
to
mindand
mark
but
this
for
proof
Was
not
the
Duke
of
Orleans
thy
foe
And
was
he
not
in
England
prisoner
But
when
they
heard
he
was
thine
enemy
They
set
him
free
without
his
ransom
paid
In
spite
of
Burgundy
and
all
his
friends
See
then
thou
fightst
against
thy
countrymen
And
joinst
with
them
will
be
thy
slaughtermen
Come
come
return
return
thou
wandering
lord
Charles
and
the
rest
will
take
thee
in
their
arms
I
am
vanquished
these
haughty
words
of
hers
Have
battred
me
like
roaring
cannonshot
And
made
me
almost
yield
upon
my
knees
Forgive
me
country
and
sweet
countrymen
And
lords
accept
this
hearty
kind
embrace
My
forces
and
my
power
of
men
are
yours
So
farewell
Talbot
Ill
no
longer
trust
thee
Done
like
a
Frenchman
Aside
turn
and
turn
again
Welcome
brave
Duke
Thy
friendship
makes
us
fresh
And
doth
beget
new
courage
in
our
breasts
Pucelle
hath
bravely
playd
her
part
in
this
And
doth
deserve
a
coronet
of
gold
Now
let
us
on
my
lords
and
join
our
powers
And
seek
how
we
may
prejudice
the
foe
Paris
The
palace
Enter
the
and
others
To
them
with
his
soldiers
My
gracious
Prince
and
honourable
peers
Hearing
of
your
arrival
in
this
realm
I
have
awhile
given
truce
unto
my
wars
To
do
my
duty
to
my
sovereign
In
sign
whereof
this
arm
that
hath
reclaimd
To
your
obedience
fifty
fortresses
Twelve
cities
and
seven
walled
towns
of
strength
Beside
five
hundred
prisoners
of
esteem
Lets
fall
his
sword
before
your
Highness
feet
And
with
submissive
loyalty
of
heart
Ascribes
the
glory
of
his
conquest
got
First
to
my
God
and
next
unto
your
Grace
Kneels
Is
this
the
Lord
Talbot
uncle
Gloucester
That
hath
so
long
been
resident
in
France
Yes
if
it
please
your
Majesty
my
liege
Welcome
brave
captain
and
victorious
lord
When
I
was
young
as
yet
I
am
not
old
I
do
remember
how
my
father
said
stouter
champion
never
handled
sword
Long
since
we
were
resolved
of
your
truth
Your
faithful
service
and
your
toil
in
war
Yet
never
have
you
tasted
our
reward
Or
been
reguerdond
with
so
much
as
thanks
Because
till
now
we
never
saw
your
face
Therefore
stand
up
and
for
these
good
deserts
We
here
create
you
Earl
of
Shrewsbury
And
in
our
coronation
take
your
place
Sennet
Flourish
Now
sir
to
you
that
were
so
hot
at
sea
Disgracing
of
these
colours
that
I
wear
In
honour
of
my
noble
Lord
of
York
Darst
thou
maintain
the
former
words
thou
spakst
Yes
sir
as
well
as
you
dare
patronage
The
envious
barking
of
your
saucy
tongue
Against
my
lord
the
Duke
of
Somerset
Sirrah
thy
lord
I
honour
as
he
is
Why
what
is
he
As
good
a
man
as
York
Hark
ye
not
so
In
witness
take
ye
that
Strikes
him
Villain
thou
knowest
the
law
of
arms
is
such
That
whoso
draws
a
sword
tis
present
death
Or
else
this
blow
should
broach
thy
dearest
blood
But
Ill
unto
his
Majesty
and
crave
I
may
have
liberty
to
venge
this
wrong
When
thou
shalt
see
Ill
meet
thee
to
thy
cost
Well
miscreant
Ill
be
there
as
soon
as
you
And
after
meet
you
sooner
than
you
would
Park
The
palace
Enter
the
the
and
others
Lord
Bishop
set
the
crown
upon
his
head
God
save
King
Henry
of
that
name
the
Sixth
Now
Governor
of
Paris
take
your
oath
kneels
That
you
elect
no
other
king
but
him
Esteem
none
friends
but
such
as
are
his
friends
And
none
your
foes
but
such
as
shall
pretend
Malicious
practices
against
his
state
This
shall
ye
do
so
help
you
righteous
God
Enter
My
gracious
sovereign
as
I
rode
from
Calais
To
haste
unto
your
coronation
letter
was
deliverd
to
my
hands
Writ
to
your
Grace
from
th
Duke
of
Burgundy
Shame
to
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
and
thee
I
vowd
base
knight
when
I
did
meet
thee
next
To
tear
the
Garter
from
thy
cravens
leg
Plucking
it
off
Which
I
have
done
because
unworthily
Thou
wast
installed
in
that
high
degree
Pardon
me
princely
Henry
and
the
rest
This
dastard
at
the
battle
of
Patay
When
but
in
all
I
was
six
thousand
strong
And
that
the
French
were
almost
ten
to
one
Before
we
met
or
that
a
stroke
was
given
Like
to
a
trusty
squire
did
run
away
In
which
assault
we
lost
twelve
hundred
men
Myself
and
divers
gentlemen
beside
Were
there
surprisd
and
taken
prisoners
Then
judge
great
lords
if
I
have
done
amiss
Or
whether
that
such
cowards
ought
to
wear
This
ornament
of
knighthoodyea
or
no
To
say
the
truth
this
fact
was
infamous
And
ill
beseeming
any
common
man
Much
more
a
knight
a
captain
and
a
leader
When
first
this
order
was
ordaind
my
lords
Knights
of
the
Garter
were
of
noble
birth
Valiant
and
virtuous
full
of
haughty
courage
Such
as
were
grown
to
credit
by
the
wars
Not
fearing
death
nor
shrinking
for
distress
But
always
resolute
in
most
extremes
He
then
that
is
not
furnishd
in
this
sort
Doth
but
usurp
the
sacred
name
of
knight
Profaning
this
most
honourable
order
And
should
if
I
were
worthy
to
be
judge
Be
quite
degraded
like
a
hedgeborn
swain
That
doth
presume
to
boast
of
gentle
blood
Stain
to
thy
countrymen
thou
hearst
thy
doom
Be
packing
therefore
thou
that
wast
a
knight
Henceforth
we
banish
thee
on
pain
of
death
And
now
my
Lord
Protector
view
the
letter
Sent
from
our
uncle
Duke
of
Burgundy
Viewing
the
superscription
What
means
his
Grace
that
he
hath
changd
his
style
No
more
but
plain
and
bluntly
To
the
King
Hath
he
forgot
he
is
his
sovereign
Or
doth
this
churlish
superscription
Pretend
some
alteration
in
goodwill
Whats
here
Reads
I
have
upon
especial
cause
Movd
with
compassion
of
my
countrys
wreck
Together
with
the
pitiful
complaints
Of
such
as
your
oppression
feeds
upon
Forsaken
your
pernicious
faction
And
joind
with
Charles
the
rightful
King
of
France
monstrous
treachery
Can
this
be
so
That
in
alliance
amity
and
oaths
There
should
be
found
such
false
dissembling
guile
What
Doth
my
uncle
Burgundy
revolt
He
doth
my
lord
and
is
become
your
foe
Is
that
the
worst
this
letter
doth
contain
It
is
the
worst
and
all
my
lord
he
writes
Why
then
Lord
Talbot
there
shall
talk
with
him
And
give
him
chastisement
for
this
abuse
How
say
you
my
lord
are
you
not
content
Content
my
liege
Yes
but
that
I
am
prevented
I
should
have
beggd
I
might
have
been
employd
Then
gather
strength
and
march
unto
him
straight
Let
him
perceive
how
ill
we
brook
his
treason
And
what
offence
it
is
to
flout
his
friends
I
go
my
lord
in
heart
desiring
still
You
may
behold
confusion
of
your
foes
Enter
and
Grant
me
the
combat
gracious
sovereign
And
me
my
lord
grant
me
the
combat
too
This
is
my
servant
hear
him
noble
Prince
And
this
is
mine
sweet
Henry
favour
him
Be
patient
lords
and
give
them
leave
to
speak
Say
gentlemen
what
makes
you
thus
exclaim
And
wherefore
crave
you
combat
or
with
whom
With
him
my
lord
for
he
hath
done
me
wrong
And
I
with
him
for
he
hath
done
me
wrong
What
is
that
wrong
whereof
you
both
complain
First
let
me
know
and
then
Ill
answer
you
Crossing
the
sea
from
England
into
France
This
fellow
here
with
envious
carping
tongue
Upbraided
me
about
the
rose
I
wear
Saying
the
sanguine
colour
of
the
leaves
Did
represent
my
masters
blushing
cheeks
When
stubbornly
he
did
repugn
the
truth
About
a
certain
question
in
the
law
Argud
betwixt
the
Duke
of
York
and
him
With
other
vile
and
ignominious
terms
In
confutation
of
which
rude
reproach
And
in
defence
of
my
lords
worthiness
I
crave
the
benefit
of
law
of
arms
And
that
is
my
petition
noble
lord
For
though
he
seem
with
forged
quaint
conceit
To
set
a
gloss
upon
his
bold
intent
Yet
know
my
lord
I
was
provokd
by
him
And
he
first
took
exceptions
at
this
badge
Pronouncing
that
the
paleness
of
this
flower
Bewrayd
the
faintness
of
my
masters
heart
Will
not
this
malice
Somerset
be
left
Your
private
grudge
my
Lord
of
York
will
out
Though
neer
so
cunningly
you
smother
it
Good
Lord
what
madness
rules
in
brainsick
men
When
for
so
slight
and
frivolous
a
cause
Such
factious
emulations
shall
arise
Good
cousins
both
of
York
and
Somerset
Quiet
yourselves
I
pray
and
be
at
peace
Let
this
dissension
first
be
tried
by
fight
And
then
your
Highness
shall
command
a
peace
The
quarrel
toucheth
none
but
us
alone
Betwixt
ourselves
let
us
decide
it
then
There
is
my
pledge
accept
it
Somerset
Nay
let
it
rest
where
it
began
at
first
Confirm
it
so
mine
honourable
lord
Confirm
it
so
Confounded
be
your
strife
And
perish
ye
with
your
audacious
prate
Presumptuous
vassals
are
you
not
ashamd
With
this
immodest
clamorous
outrage
To
trouble
and
disturb
the
King
and
us
And
you
my
lords
methinks
you
do
not
well
To
bear
with
their
perverse
objections
Much
less
to
take
occasion
from
their
mouths
To
raise
a
mutiny
betwixt
yourselves
Let
me
persuade
you
take
a
better
course
It
grieves
his
Highness
Good
my
lords
be
friends
Come
hither
you
that
would
be
combatants
Henceforth
I
charge
you
as
you
love
our
favour
Quite
to
forget
this
quarrel
and
the
cause
And
you
my
lords
remember
where
we
are
In
France
amongst
a
fickle
wavering
nation
If
they
perceive
dissension
in
our
looks
And
that
within
ourselves
we
disagree
How
will
their
grudging
stomachs
be
provokd
To
wilful
disobedience
and
rebel
Beside
what
infamy
will
there
arise
When
foreign
princes
shall
be
certified
That
for
a
toy
a
thing
of
no
regard
King
Henrys
peers
and
chief
nobility
Destroyd
themselves
and
lost
the
realm
of
France
think
upon
the
conquest
of
my
father
My
tender
years
and
let
us
not
forgo
That
for
a
trifle
that
was
bought
with
blood
Let
me
be
umpire
in
this
doubtful
strife
I
see
no
reason
if
I
wear
this
rose
Putting
on
a
red
rose
That
any
one
should
therefore
be
suspicious
I
more
incline
to
Somerset
than
York
Both
are
my
kinsmen
and
I
love
them
both
As
well
they
may
upbraid
me
with
my
crown
Because
forsooth
the
King
of
Scots
is
crownd
But
your
discretions
better
can
persuade
Than
I
am
able
to
instruct
or
teach
And
therefore
as
we
hither
came
in
peace
So
let
us
still
continue
peace
and
love
Cousin
of
York
we
institute
your
Grace
To
be
our
Regent
in
these
parts
of
France
And
good
my
Lord
of
Somerset
unite
Your
troops
of
horsemen
with
his
bands
of
foot
And
like
true
subjects
sons
of
your
progenitors
Go
cheerfully
together
and
digest
Your
angry
choler
on
your
enemies
Ourself
my
Lord
Protector
and
the
rest
After
some
respite
will
return
to
Calais
From
thence
to
England
where
I
hope
ere
long
To
be
presented
by
your
victories
With
Charles
Alencon
and
that
traitorous
rout
Flourish
My
Lord
of
York
I
promise
you
the
King
Prettily
methought
did
play
the
orator
And
so
he
did
but
yet
I
like
it
not
In
that
he
wears
the
badge
of
Somerset
Tush
that
was
but
his
fancy
blame
him
not
I
dare
presume
sweet
prince
he
thought
no
harm
An
if
I
wist
he
didbut
let
it
rest
Other
affairs
must
now
be
managed
Well
didst
thou
Richard
to
suppress
thy
voice
For
had
the
passions
of
thy
heart
burst
out
I
fear
we
should
have
seen
decipherd
there
More
rancorous
spite
more
furious
raging
broils
Than
yet
can
be
imagind
or
supposd
But
howsoeer
no
simple
man
that
sees
This
jarring
discord
of
nobility
This
shouldering
of
each
other
in
the
court
This
factious
bandying
of
their
favourites
But
that
it
doth
presage
some
ill
event
Tis
much
when
sceptres
are
in
childrens
hands
But
more
when
envy
breeds
unkind
division
There
comes
the
ruin
there
begins
confusion
France
Before
Bordeaux
Enter
with
trump
and
drum
Go
to
the
gates
of
Bordeaux
trumpeter
Summon
their
general
unto
the
wall
Trumpet
sounds
a
parley
Enter
aloft
the
and
others
English
John
Talbot
Captains
calls
you
forth
Servant
in
arms
to
Harry
King
of
England
And
thus
he
would
open
your
city
gates
Be
humble
to
us
call
my
sovereignvours
And
do
him
homage
as
obedient
subjects
And
Ill
withdraw
me
and
my
bloody
power
But
if
you
frown
upon
this
profferd
peace
You
tempt
the
fury
of
my
three
attendants
Lean
famine
quartering
steel
and
climbing
fire
Who
in
a
moment
even
with
the
earth
Shall
lay
your
stately
and
air
braving
towers
If
you
forsake
the
offer
of
their
love
Thou
ominous
and
fearful
owl
of
death
Our
nations
terror
and
their
bloody
scourge
The
period
of
thy
tyranny
approacheth
On
us
thou
canst
not
enter
but
by
death
For
I
protest
we
are
well
fortified
And
strong
enough
to
issue
out
and
fight
If
thou
retire
the
Dauphin
well
appointed
Stands
with
the
snares
of
war
to
tangle
thee
On
either
hand
thee
there
are
squadrons
pitchd
To
wall
thee
from
the
liberty
of
flight
And
no
way
canst
thou
turn
thee
for
redress
But
death
doth
front
thee
with
apparent
spoil
And
pale
destruction
meets
thee
in
the
face
Ten
thousand
French
have
taen
the
sacrament
To
rive
their
dangerous
artillery
Upon
no
Christian
soul
but
English
Talbot
Lo
there
thou
standst
a
breathing
valiant
man
Of
an
invincible
unconquerd
spirit
This
is
the
latest
glory
of
thy
praise
That
I
thy
enemy
due
thee
withal
For
ere
the
glass
that
now
begins
to
run
Finish
the
process
of
his
sandy
hour
These
eyes
that
see
thee
now
well
coloured
Shall
see
thee
withered
bloody
pale
and
dead
Drum
afar
off
Hark
hark
The
Dauphins
drum
a
warning
bell
Sings
heavy
music
to
thy
timorous
soul
And
mine
shall
ring
thy
dire
departure
out
He
fables
not
I
hear
the
enemy
Out
some
light
horsemen
and
peruse
their
wings
negligent
and
heedless
discipline
How
are
we
parkd
and
bounded
in
a
pale
little
herd
of
Englands
timorous
deer
Mazd
with
a
yelping
kennel
of
French
curs
If
we
be
English
deer
be
then
in
blood
Not
rascallike
to
fall
down
with
a
pinch
But
rather
moodymad
and
desperate
stags
Turn
on
the
bloody
hounds
with
heads
of
steel
And
make
the
cowards
stand
aloof
at
bay
Sell
every
man
his
life
as
dear
as
mine
And
they
shall
find
dear
deer
of
us
my
friends
God
and
Saint
George
Talbot
and
Englands
right
Prosper
our
colours
in
this
dangerous
fight
Plains
in
Gascony
Enter
with
trumpet
and
many
soldiers
meets
him
Are
not
the
speedy
scouts
returnd
again
That
doggd
the
mighty
army
of
the
Dauphin
They
are
returnd
my
lord
and
give
it
out
That
he
is
marchd
to
Bordeaux
with
his
power
To
fight
with
Talbot
as
he
marchd
along
By
your
espials
were
discovered
Two
mightier
troops
than
that
the
Dauphin
led
Which
joind
with
him
and
made
their
march
for
Bordeaux
plague
upon
that
villain
Somerset
That
thus
delays
my
promised
supply
Of
horsemen
that
were
levied
for
this
siege
Renowned
Talbot
doth
expect
my
aid
And
I
am
louted
by
a
traitor
villain
And
cannot
help
the
noble
chevalier
God
comfort
him
in
this
necessity
If
he
miscarry
farewell
wars
in
France
Enter
Thou
princely
leader
of
our
English
strength
Never
so
needful
on
the
earth
of
France
Spur
to
the
rescue
of
the
noble
Talbot
Who
now
is
girdled
with
a
waist
of
iron
And
hemmd
about
with
grim
destruction
To
Bordeaux
warlike
Duke
to
Bordeaux
York
Else
farewell
Talbot
France
and
Englands
honour
God
that
Somerset
who
in
proud
heart
Doth
stop
my
cornets
were
in
Talbots
place
So
should
we
save
a
valiant
gentleman
By
forfeiting
a
traitor
and
a
coward
Mad
ire
and
wrathful
fury
makes
me
weep
That
thus
we
die
while
remiss
traitors
sleep
send
some
succour
to
the
distressd
lord
He
dies
we
lose
I
break
my
warlike
word
We
mourn
France
smiles
We
lose
they
daily
get
All
long
of
this
vile
traitor
Somerset
Then
God
take
mercy
on
brave
Talbots
soul
And
on
his
son
young
John
who
two
hours
since
I
met
in
travel
toward
his
warlike
father
This
seven
years
did
not
Talbot
see
his
son
And
now
they
meet
where
both
their
lives
are
done
Alas
what
joy
shall
noble
Talbot
have
To
bid
his
young
son
welcome
to
his
grave
Away
vexation
almost
stops
my
breath
That
sundred
friends
greet
in
the
hour
of
death
Lucy
farewell
no
more
my
fortune
can
But
curse
the
cause
I
cannot
aid
the
man
Maine
Blois
Poictiers
and
Tours
are
won
away
Long
all
of
Somerset
and
his
delay
Thus
while
the
vulture
of
sedition
Feeds
in
the
bosom
of
such
great
commanders
Sleeping
neglection
doth
betray
to
loss
The
conquest
of
our
scarce
cold
conqueror
That
everliving
man
of
memory
Henry
the
Fifth
Whiles
they
each
other
cross
Lives
honours
lands
and
all
hurry
to
loss
Other
plains
of
Gascony
Enter
With
his
forces
an
of
with
him
It
is
too
late
I
cannot
send
them
now
This
expedition
was
by
York
and
Talbot
Too
rashly
plotted
all
our
general
force
Might
with
a
sally
of
the
very
town
Be
buckled
with
The
over
daring
Talbot
Hath
sullied
all
his
gloss
of
former
honour
By
this
unheedful
desperate
wild
adventure
York
set
him
on
to
fight
and
die
in
shame
That
Talbot
dead
great
York
might
bear
the
name
Here
is
Sir
William
Lucy
who
with
me
Set
from
our
oermatchd
forces
forth
for
aid
Enter
How
now
Sir
William
Whither
were
you
sent
Whither
my
lord
From
bought
and
sold
Lord
Talbot
Who
ringd
about
with
bold
adversity
Cries
out
for
noble
York
and
Somerset
To
beat
assailing
death
from
his
weak
legions
And
whiles
the
honourable
captain
there
Drops
bloody
sweat
from
his
warwearied
limbs
And
in
advantage
lingring
looks
for
rescue
You
his
false
hopes
the
trust
of
Englands
honour
Keep
off
aloof
with
worthless
emulation
Let
not
your
private
discord
keep
away
The
levied
succours
that
should
lend
him
aid
While
he
renowned
noble
gentleman
Yield
up
his
life
unto
a
world
of
odds
Orleans
the
Bastard
Charles
Burgundy
Alencon
Reignier
compass
him
about
And
Talbot
perisheth
by
your
default
York
set
him
on
York
should
have
sent
him
aid
And
York
as
fast
upon
your
Grace
exclaims
Swearing
that
you
withhold
his
levied
host
Collected
for
this
expedition
York
lies
he
might
have
sent
and
had
the
horse
I
owe
him
little
duty
and
less
love
And
take
foul
scorn
to
fawn
on
him
by
sending
The
fraud
of
England
not
the
force
of
France
Hath
now
entrappd
the
noble
minded
Talbot
Never
to
England
shall
he
bear
his
life
But
dies
betrayd
to
fortune
by
your
strife
Come
go
I
will
dispatch
the
horsemen
straight
Within
six
hours
they
will
be
at
his
aid
Too
late
comes
rescue
he
is
taen
or
slain
For
fly
he
could
not
if
he
would
have
fled
And
fly
would
Talbot
never
though
he
might
If
he
be
dead
brave
Talbot
then
adieu
His
fame
lives
in
the
world
his
shame
in
you
The
English
camp
near
Bordeaux
Enter
and
his
son
young
John
Talbot
I
did
send
for
thee
To
tutor
thee
in
stratagems
of
war
That
Talbots
name
might
be
in
thee
revivd
When
sapless
age
and
weak
unable
limbs
Should
bring
thy
father
to
his
drooping
chair
But
malignant
and
illboding
stars
Now
thou
art
come
unto
a
feast
of
death
terrible
and
unavoided
danger
Therefore
dear
boy
mount
on
my
swiftest
horse
And
Ill
direct
thee
how
thou
shalt
escape
By
sudden
flight
Come
dally
not
be
gone
Is
my
name
Talbot
and
am
I
your
son
And
shall
I
fly
if
you
love
my
mother
Dishonour
not
her
honourable
name
To
make
a
bastard
and
a
slave
of
me
The
world
will
say
he
is
not
Talbots
blood
That
basely
fled
when
noble
Talbot
stood
Fly
to
revenge
my
death
if
I
be
slain
He
that
flies
so
will
neer
return
again
If
we
both
stay
we
both
are
sure
to
die
Then
let
me
stay
and
father
do
you
fly
Your
loss
is
great
so
your
regard
should
be
My
worth
unknown
no
loss
is
known
in
me
Upon
my
death
the
French
can
little
boast
In
yours
they
will
in
you
all
hopes
are
lost
Flight
cannot
stain
the
honour
you
have
won
But
mine
it
will
that
no
exploit
have
done
You
fled
for
vantage
every
one
will
swear
But
if
I
bow
theyll
say
it
was
for
fear
There
is
no
hope
that
ever
I
will
stay
If
the
first
hour
I
shrink
and
run
away
Here
on
my
knee
I
beg
mortality
Rather
than
life
preservd
with
infamy
Shall
all
thy
mothers
hopes
lie
in
one
tomb
Ay
rather
than
Ill
shame
my
mothers
womb
Upon
my
blessing
I
command
thee
go
To
fight
I
will
but
not
to
fly
the
foe
Part
of
thy
father
may
be
savd
in
thee
No
part
of
him
but
will
be
shame
in
me
Thou
never
hadst
renown
nor
canst
not
lose
it
Yes
your
renowned
name
shall
flight
abuse
it
Thy
fathers
charge
shall
clear
thee
from
that
stain
You
cannot
witness
for
me
being
slain
If
death
be
so
apparent
then
both
fly
And
leave
my
followers
here
to
fight
and
die
My
age
was
never
tainted
with
such
shame
And
shall
my
youth
be
guilty
of
such
blame
No
more
can
I
be
severed
from
your
side
Than
can
yourself
yourself
yourself
in
twain
divide
Stay
go
do
what
you
will
the
like
do
I
For
live
I
will
not
if
my
father
die
Then
here
I
take
my
leave
of
thee
fair
son
Born
to
eclipse
thy
life
this
afternoon
Come
side
by
side
together
live
and
die
And
soul
with
soul
from
France
to
heaven
fly
field
of
battle
Alarum
excursions
wherein
is
hemmd
about
and
rescues
him
Saint
George
and
victory
Fight
soldiers
fight
The
Regent
hath
with
Talbot
broke
his
word
And
left
us
to
the
rage
of
France
his
sword
Where
is
John
Talbot
Pause
and
take
thy
breath
I
gave
thee
life
and
rescud
thee
from
death
twice
my
father
twice
am
I
thy
son
The
life
thou
gavst
me
first
was
lost
and
done
Till
with
thy
warlike
sword
despite
of
fate
To
my
determind
time
thou
gavst
new
date
When
from
the
Dauphins
crest
thy
sword
struck
fire
It
warmd
thy
fathers
heart
with
proud
desire
Of
boldfacd
victory
Then
leaden
age
Quickend
with
youthful
spleen
and
warlike
rage
Beat
down
Alencon
Orleans
Burgundy
And
from
the
pride
of
Gallia
rescued
thee
The
ireful
bastard
Orleans
that
drew
blood
From
thee
my
boy
and
had
the
maidenhood
Of
thy
first
fight
I
soon
encountered
And
interchanging
blows
I
quickly
shed
Some
of
his
bastard
blood
and
in
disgrace
Bespoke
him
thus
Contaminated
base
And
misbegotten
blood
I
spill
of
thine
Mean
and
right
poor
for
that
pure
blood
of
mine
Which
thou
didst
force
from
Talbot
my
brave
boy
Here
purposing
the
Bastard
to
destroy
Came
in
strong
rescue
Speak
thy
fathers
care
Art
thou
not
weary
John
How
dost
thou
fare
Wilt
thou
yet
leave
the
battle
boy
and
fly
Now
thou
art
seald
the
son
of
chivalry
Fly
to
revenge
my
death
when
I
am
dead
The
help
of
one
stands
me
in
little
stead
too
much
folly
is
it
well
I
wot
To
hazard
all
our
lives
in
one
small
boat
If
I
today
die
not
with
Frenchmens
rage
Tomorrow
I
shall
die
with
mickle
age
By
me
they
nothing
gain
an
if
I
stay
Tis
but
the
shortning
of
my
life
one
day
In
thee
thy
mother
dies
our
households
name
My
deaths
revenge
thy
youth
and
Englands
fame
All
these
and
more
we
hazard
by
thy
stay
All
these
are
savd
if
thou
wilt
fly
away
The
sword
of
Orleans
hath
not
made
me
smart
These
words
of
yours
draw
lifeblood
from
my
heart
On
that
advantage
bought
with
such
a
shame
To
save
a
paltry
life
and
slay
bright
fame
Before
young
Talbot
from
old
Talbot
fly
The
coward
horse
that
bears
me
fall
and
die
And
like
me
to
the
peasant
boys
of
France
To
be
shames
scorn
and
subject
of
mischance
Surely
by
all
the
glory
you
have
won
An
if
I
fly
I
am
not
Talbots
son
Then
talk
no
more
of
flight
it
is
no
boot
If
son
to
Talbot
die
at
Talbots
foot
Then
follow
thou
thy
desprate
sire
of
Crete
Thou
Icarus
thy
life
to
me
is
sweet
If
thou
wilt
fight
fight
by
thy
fathers
side
And
commendable
provd
lets
die
in
pride
Another
part
of
the
field
Alarum
excursions
Enter
old
led
by
a
Where
is
my
other
life
Mine
own
is
gone
wheres
young
Talbot
Where
is
valiant
John
Triumphant
death
smeard
with
captivity
Young
Talbots
valour
makes
me
smile
at
thee
When
he
perceivd
me
shrink
and
on
my
knee
His
bloody
sword
he
brandishd
over
me
And
like
a
hungry
lion
did
commence
Rough
deeds
of
rage
and
stern
impatience
But
when
my
angry
guardant
stood
alone
Tendring
my
ruin
and
assaild
of
none
Dizzyeyd
fury
and
great
rage
of
heart
Suddenly
made
him
from
my
side
to
start
Into
the
clustring
battle
of
the
French
And
in
that
sea
of
blood
my
boy
did
drench
His
overmounting
spirit
and
there
died
My
Icarus
my
blossom
in
his
pride
Enter
soldiers
bearing
the
body
of
my
dear
lord
lo
where
your
son
is
borne
Thou
antic
Death
which
laughst
us
here
to
scorn
Anon
from
thy
insulting
tyranny
Coupled
in
bonds
of
perpetuity
Two
Talbots
winged
through
the
lither
sky
In
thy
despite
shall
scape
mortality
thou
whose
wounds
become
hardfavoured
Death
Speak
to
thy
father
ere
thou
yield
thy
breath
Brave
Death
by
speaking
whether
he
will
or
no
Imagine
him
a
Frenchman
and
thy
foe
Poor
boy
he
smiles
methinks
as
who
should
say
Had
Death
been
French
then
Death
had
died
today
Come
come
and
lay
him
in
his
fathers
arms
My
spirit
can
no
longer
bear
these
harms
Soldiers
adieu
I
have
what
I
would
have
Now
my
old
arms
are
young
John
Talbots
grave
Dies
Enter
and
forces
Had
York
and
Somerset
brought
rescue
in
We
should
have
found
a
bloody
day
of
this
How
the
young
whelp
of
Talbots
raging
wood
Did
flesh
his
puny
sword

blood
Once
I
encountred
him
and
thus
I
said
Thou
maiden
youth
be
vanquishd
by
a
maid
But
with
a
proud
majestical
high
scorn
He
answerd
thus
Young
Talbot
was
not
born
To
be
the
pillage
of
a
giglot
wench
So
rushing
in
the
bowels
of
the
French
He
left
me
proudly
as
unworthy
fight
Doubtless
he
would
have
made
a
noble
knight
See
where
he
lies
inhearsed
in
the
arms
Of
the
most
bloody
nurser
of
his
harms
Hew
them
to
pieces
hack
their
bones
asunder
Whose
life
was
Englands
glory
Gallias
wonder
no
forbear
For
that
which
we
have
fled
During
the
life
let
us
not
wrong
it
dead
Enter
Lucy

to
the

To
know
who
hath
obtaind
the
glory
of

On
what
submissive
message
art
thou
sent
Submission
Dauphin
Tis
a
mere
French
word
We
English
warriors
wot
not
what
it
means
I
come
to
know
what
prisoners
thou
hast
taen
And
to
survey
the
bodies
of
the
dead
For
prisoners
askst
thou
Hell
our

is
But
tell
me
whom
thou
seekst
But
wheres
the

Him

Stinking

Is

That
I
in

I

It
were
enough
to
fright
the

Were
but
his

left
amongst

here
It
would
amaze
the
proudest
of
you
all
Give
me
their
bodies
that
I
may
bear
them
hence
And
give
them
burial
as
beseems
their

I
think
this
upstart
is
old
Talbots
ghost
He
speaks
with
such
a
proud
commanding
spirit
For
Gods
sake
let
him
have
them
to
keep
them
here
They
would
but
stink
and
putrefy
the

Go
take
their

hence
Ill
bear
them
hence
but
from
their
ashes
shall
be

So

They

To
stop
effusion
of

And
stablish

side
Ay

for
I
always
thought
It
was
both
impious
and
unnatural
That
such
immanity
and
bloody
strife
Should
reign
among
professors
of

Beside
my

So

What
Is
my
Lord
of

installd
And
calld
unto
a

Then
I
perceive
that
will
be
verified
Henry
the
Fifth
did
sometime
prophesy
If
once
he
come
to
be
a
cardinal
Hell
make
his

My

Ambassadors
your

Have
been
considerd

debated
on
Your

certainly
resolvd
To

conditions
of
a

Which
by
my

we
mean
Shall

The
sum

Should

For

me
in

I
will

Now
Winchester

trow
Or

to
the

Humphrey

thou
shalt
well
perceive
That
neither

The

The

Into

I

That

My

Changd

No

And
may
ye

By

Fell

I
prithee
give

awhile
Curse
miscreant
when
thou
comest
to

Alarum
Enter
with
in
his
hand
Be
what
thou
wilt
thou
art
my
prisoner
Gazes
on
her
fairest
beauty
do
not
fear
nor
fly
For
I
will
touch
thee
but
with
reverent
hands
I
kiss
these
fingers
for
eternal
peace
And
lay
them
gently
on
thy
tender
side
Who
art
thou
Say
that
I
may
honour
thee
Margaret
my

and
daughter
to
a

The
King

An

I
am
and
Suffolk
am
I
calld
Be
not
offended
natures
miracle
Thou
art
allotted
to
be
taen
by
me
So
doth
the
swan
her
downy
cygnets
save
Keeping
them
prisoner
underneath
her
wings
Yet
if
this
servile
usage
once
offend
Go
and
be
free
again
as
Suffolks
friend
She
is
going
stay
Aside
I
have
no
power
to
let
her
pass
My
hand
would
free
her
but
my
heart
says
no
As
plays
the
sun
upon
the
glassy
streams
Twinkling
another
counterfeited
beam
So
seems
this
gorgeous
beauty
to
mine
eyes
Fain
would
I
woo
her
yet
I
dare
not
speak
Ill
call
for
pen
and
ink
and
write
my
mind
Fie
de
la
Pole
disable
not
thyself
Hast
not
a
tongue
Is
she
not
here
thy
prisoner
Wilt
thou
be
daunted
at
a
womans
sight
Ay
beautys
princely
majesty
is
such
Confounds
the
tongue
and
makes
the
senses
rough
Say
Earl
of
Suffolk
if
thy
name
be
so
What
ransom
must
I
pay
before
I
pass
For
I
perceive
I
am
thy
prisoner
Aside
How
canst
thou
tell
she
will
deny
thy
suit
Before
thou
make
a
trial
of
her
love
Why
speakst
thou
not
What
ransom
must
I
pay
Aside
Shes
beautiful
and
therefore
to
be
wood
She
is
a
woman
therefore
to
be
won
Wilt
thou
accept
of
ransomyea
or
no
Aside
Fond
man
remember
that
thou
hast
a
wife
Then
how
can
Margaret
be
thy
paramour
I
were
best
leave
him
for
he
will
not
hear
Aside
There
all
is
marrd
there
lies
a
cooling
card
He
talks
at
random
sure
the
man
is
mad
Aside
And
yet
a
dispensation
may
be
had
And
yet
I
would
that
you
would
answer
me
Aside
Ill
win
this
Lady
Margaret
For
whom
Why
for
my
King
Tush
thats
a
wooden
thing
He
talks
of
wood
It
is
some
carpenter
Aside
Yet
so
my
fancy
may
be
satisfied
And
peace
established
between
these
realms
But
there
remains
a
scruple
in
that
too
For
though
her
father
be
the
King
of
Naples
Duke
of
Anjou
and
Maine
yet
is
he
poor
And
our
nobility
will
scorn
the
match
Hear
ye
Captainare
you
not
at
leisure
Aside
It
shall
be
so
disdain
they
neer
so
much
Henry
is
youthful
and
will
quickly
yield
Madam
I
have
a
secret
to
reveal
Aside
What
though
I
be
enthralld
He
seems
a
knight
And
will
not
any
way
dishonour
me
Lady
vouchsafe
to
listen
what
I
say
Aside
Perhaps
I
shall
be
rescud
by
the
French
And
then
I
need
not
crave
his
courtesy
Sweet
madam
give
me
hearing
in
a
cause
Aside
Tush
women
have
been
captivate
ere
now
Lady
wherefore
talk
you
so
I
cry
you
mercy
tis
but
quid
for
quo
Say
gentle
Princess
would
you
not
suppose
Your
bondage
happy
to
be
made
a
queen
To
be
a
queen
in
bondage
is
more
vile
Than
is
a
slave
in
base
servility
For
princes
should
be
free
And
so
shall
you
If
happy
Englands
royal
king
be
free
Why
what
concerns
his
freedom
unto
me
Ill
undertake
to
make
thee
Henrys
queen
To
put
a
golden
sceptre
in
thy
hand
And
set
a
precious
crown
upon
thy
head
If
thou
wilt
condescend
to
be
my
What
His
love
I
am
unworthy
to
be
Henrys
wife
No
gentle
madam
I
unworthy
am
To
woo
so
fair
a
dame
to
be
his
wife
And
have
no
portion
in
the
choice
myself
How
say
you
madam
Are
ye
so
content
An
if
my
father
please
I
am
content
Then
call
our
captains
and
our
colours
forth
And
madam
at
your
fathers

Well
crave
a
parley

Sound

Enter

See
Reignier

To

To

Suffolk
what
remedy
I
am
a
soldier
and
unapt
to
weep
Or
to
exclaim
on
fortunes
fickleness
Yes
there
is
remedy
enough
my
lord
Consent
and
for
thy
honour
give
consent
Thy
daughter
shall
be
wedded
to
my
king
Whom
I
with
pain
have
wood
and
won
thereto
And
this
her
easyheld
imprisonment
Hath
gaind
thy
daughter
princely
liberty
Speaks
Suffolk
as
he
thinks
Fair
Margaret
knows
That
Suffolk
doth
not
flatter
face
or
feign
Upon
thy
princely
warrant
I
descend
To
give
thee
answer
of
thy
just
demand
And
here
I
will
expect
thy
coming
Trumpets

Enter
below
Welcome
brave
Earl
into
our
territories
Command
in
Anjou
what
your
Honour
pleases
Thanks
Reignier
happy
for
so
sweet
a
child
Fit
to
be
made
companion
with
a
king
What
answer
makes
your
Grace
unto
my
suit
Since
thou
dost
deign
to
woo
her
little
worth
To
be
the
princely
bride
of
such
a
lord
Upon
condition
I
may
quietly
Enjoy
mine
own
the
country
Maine
and
Anjou
Free
from
oppression
or
the
stroke
of
war
My
daughter
shall
be
Henrys
if
he
please
That
is
her
ransom
I
deliver
her
And
those
two
counties
I
will
undertake
Your
Grace
shall
well
and
quietly
enjoy
And
I

in
Henrys
royal
name
As
deputy
unto
that
gracious
king
Give
thee
her
hand
for
sign
of
plighted
faith
Reignier
of
France
I
give
thee
kingly
thanks
Because
this
is
in
traffic
of
a
king
Aside
And
yet
methinks
I
could
be
well
content
To
be
mine
own
attorney
in
this
case
Ill
over
then
to
England
with
this
news
And
make
this
marriage
to
be
solemnizd
So
farewell
Reignier
Set
this
diamond
safe
In
golden
palaces
as
it
becomes
I
do
embrace
thee
as
I
would
embrace
The
Christian
prince
King
Henry
were
he
here
Farewell
my
lord
Good
wishes
praise
and
prayers
Shall
Suffolk
ever
have
of
Margaret
She
is
going
Farewell
sweet
madam
But
hark
you
Margaret
No
princely
commendations
to
my
king
Such
commendations
as
becomes
a
maid
virgin
and
his
servant
say
to
him
Words
sweetly
placd
and
modestly
directed
But
madam
I
must
trouble
you
again
No
loving
token
to
his
Majesty
Yes
my
good
lord
a
pure
unspotted
heart
Never
yet
taint
with
love
I
send
the
King
And
this
withal
Kisses
her
That
for
thyself
I
will
not
so
presume
To
send
such
peevish
tokens
to
a
king
wert
thou
for
myself
But
Suffolk
stay
Thou
mayst
not
wander
in
that
labyrinth
There
Minotaurs
and
ugly
treasons
lurk
Solicit
Henry
with
her
wondrous
praise
Bethink
thee
on
her
virtues
that
surmount
And
natural
graces
that
extinguish
art
Repeat
their
semblance
often
on
the
seas
That
when
thou
comst
to
kneel
at
Henrys
feet
Thou
mayst
bereave
him
of
his
wits
with

Ah
Joan
this
kills
thy
fathers
heart
outright
Have
I
sought
every
country
far

near
And
now
it
is
my

thee

Must

Ah
Joan
sweet
daughter
Joan
Ill
die

thee
Decrepit

ignoble
wretch
I
am

of

Thou

no

of

Out

My
lords
an
please
you
tis
not

I
did
beget
her
all
the
parish
knows
Her
mother
liveth
yet
can
testify
She
was
the
first
fruit
of
my
bachlorship
Graceless
wilt
thou
deny
thy
parentage
This
argues
what
her
kind
of
life
hath
been
Wicked
and
vile
and
so
her
death
concludes
Fie
Joan
that
thou

gentle
Joan
Peasant
avaunt
You
have
subornd
this
man
Of
purpose
to
obscure
my
noble
birth
Tis
true
I
gave
a
noble
to
the
priest
The
morn
that
I
was
wedded
to
her
mother
Kneel
down
and
take
my
blessing
good
my
girl
Wilt
thou
not

Now
cursed

Of

I
would

Thy
mother
gave
thee
when
thou
suckdst
her
breast
Had
been
a
little
ratsbane
for
thy

Or

when
thou
didst

my

I

some
ravenous
wolf
had

thee
Dost

cursed

Hanging
is

good
Take
her
away
for
she
hath
livd
too
long
To
fill
the
world
with
vicious
qualities
First
let
me
tell
you
whom
you
have
condemnd
Not
me
begotten
of
a
shepherd
swain
But
issued
from
the
progeny
of
kings
Virtuous
and
holy
chosen
from
above
By
inspiration
of
celestial
grace
To
work
exceeding
miracles
on
earth
I
never
had
to
do
with
wicked
spirits
But
you
that
are
polluted
with
your
lusts
Staind
with
the
guiltless
blood
of
innocents
Corrupt
and
tainted
with
a
thousand
vices
Because
you
want
the
grace
that
others
have
You
judge
it
straight
a
thing
impossible
To
compass
wonders
but
by
help
of
devils
No
misconceived
Joan
of
Arc
hath
been
virgin
from
her
tender
infancy
Chaste
and
immaculate
in
very
thought
Whose
maiden
blood
thus
rigorously
effusd
Will
cry
for
vengeance
at
the
gates
of
heaven
Ay
ay
Away
with
her
to
execution
And
hark
ye
sirs
because
she
is
a
maid
Spare
for
no
fagots
let
there
be
enow
Place
barrels
of
pitch
upon
the
fatal
stake
That
so
her
torture
may
be
shortened
Will
nothing
turn
your
unrelenting
hearts
Then
Joan
discover
thine
infirmity
That
warranteth
by
law
to
be
thy
privilege
I
am
with
child
ye
bloody
homicides
Murder
not
then
the
fruit
within
my
womb
Although
ye
hale
me
to
a
violent
death
Now
heaven
forfend
The
holy
maid
with
child
The
greatest
miracle
that
eer
ye
wrought
Is
all
your
strict
preciseness
come
to
this
She
and
the
Dauphin
have
been
juggling
I
did
imagine
what
would
be
her
refuge
Well
go
to
well
have
no
bastards
live
Especially
since
Charles
must
father
it
You
are
deceivd
my
child
is
none
of
his
It
was
Alencon
that
enjoyd
my
love
Alencon
that
notorious
Machiavel
It
dies
an
if
it
had
a
thousand
lives
give
me
leave
I
have
deluded
you
Twas
neither
Charles
nor
yet
the
Duke
I
namd
But
Reignier
King
of
Naples
that
prevaild
married
man
Thats
most
intolerable
Why
heres
a
girl
I
think
she
knows
not
well
There
were
so
manywhom
she
may
accuse
Its
sign
she
hath
been
liberal
and
free
And
yet
forsooth
she
is
a
virgin
pure
Strumpet
thy
words
condemn
thy
brat
and
thee
Use
no
entreaty
for
it
is
in
vain
Then
lead
me
hencewith
whom
I
leave
my
curse
May
never
glorious
sun
reflex
his
beams
Upon
the
country
where
you
make
abode
But
darkness
and
the
gloomy
shade
of
death
Environ
you
till
mischief
and
despair
Drive
you
to
break
your
necks
or
hang
yourselves
Break
thou
in
pieces
and
consume
to
ashes
Thou
foul
accursed
minister
of
hell
Enter
attended
Lord
Regent
I
do
greet
your
Excellence
With
letters
of
commission
from
the
King
For
know
my
lords
the
states
of
Christendom
Movd
with
remorse
of
these
outrageous
broils
Have
earnestly
implord
a
general
peace
Betwixt
our
nation
and
the
aspiring
French
And
here
at
hand
the
Dauphin
and
his
train
Approacheth
to
confer
about
some
matter
Is
all
our
travail
turnd
to
this
effect
After
the
slaughter
of
so
many
peers
So
many
captains
gentlemen
and
soldiers
That
in
this
quarrel
have
been
overthrown
And
sold
their
bodies
for
their
countrys
benefit
Shall
we
at
last
conclude
effeminate
peace
Have
we
not
lost
most
part
of
all
the
towns
By
treason
falsehood
and
by
treachery
Our
great
progenitors
had
conquered
Warwick
Warwick
I
foresee
with
grief
The
utter
loss
of
all
the
realm
of
France
Be
patient
York
If
we
conclude
a
peace
It
shall
be
with
such
strict
and
severe
covenants
As
little
shall
the
Frenchmen
gain
thereby
Enter
and
others
Since
lords
of
England
it
is
thus
agreed
That
peaceful
truce
shall
be
proclaimd
in
France
We
come
to
be
informed
by
yourselves
What
the
conditions
of
that
league
must
be
Speak
Winchester
for
boiling
choler
chokes
The
hollow
passage
of
my
poisond
voice
By
sight
of
these
our
baleful
enemies
Charles
and
the
rest
it
is
enacted
thus
That
in
regard
King
Henry
gives
consent
Of
mere
compassion
and
of
lenity
To
ease
your
country
of
distressful
war
An
suffer
you
to
breathe
in
fruitful
peace
You
shall
become
true
liegemen
to
his
crown
And
Charles
upon
condition
thou
wilt
swear
To
pay
him
tribute
and
submit
thyself
Thou
shalt
be
placd
as
viceroy
under
him
And
still
enjoy
thy
regal
dignity
Must
he
be
then
as
shadow
of
himself
Adorn
his
temples
with
a
coronet
And
yet
in
substance
and
authority
Retain
but
privilege
of
a
private
man
This
proffer
is
absurd
and
reasonless
Tis
known
already
that
I
am
possessd
With
more
than
half
the
Gallian
territories
And
therein
reverencd
for
their
lawful
king
Shall
I
for
lucre
of
the
rest
unvanquishd
Detract
so
much
from
that
prerogative
As
to
be
calld
but
viceroy
of
the
whole
No
Lord
Ambassador
Ill
rather
keep
That
which
I
have
than
coveting
for
more
Be
cast
from
possibility
of
all
Insulting
Charles
Hast
thou
by
secret
means
Usd
intercession
to
obtain
a
league
And
now
the
matter
grows
to
compromise
Standst
thou
aloof
upon
comparison
Either
accept
the
title
thou
usurpst
Of
benefit
proceeding
from
our
king
And
not
of
any
challenge
of
desert
Or
we
will
plague
thee
with
incessant
wars
To
My
lord
you
do
not
well
in
obstinacy
To
cavil
in
the
course
of
this
contract
If
once
it
be
neglected
ten
to
one
We
shall
not
find
like
opportunity
To
To
say
the
truth
it
is
your
policy
To
save
your
subjects
from
such
massacre
And
ruthless
slaughters
as
are
daily
seen
By
our
proceeding
in
hostility
And
therefore
take
this
compact
of
a
truce
Although
you
break
it
when
your
pleasure
serves
How
sayst
thou
Charles
Shall
our
condition
stand
It
shall
Only
reservd
you
claim
no
interest
In
any
of
our
towns
of
garrison
Then
swear
allegiance
to
his
Majesty
As
thou
art
knight
never
to
disobey
Nor
be
rebellious
to
the
crown
of
England
Thou
nor
thy
nobles
to
the
crown
of
England
and
the
rest
give
tokens
of
fealty
So
now
dismiss
your
army
when
ye
please
Hang
up
your
ensigns
let
your
drums
be
still
For
here
we
entertain
a
solemn
peace
London
The
palace
Enter
in
conference
with
the
and
Your
wondrous
rare
description
noble
Earl
Of
beauteous
Margaret
hath
astonishd
me
Her
virtues
graced
with
external
gifts
Do
breed
loves
settled
passions
in
my
heart
And
like
as
rigour
of
tempestuous
gusts
Provokes
the
mightiest
hulk
against
the
tide
So
am
I
driven
by
breath
of
her
renown
Either
to
suffer
shipwreck
or
arrive
Where
I
may
have
fruition
of
her
love
Tush
my
good
lord
This
superficial
tale
Is
but
a
preface
of
her
worthy
praise
The
chief
perfections
of
that
lovely
dame
Had
I
sufficient
skill
to
utter
them
Would
make
a
volume
of
enticing
lines
Able
to
ravish
any
dull
conceit
And
which
is
more
she
is
not
so
divine
So
fullreplete
with
choice
of
all
delights
But
with
as
humble
lowliness
of
mind
She
is
content
to
be
at
your
command
Command
I
mean
of
virtuous
intents
To
love
and
honour
Henry
as
her
lord
And
otherwise
will
Henry
neer
presume
Therefore
my
Lord
Protector
give
consent
That
Margaret
may
be
Englands
royal
Queen
So
should
I
give
consent
to
flatter
sin
You
know
my
lord
your
Highness
is
betrothd
Unto
another
lady
of
esteem
How
shall
we
then
dispense
with
that
contract
And
not
deface
your
honour
with
reproach
As
doth
a
ruler
with
unlawful
oaths
Or
one
that
at
a
triumph
having
vowd
To
try
his
strength
forsaketh
yet
the
lists
By
reason
of
his
adversarys
odds
poor
earls
daughter
is
unequal
odds
And
therefore
may
be
broke
without
offence
Why
what
I
pray
is
Margaret
more
than
that
Her
father
is
no
better
than
an
earl
Although
in
glorious
titles
he
excel
Yes
my
lord
her
father
is
a
king
The
King
of
Naples
and
Jerusalem
And
of
such
great
authority
in
France
As
his
alliance
will
confirm
our
peace
And
keep
the
Frenchmen
in
allegiance
And
so
the
Earl
of
Armagnac
may
do
Because
he
is
near
kinsman
unto
Charles
Beside
his
wealth
doth
warrant
a
liberal
dower
Where
Reignier
sooner
will
receive
than
give
dowr
my
lords
Disgrace
not
so
your
king
That
he
should
be
so
abject
base
and
poor
To
choose
for
wealth
and
not
for
perfect
love
Henry
is
able
to
enrich
his
queen
And
not
to
seek
a
queen
to
make
him
rich
So
worthless
peasants
bargain
for
their
wives
As
marketmen
for
oxen
sheep
or
horse
Marriage
is
a
matter
of
more
worth
Than
to
be
dealt
in
by
attorneyship
Not
whom
we
will
but
whom
his
Grace
affects
Must
be
companion
of
his
nuptial
bed
And
therefore
lords
since
he
affects
her
most
It
most
of
all
these
reasons
bindeth
us
In
our
opinions
she
should
be
preferrd
For
what
is
wedlock
forced
but
a
hell
An
age
of
discord
and
continual
strife
Whereas
the
contrary
bringeth
bliss
And
is
a
pattern
of
celestial
peace
Whom
should
we
match
with
Henry
being
a
king
But
Margaret
that
is
daughter
to
a
king
Her
peerless
feature
joined
with
her
birth
Approves
her
fit
for
none
but
for
a
king
Her
valiant
courage
and
undaunted
spirit
More
than
in
women
commonly
is
seen
Will
answer
our
hope
in
issue
of
a
king
For
Henry
son
unto
a
conqueror
Is
likely
to
beget
more
conquerors
If
with
a
lady
of
so
high
resolve
As
is
fair
Margaret
he
be
linkd
in
love
Then
yield
my
lords
and
here
conclude
with
me
That
Margaret
shall
be
Queen
and
none
but
she
Whether
it
be
through
force
of
your
report
My
noble
Lord
of
Suffolk
or
for
that
My
tender
youth
was
never
yet
attaint
With
any
passion
of
inflaming
love
I
cannot
tell
but
this
I
am
assurd
I
feel
such
sharp
dissension
in
my
breast
Such
fierce
alarums
both
of
hope
and
fear
As
I
am
sick
with
working
of
my
thoughts
Take
therefore
shipping
post
my
lord
to
France
Agree
to
any
covenants
and
procure
That
Lady
Margaret
do
vouchsafe
to
come
To
cross
the
seas
to
England
and
be
crownd
King
Henrys
faithful
and
anointed
queen
For
your
expenses
and
sufficient
charge
Among
the
people
gather
up
a
tenth
Be
gone
I
say
for
till
you
do
return
I
rest
perplexed
with
a
thousand
cares
And
you
good
uncle
banish
all
offence
If
you
do
censure
me
by
what
you
were
Not
what
you
are
I
know
it
will
excuse
This
sudden
execution
of
my
will
And
so
conduct
me
where
from
company
I
may
revolve
and
ruminate
my
grief
Ay
grief
I
fear
me
both
at
first
and
last
Thus
Suffolk
hath
prevaild
and
thus
he
goes
As
did
the
youthful
Paris
once
to
Greece
With
hope
to
find
the
like
event
in
love
But
prosper
better
than
the
Troyan
did
Margaret
shall
now
be
Queen
and
rule
the
King
But
I
will
rule
both
her

King

In

With

minister
Her

ravish

her

Her

Makes

eighteen
months
Be
full
expird
Thanks
uncle
Winchester
Gloucester
York
Buckingham
Somerset
Salisbury
and
Warwick
We
thank
you
all
for
this
great
favour
done
In
entertainment
to
my
princely
queen
Come
let
us
in
and
with
all
speed
provide
To
see
her
coronation
be
performd
Brave
peers
of
England
pillars
of
the
state
To
you
Duke
Humphrey
must
unload
his
grief
Your
grief
the
common
grief
of
all
the
land
What
did
my
brother
Henry
spend
his
youth
His
valour
coin
and
people
in
the
wars
Did
he
so
often
lodge
in
open
field
In
winters
cold
and
summers
parching
heat
To
conquer
France
his
true
inheritance
And
did
my
brother
Bedford
toil
his
wits
To
keep
by
policy
what
Henry
got
Have
you
yourselves
Somerset
Buckingham
Brave
York
Salisbury
and
victorious
Warwick
Receivd
deep
scars
in
France
and
Normandy
Or
hath
mine
uncle
Beaufort
and
myself
With
all
the
learned
Council
of
the
realm
Studied
so
long
sat
in
the
Council
House
Early
and
late
debating
to
and
fro
How
France
and
Frenchmen
might
be
kept
in
awe
And
had
his
Highness
in
his
infancy
Crowned
in
Paris
in
despite
of
foes
And
shall
these
labours
and
these
honours
die
Shall
Henrys
conquest
Bedfords
vigilance
Your
deeds
of
war
and
all
our
counsel
die
peers
of
England
shameful
is
this
league
Fatal
this
marriage
cancelling
your
fame
Blotting
your
names
from
books
of
memory
Razing
the
characters
of
your
renown
Defacing
monuments
of
conquerd
France
Undoing
all
as
all
had
never
been
Nephew
what
means
this
passionate
discourse
This
peroration
with
such
circumstance
For
France
tis
ours
and
we
will
keep
it
still
Ay
uncle
we
will
keep
it
if
we
can
But
now
it
is
impossible
we
should
Suffolk
the
newmade
duke
that
rules
the
roast
Hath
given
the
duchy
of
Anjou
and
Maine
Unto
the
poor
King
Reignier
whose
large
style
Agrees
not
with
the
leanness
of
his
purse
Now
by
the
death
of
Him
that
died
for
all
These
counties
were
the
keys
of
Normandy
But
wherefore
weeps
Warwick
my
valiant
son
For
grief
that
they
are
past
recovery
For
were
there
hope
to
conquer
them
again
My
sword
should
shed
hot
blood
mine
eyes
no
tears
Anjou
and
Maine
myself
did
win
them
both
Those
provinces
these
arms
of
mine
did
conquer
And
are
the
cities
that
I
got
with
wounds
Deliverd
up
again
with
peaceful
words
Mort
Dieu
For
Suffolks
duke
may
he
be
suffocate
That
dims
the
honour
of
this
warlike
isle
France
should
have
torn
and
rent
my
very
heart
Before
I
would
have
yielded
to
this
league
I
never
read
but
Englands
kings
have
had
Large
sums
of
gold
and
dowries
with
their
wives
And
our
King
Henry
gives
away
his
own
To
match
with
her
that
brings
no
vantages
proper
jest
and
never
heard
before
That
Suffolk
should
demand
a
whole
fifteenth
For
costs
and
charges
in
transporting
her
She
should
have
stayd
in
France
and
starvd
in
France
Before
My
Lord
of
Gloucester
now
ye
grow
too
hot
It
was
the
pleasure
of
my
lord
the
King
My
Lord
of
Winchester
I
know
your
mind
Tis
not
my
speeches
that
you
do
mislike
But
tis
my
presence
that
doth
trouble
ye
Rancour
will
out
proud
prelate
in
thy
face
I
see
thy
fury
if
I
longer
stay
We
shall
begin
our
ancient
bickerings
Lordings
farewell
and
say
when
I
am
gone
I
prophesied
France
will
be
lost
ere
long
So
there
goes
our
Protector
in
a
rage
Tis
known
to
you
he
is
mine
enemy
Nay
more
an
enemy
unto
you
all
And
no
great
friend
I
fear
me
to
the
King
Consider
lords
he
is
the
next
of
blood
And
heir
apparent
to
the
English
crown
Had
Henry
got
an
empire
by
his
marriage
And
all
the
wealthy
kingdoms
of
the
west
Theres
reason
he
should
be
displeasd
at
it
Look
to
it
lords
let
not
his
smoothing
words
Bewitch
your
hearts
be
wise
and
circumspect
What
though
the
common
people
favour
him
Calling
him
Humphrey
the
good
Duke
of
Gloucester
Clapping
their
hands
and
crying
with
loud
voice
Jesu
maintain
your
royal
excellence
With
God
preserve
the
good
Duke
Humphrey
I
fear
me
lords
for
all
this
flattering
gloss
He
will
be
found
a
dangerous
Protector
Why
should
he
then
protect
our
sovereign
He
being
of
age
to
govern
of
himself
Cousin
of
Somerset
join
you
with
me
And
all
together
with
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
Well
quickly
hoise
Duke
Humphrey
from
his
seat
This
weighty
business
will
not
brook
delay
Ill
to
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
presently
Cousin
of
Buckingham
though
Humphreys
pride
And
greatness
of
his
place
be
grief
to
us
Yet
let
us
watch
the
haughty
cardinal
His
insolence
is
more
intolerable
Than
all
the
princes
in
the
land
beside
If
Gloucester
be
displacd
hell
be
Protector
Or
thou
or
I
Somerset
will
be
Protector
Despite
Duke
Humphrey
or
the
Cardinal
Pride
went
before
ambition
follows
him
While
these
do
labour
for
their
own
preferment
Behoves
it
us
to
labour
for
the
realm
I
never
saw
but
Humphrey
Duke
of
Gloucester
Did
bear
him
like
a
noble
gentleman
Oft
have
I
seen
the
haughty
Cardinal
More
like
a
soldier
than
a
man
o
th
church
As
stout
and
proud
as
he
were
lord
of
all
Swear
like
a
ruffian
and
demean
himself
Unlike
the
ruler
of
a
commonweal
Warwick
my
son
the
comfort
of
my
age
Thy
deeds
thy
plainness
and
thy
housekeeping
Hath
won
the
greatest
favour
of
the
commons
Excepting
none
but
good
Duke
Humphrey
And
brother
York
thy
acts
in
Ireland
In
bringing
them
to
civil
discipline
Thy
late
exploits
done
in
the
heart
of
France
When
thou
wert
Regent
for
our
sovereign
Have
made
thee
feard
and
honourd
of
the
people
Join
we
together
for
the
public
good
In
what
we
can
to
bridle
and
suppress
The
pride
of
Suffolk
and
the
Cardinal
With
Somersets
and
Buckinghams
ambition
And
as
we
may
cherish
Duke
Humphreys
deeds
While
they
do
tend
the
profit
of
the
land
So
God
help
Warwick
as
he
loves
the
land
And
common
profit
of
his
country
And
so
says
York
Aside
for
he
hath
greatest
cause
Then
lets
make
haste
away
and
look
unto
the
main
Unto
the
main
father
Maine
is
lost
That
Maine
which
by
main
force
Warwick
did
win
And
would
have
kept
so
long
as
breath
did
last
Main
chance
father
you
meant
but
I
meant
Maine
Which
I
will
win
from
France
or
else
be
slain
Anjou
and
Maine
are
given
to
the
French
Paris
is
lost
the
state
of
Normandy
Stands
on
a
tickle
point
now
they
are
gone
Suffolk
concluded
on
the
articles
The
peers
agreed
and
Henry
was
well
pleasd
To
changes
two
dukedoms
for
a
dukes
fair
daughter
I
cannot
blame
them
all
what
ist
to
them
Tis
thine
they
give
away
and
not
their
own
Pirates
may
make
cheap
pennyworths
of
their
pillage
And
purchase
friends
and
give
to
courtezans
Still
revelling
like
lords
till
all
be
gone
While
as
the
silly
owner
of
the
goods
Weeps
over
them
and
wrings
his
hapless
hands
And
shakes
his
head
and
trembling
stands
aloof
While
all
is
shard
and
all
is
borne
away
Ready
to
starve
and
dare
not
touch
his
own
So
York
must
sit
and
fret
and
bite
his
tongue
While
his
own
lands
are
bargaind
for
and
sold
Methinks
the
realms
of
England
France
and
Ireland
Bear
that
proportion
to
my
flesh
and
blood
As
did
the
fatal
brand
Althaea
burnt
Unto
the
princes
heart
of
Calydon
Anjou
and
Maine
both
given
unto
the
French
Cold
news
for
me
for
I
had
hope
of
France
Even
as
I
have
of
fertile
Englands
soil
day
will
come
when
York
shall
claim
his
own
And
therefore
I
will
take
the
Nevils
parts
And
make
a
show
of
love
to
proud
Duke
Humphrey
And
when
I
spy
advantage
claim
the
crown
For
thats
the
golden
mark
I
seek
to
hit
Nor
shall
proud
Lancaster
usurp
my
right
Nor
hold
the
sceptre
in
his
childish
fist
Nor
wear
the
diadem
upon
his
head
Whose
churchlike
humours
fits
not
for
a
crown
Then
York
be
still
awhile
till
time
do
serve
Watch
thou
and
wake
when
others
be
asleep
To
pry
into
the
secrets
of
the
state
Till
Henry
surfeiting
in
joys
of
love
With
his
new
bride
and
Englands
dearbought
queen
And
Humphrey
with
the
peers
be
falln
at
jars
Then
will
I
raise
aloft
the
milkwhite
rose
With
whose
sweet
smell
the
air
shall
be
perfumd
And
in
my
standard
bear
the
arms
of
York
To
grapple
with
the
house
of
Lancaster
And
force
perforce
Ill
make
him
yield
the
crown
Whose
bookish
rule
hath
pulld
fair
England
down
My
masters
lets
stand
close
my
Lord
Protector
will
come
this
way
by
and
by
and
then
we
may
deliver
our
supplications
in
the
quill
Marry
the
Lord
protect
him
for
hes
a
good
man
Jesu
bless
him
Enter
and
Here
a
comes
methinks
and
the
Queen
with
him
Ill
be
the
first
sure
Come
back
fool
this
is
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
and
not
my
Lord
Protector
How
now
fellow
Wouldst
anything
with
me
I
pray
my
lord
pardon
me
I
took
ye
for
my
Lord
Protector
Reads
To
my
Lord
Protector
Are
your
supplications
to
his
lordship
Let
me
see
them
What
is
thine
Mine
is
ant
please
your
Grace
against
John
Goodman
my
Lord
Cardinals
man
for
keeping
my
house
and
lands
and
wife
and
all
from
me
Thy
wife
too
Thats
some
wrong
indeed
Whats
yours
Whats
here
Reads
Against
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
for
enclosing
the
commons
of
Melford
How
now
sir
knave
Alas
sir
I
am
but
a
poor
petitioner
of
our
whole
township
Presenting
his
petition
Against
my
master
Thomas
Horner
for
saying
that
the
Duke
of
York
was
rightful
heir
to
the
crown
What
sayst
thou
Did
the
Duke
of
York
say
he
was
rightful
heir
to
the
crown
That
my
master
was
No
forsooth
My
master
said
that
he
was
and
that
the
King
was
an
usurper
Who
is
there
Enter
servant
Take
this
fellow
in
and
send
for
his
master
with
a
pursuivant
presently
Well
hear
more
of
your
matter
before
the
King
And
as
for
you
that
love
to
be
protected
Under
the
wings
of
our
Protectors
grace
Begin
your
suits
anew
and
sue
to
him
Tears
the
supplications
Away
base
cullions
Suffolk
let
them
go
Come
lets
be
gone
My
Lord
of
Suffolk
say
is
this
the
guise
Is
this
the
fashions
in
the
court
of
England
Is
this
the
government
of
Britains
isle
And
this
the
royalty
of
Albions
king
What
shall
King
Henry
be
a
pupil
still
Under
the
surly
Gloucesters
governance
Am
I
a
queen
in
title
and
in
style
And
must
be
made
a
subject
to
a
duke
I
tell
thee
Pole
when
in
the
city
Tours
Thou
ranst
a
tilt
in
honour
of
my
love
And
stolst
away
the
ladies
hearts
of
France
I
thought
King
Henry
had
resembled
thee
In
courage
courtship
and
proportion
But
all
his
mind
is
bent
to
holiness
To
number
AveMaries
on
his
beads
His
champions
are
the
prophets
and
apostles
His
weapons
holy
saws
of
sacred
writ
His
study
is
his
tiltyard
and
his
loves
Are
brazen
images
of
canonized
saints
I
would
the
college
of
the
Cardinals
Would
choose
him
Pope
and
carry
him
to
Rome
And
set
the
triple
crown
upon
his
head
That
were
a
state
fit
for
his
holiness
Madam
be
patient
As
I
was
cause
Your
Highness
came
to
England
so
will
I
In
England
work
your
Graces
full
content
Beside
the
haughty
Protector
have
we
Beaufort
The
imperious
churchman
Somerset
Buckingham
And
grumbling
York
and
not
the
least
of
these
But
can
do
more
in
England
than
the
King
And
he
of
these
that
can
do
most
of
all
Cannot
do
more
in
England
than
the
Nevils
Salisbury
and
Warwick
are
no
simple
peers
Not
all
these
lords
do
vex
me
half
so
much
As
that
proud
dame
the
Lord
Protectors
wife
She
sweeps
it
through
the
court
with
troops
of
ladies
More
like
an
empress
than
Duke
Humphreys
wife
Strangers
in
court
do
take
her
for
the
Queen
She
bears
a
dukes
revenues
on
her
back
And
in
her
heart
she
scorns
our
poverty
Shall
I
not
live
to
be
avengd
on
her
Contemptuous
baseborn
callet
as
she
is
She
vaunted
mongst
her
minions
t
other
day
The
very
train
of
her
worst
wearing
gown
Was
better
worth
than
all
my
fathers
lands
Till
Suffolk
gave
two
dukedoms
for
his
daughter
Madam
myself
have
limd
a
bush
for
her
And
placd
a
quire
of
such
enticing
birds
That
she
will
light
to
listen
to
the
lays
And
never
mount
to
trouble
you
again
So
let
her
rest
And
madam
list
to
me
For
I
am
bold
to
counsel
you
in
this
Although
we
fancy
not
the
Cardinal
Yet
must
we
join
with
him
and
with
the
lords
Till
we
have
brought
Duke
Humphrey
in
disgrace
As
for
the
Duke
of
York
this
late
complaint
Will
make
but
little
for
his
benefit
So
one
by
one
well
weed
them
all
at
last
And
you
yourself
shall
steer
the
happy
helm
Sound
a
sennet
Enter
the
and
the
For
my
part
noble
lords
I
care
not
which
Or
Somerset
or
York
alls
one
to
me
If
York
have
ill
demeand
himself
in
France
Then
let
him
be
denayd
the
regentship
If
Somerset
be
unworthy
of
the
place
Let
York
be
Regent
I
will
yield
to
him
Whether
your
Grace
be
worthy
yea
or
no
Dispute
not
that
York
is
the
worthier
Ambitious
Warwick
let
thy
betters
speak
The
Cardinals
not
my
better
in
the
field
All
in
this
presence
are
thy
betters
Warwick
Warwick
may
live
to
be
the
best
of
all
Peace
son
And
show
some
reason
Buckingham
Why
Somerset
should
be
preferrd
in
this
Because
the
King
forsooth
will
have
it
so
Madam
the
King
is
old
enough
himself
To
give
his
censure
These
are
no
womens
matters
If
he
be
old
enough
what
needs
your
Grace
To
be
Protector
of
his
Excellence
Madam
I
am
Protector
of
the
realm
And
at
his
pleasure
will
resign
my
place
Resign
it
then
and
leave
thine
insolence
Since
thou
wert
king
as
who
is
king
but
thou
The
commonwealth
hath
daily
run
to
wrack
The
Dauphin
hath
prevaild
beyond
the
seas
And
all
the
peers
and
nobles
of
the
realm
Have
been
as
bondmen
to
thy
sovereignty
The
commons
hast
thou
rackd
the
clergys
bags
Are
lank
and
lean
with
thy
extortions
Thy
sumptuous
buildings
and
thy
wifes
attire
Have
cost
a
mass
of
public
treasury
Thy
cruelty
in
execution
Upon
offenders
hath
exceeded
law
And
left
thee
to
the
mercy
of
the
law
Thy
sale
of
offices
and
towns
in
France
If
they
were
known
as
the
suspect
is
great
Would
make
thee
quickly
hop
without
thy
head
Give
me
my
fan
What
minion
can
ye
not
She
gives
the
a
box
on
the
ear
I
cry
your
mercy
madam
was
it
you
Wast
I
Yea
I
it
was
proud
Frenchwoman
Could
I
come
near
your
beauty
with
my
nails
I
could
set
my
ten
commandments
in
your
face
Sweet
aunt
be
quiet
twas
against
her
will
Against
her
will
good
King
Look
to
t
in
time
Shell
hamper
thee
and
dandle
thee
like
a
baby
Though
in
this
place
most
master
wear
no
breeches
She
shall
not
strike
Dame
Eleanor
unrevengd
Lord
Cardinal
I
will
follow
Eleanor
And
listen
after
Humphrey
how
he
proceeds
Shes
tickled
now
her
fume
needs
no
spurs
Shell
gallop
far
enough
to
her
destruction
Reenter
Now
lords
my
choler
being
overblown
With
walking
once
about
the
quadrangle
I
come
to
talk
of
commonwealth
affairs
As
for
your
spiteful
false
objections
Prove
them
and
I
lie
open
to
the
law
But
God
in
mercy
so
deal
with
my
soul
As
I
in
duty
love
my
king
and
country
But
to
the
matter
that
we
have
in
hand
I
say
my
sovereign
York
is
meetest
man
To
be
your
Regent
in
the
realm
of
France
Before
we
make
election
give
me
leave
To
show
some
reason
of
no
little
force
That
York
is
most
unmeet
of
any
man
Ill
tell
thee
Suffolk
why
I
am
unmeet
First
for
I
cannot
flatter
thee
in
pride
Next
if
I
be
appointed
for
the
place
My
Lord
of
Somerset
will
keep
me
here
Without
discharge
money
or
furniture
Till
France
be
won
into
the
Dauphins
hands
Last
time
I
dancd
attendance
on
his
will
Till
Paris
was
besiegd
famishd
and
lost
That
can
I
witness
and
a
fouler
fact
Did
never
traitor
in
the
land
commit
Peace
headstrong
Warwick
Image
of
pride
why
should
I
hold
my
peace
Enter
the
Armourer
and
his
man
guarded
Because
here
is
a
man
accusd
of
treason
Pray
God
the
Duke
of
York
excuse
himself
Doth
any
one
accuse
York
for
a
traitor
What
meanst
thou
Suffolk
Tell
me
what
are
these
Please
it
your
Majesty
this
is
the
man
That
doth
accuse
his
master
of
high
treason
His
words
were
these
that
Richard
Duke
of
York
Was
rightful
heir
unto
the
English
crown
And
that
your
Majesty
was
an
usurper
Say
man
were
these
thy
words
Ant
shall
please
your
Majesty
I
never
said
nor
thought
any
such
matter
God
is
my
witness
I
am
falsely
accusd
by
the
villain
Holding
up
his
hands
By
these
ten
bones
my
lords
he
did
speak
them
to
me
in
the
garret
one
night
as
we
were
scouring
my
Lord
of
Yorks
armour
Base
dunghill
villain
and
mechanical
Ill
have
thy
head
for
this
thy
traitors
speech
I
do
beseech
your
royal
Majesty
Let
him
have
all
the
rigour
of
the
law
Alas
my
lord
hang
me
if
ever
I
spake
the
words
My
accuser
is
my
prentice
and
when
I
did
correct
him
for
his
fault
the
other
day
he
did
vow
upon
his
knees
he
would
be
even
with
me
I
have
good
witness
of
this
therefore
I
beseech
your
Majesty
do
not
cast
away
an
honest
man
for
a
villains
accusation
Uncle
what
shall
we
say
to
this
in
law
This
doom
my
lord
if
I
may
judge
Let
Somerset
be
Regent
oer
the
French
Because
in
York
this
breeds
suspicion
And
let
these
have
a
day
appointed
them
For
single
combat
in
convenient
place
For
he
hath
witness
of
his
servants
malice
This
is
the
law
and
this
Duke
Humphreys
doom
I
humbly
thank
your
royal
Majesty
And
I
accept
the
combat
willingly
Alas
my
lord
I
cannot
fight
for
Gods
sake
pity
my
case
The
spite
of
man
prevaileth
against
me
Lord
have
mercy
upon
me
I
shall
never
be
able
to
fight
a
blow
Lord
my
heart
Sirrah
or
you
must
fight
or
else
be
hangd
Away
with
them
to
prison
and
the
day
of
combat
shall
be
the
last
of
the
next
month
Come
Somerset
well
see
thee
sent
away
Flourish
Now
my
good
Lords
of
Salisbury
and
Warwick
Our
simple
supper
ended
give
me
leave
In
this
close
walk
to
satisfy
myself
In
craving
your
opinion
of
my
tide
Which
is
infallible
to
Englands
crown
My
lord
I
long
to
hear
it
at
full
Sweet
York
begin
and
if
thy
claim
be
good
The
Nevils
are
thy
subjects
to
command
Then
thus
Edward
the
Third
my
lords
had
seven
sons
The
first
Edward
the
Black
Prince
Prince
of
Wales
The
second
William
of
Hatfield
and
the
third
Lionel
Duke
of
Clarence
next
to
whom
Was
John
of
Gaunt
the
Duke
of
Lancaster
The
fifth
was
Edmund
Langley
Duke
of
York
The
sixth
was
Thomas
of
Woodstock
Duke
of
Gloucester
William
of
Windsor
was
the
seventh
and
last
Edward
the
Black
Prince
died
before
his
father
And
left
behind
him
Richard
his
only
son
Who
after
Edward
the
Thirds
death
reignd
as
king
Till
Henry
Bolingbroke
Duke
of
Lancaster
The
eldest
son
and
heir
of
John
of
Gaunt
Crownd
by
the
name
of
Henry
the
Fourth
Seizd
on
the
realm
deposd
the
rightful
king
Sent
his
poor
queen
to
France
from
whence
she
came
And
him
to
Pomfret
where
as
all
you
know
Harmless
Richard
was
murdered
traitorously
Father
the
Duke
hath
told
the
truth
Thus
got
the
house
of
Lancaster
the
crown
Which
now
they
hold
by
force
and
not
by
right
For
Richard
the
first
sons
heir
being
dead
The
issue
of
the
next
son
should
have
reignd
But
William
of
Hatfield
died
without
an
heir
The
third
son
Duke
of
Clarence
from
whose
line
I
claim
the
crown
had
issue
Philippe
a
daughter
Who
married
Edmund
Mortimer
Earl
of
March
Edmund
had
issue
Roger
Earl
of
March
Roger
had
issue
Edmund
Anne
and
Eleanor
This
Edmund
in
the
reign
of
Bolingbroke
As
I
have
read
laid
claim
unto
the
crown
And
but
for
Owen
Glendower
had
been
king
Who
kept
him
in
captivity
till
he
died
But
to
the
rest
His
eldest
sister
Anne
My
mother
being
heir
unto
the
crown
Married
Richard
Earl
of
Cambridge
who
was
To
Edmund
Langley
Edward
the
Thirds
fifth
son
son
By
her
I
claim
the
kingdom
she
was
heir
To
Roger
Earl
of
March
who
was
the
son
Of
Edmund
Mortimer
who
married
Philippe
Sole
daughter
unto
Lionel
Duke
of
Clarence
So
if
the
issue
of
the
elder
son
Succeed
before
the
younger
I
am
King
What
plain
proceedings
is
more
plain
than
this
Henry
doth
claim
the
crown
from
John
of
Gaunt
The
fourth
son
York
claims
it
from
the
third
Till
Lionels
issue
fails
his
should
not
reign
It
fails
not
yet
but
flourishes
in
thee
And
in
thy
sons
fair
slips
of
such
a
stock
Then
father
Salisbury
kneel
we
together
And
in
this
private
plot
be
we
the
first
That
shall
salute
our
rightful
sovereign
With
honour
of
his
birthright
to
the
crown
Long
live
our
sovereign
Richard
Englands
King
We
thank
you
lords
But
I
am
not
your
king
Till
I
be
crownd
and
that
my
sword
be
staind
With
heartblood
of
the
house
of
Lancaster
And
thats
not
suddenly
to
be
performd
But
with
advice
and
silent
secrecy
Do
you
as
I
do
in
these
dangerous
days
Wink
at
the
Duke
of
Suffolks
insolence
At
Beauforts
pride
at
Somersets
ambition
At
Buckingham
and
all
the
crew
of
them
Till
they
have
snard
the
shepherd
of
the
flock
That
virtuous
prince
the
good
Duke
Humphrey
Tis
that
they
seek
and
they
in
seeking
that
Shall
find
their
deaths
if
York
can
prophesy
My
lord
break
we
off
we
know
your
mind
at
full
My
heart
assures
me
that
the
Earl
of
Warwick
Shall
one
day
make
the
Duke
of
York
a
king
And
Nevil
this
I
do
assure
myself
Richard
shall
live
to
make
the
Earl
of
Warwick
The
greatest
man
in
England
but
the
King
Thus
sometimes
hath
the
brightest
day
a
cloud
And
after
summer
evermore
succeeds
Barren
winter
with
his
wrathful
nipping
cold
So
cares
and
joys
abound
as
seasons
fleet
Sirs
whats
oclock
Ten
my
lord
Ten
is
the
hour
that
was
appointed
me
To
watch
the
coming
of
my
punishd
duchess
Uneath
may
she
endure
the
flinty
streets
To
tread
them
with
her
tenderfeeling
feet
Sweet
Nell
ill
can
thy
noble
mind
abrook
The
abject
people
gazing
on
thy
face
With
envious
looks
laughing
at
thy
shame
That
erst
did
follow
thy
proud
chariot
wheels
When
thou
didst
ride
in
triumph
through
the
streets
But
soft
I
think
she
comes
and
Ill
prepare
My
tearstaind
eyes
to
see
her
miseries
Enter
the
in
a
white
sheet
and
a
taper
burning
in
her
hand
with
the
and
So
please
your
Grace
well
take
her
from
the
sheriff
No
stir
not
for
your
lives
let
her
pass
by
Come
you
my
lord
to
see
my
open
shame
Now
thou
dost
penance
too
Look
how
they
gaze
See
how
the
giddy
multitude
do
point
And
nod
their
heads
and
throw
their
eyes
on
thee
Ah
Gloucester
hide
thee
from
their
hateful
looks
And
in
thy
closet
pent
up
rue
my
shame
And
ban
thine
enemies
both
mine
and
thine
Be
patient
gentle
Nell
forget
this
grief
Ah
Gloucester
teach
me
to
forget
myself
For
whilst
I
think
I
am
thy
married
wife
And
thou
a
prince
Protector
of
this
land
Methinks
I
should
not
thus
be
led
along
Maild
up
in
shame
with
papers
on
my
back
And
followd
with
a
rabble
that
rejoice
To
see
my
tears
and
hear
my
deepfet
groans
The
ruthless
flint
doth
cut
my
tender
feet
And
when
I
start
the
envious
people
laugh
And
bid
me
be
advised
how
I
tread
Ah
Humphrey
can
I
bear
this
shameful
yoke
Trowest
thou
that
eer
Ill
look
upon
the
world
Or
count
them
happy
that
enjoy
the
sun
No
dark
shall
be
my
light
and
night
my
day
To
think
upon
my
pomp
shall
be
my
hell
Sometimes
Ill
say
I
am
Duke
Humphreys
wife
And
he
a
prince
and
ruler
of
the
land
Yet
so
he
ruld
and
such
a
prince
he
was
As
he
stood
by
whilst
I
his
forlorn
duchess
Was
made
a
wonder
and
a
pointingstock
To
every
idle
rascal
follower
But
be
thou
mild
and
blush
not
at
my
shame
Nor
stir
at
nothing
till
the
axe
of
death
Hang
over
thee
as
sure
it
shortly
will
For
Suffolk
he
that
can
do
all
in
all
With
her
that
hateth
thee
and
hates
us
all
And
York
and
impious
Beaufort
that
false
priest
Have
all
limd
bushes
to
betray
thy
wings
And
fly
thou
how
thou
canst
theyll
tangle
thee
But
fear
not
thou
until
thy
foot
be
snard
Nor
never
seek
prevention
of
thy
foes
Ah
Nell
forbear
Thou
aimest
all
awry
I
must
offend
before
I
be
attainted
And
had
I
twenty
times
so
many
foes
And
each
of
them
had
twenty
times
their
power
All
these
could
not
procure
me
any
scathe
So
long
as
I
am
loyal
true
and
crimeless
Wouldst
have
me
rescue
thee
from
this
reproach
Why
yet
thy
scandal
were
not
wipd
away
But
I
in
danger
for
the
breach
of
law
Thy
greatest
help
is
quiet
gentle
Nell
I
pray
thee
sort
thy
heart
to
patience
These
few
days
wonder
will
be
quickly
worn
Enter

All

For
none
abides
with

My
joy
is

Death

I
oft
have
been
afeard
Because
I
wishd
this
worlds
eternity
Stanley
I

and
take

Only

Why

to
the
Isle
of
Man
There
to

usd
according
to
your
state
Thats
bad
enough
for
I
am
but

And
shall

reproachfully
Like
to
a
duchess
and
Duke
Humphreys
lady
According
to
that
state
you

be
usd
Sheriff

Although

It
is
my
office
and
madam

Ay

dischargd
Come
Stanley
shall
we
go
Madam
your
penance
done
throw
off
this
sheet
And
go
we
to
attire
you
for
our
journey
My
shame
will
not
be
shifted
with
my
sheet
No
it
will
hang
upon
my
richest
robes
And
show
itself
attire
me
how
I
can
Go
lead
the
way
I
long
to
see
my
prison
I
The
Abbey
at
Bury
St
Edmunds
Sound
a
sennet
Enter
the
the
and
to
the
Parliament
I
muse
my
Lord
of
Gloucester
is
not
come
Tis
not
his
wont
to
be
the
hindmost
man
Whateer
occasion
keeps
him
from
us
now
Can
you
not
see
or
will
ye
not
observe
The
strangeness
of
his
alterd
countenance
With
what
a
majesty
he
bears
himself
How
insolent
of
late
he
is
become
How
proud
how
peremptory
and
unlike
himself
We
know
the
time
since
he
was
mild
and
affable
And
if
we
did
but
glance
a
faroff
look
Immediately
he
was
upon
his
knee
That
all
the
court
admird
him
for
submission
But
meet
him
now
and
be
it
in
the
morn
When
every
one
will
give
the
time
of
day
He
knits
his
brow
and
shows
an
angry
eye
And
passeth
by
with
stiff
unbowed
knee
Disdaining
duty
that
to
us
belongs
Small
curs
are
not
regarded
when
they
grin
But
great
men
tremble
when
the
lion
roars
And
Humphrey
is
no
little
man
in
England
First
note
that
he
is
near
you
in
descent
And
should
you
fall
he
is
the
next
will
mount
Me
seemeth
then
it
is
no
policy
Respecting
what
a
rancorous
mind
he
bears
And
his
advantage
following
your
decease
That
he
should
come
about
your
royal
person
Or
be
admitted
to
your
Highness
Council
By
flattery
hath
he
won
the
commons
hearts
And
when
he
please
to
make
commotion
Tis
to
be
feard
they
all
will
follow
him
Now
tis
the
spring
and
weeds
are
shallowrooted
Suffer
them
now
and
theyll
oergrow
the
garden
And
choke
the
herbs
for
want
of
husbandry
The
reverent
care
I
bear
unto
my
lord
Made
me
collect
these
dangers
in
the
Duke
If
it
be
fond
can
it
a
womans
fear
Which
fear
if
better
reasons
can
supplant
I
will
subscribe
and
say
I
wrongd
the
Duke
My
Lord
of
Suffolk
Buckingham
and
York
Reprove
my
allegation
if
you
can
Or
else
conclude
my
words
effectual
Well
hath
your
Highness
seen
into
this
duke
And
had
I
first
been
put
to
speak
my
mind
I
think
I
should
have
told
your
Graces
tale
The
Duchess
by
his
subornation
Upon
my
life
began
her
devilish
practices
Or
if
he
were
not
privy
to
those
faults
Yet
by
reputing
of
his
high
descent
As
next
the
King
he
was
successive
heir
And
such
high
vaunts
of
his
nobility
Did
instigate
the
bedlam
brainsick
Duchess
By
wicked
means
to
frame
our
sovereigns
fall
Smooth
runs
the
water
where
the
brook
is
deep
And
in
his
simple
show
he
harbours
treason
The
fox
barks
not
when
he
would
steal
the
lamb
No
no
my
sovereign
Gloucester
is
a
man
Unsounded
yet
and
full
of
deep
deceit
Did
he
not
contrary
to
form
of
law
Devise
strange
deaths
for
small
offences
done
And
did
he
not
in
his
protectorship
Levy
great
sums
of
money
through
the
realm
For
soldiers
pay
in
France
and
never
sent
it
By
means
whereof
the
towns
each
day
revolted
Tut
these
are
petty
faults
to
faults
unknown
Which
time
will
bring
to
light
in
smooth
Duke
Humphrey
My
lords
at
once
the
care
you
have
of
us
To
mow
down
thorns
that
would
annoy
our
foot
Is
worthy
praise
but
shall
I
speak
my
conscience
Our
kinsman
Gloucester
is
as
innocent
From
meaning
treason
to
our
royal
person
As
is
the
sucking
lamb
or
harmless
dove
The
Duke
is
virtuous
mild
and
too
well
given
To
dream
on
evil
or
to
work
my
downfall
Ah
whats
more
dangerous
than
this
fond
affiance
Seems
he
a
dove
His
feathers
are
but
borrowd
For
hes
disposed
as
the
hateful
raven
Is
he
a
lamb
His
skin
is
surely
lent
him
For
hes
inclind
as
is
the
ravenous
wolf
Who
cannot
steal
a
shape
that
means
deceit
Take
heed
my
lord
the
welfare
of
us
all
Hangs
on
the
cutting
short
that
fraudful
man
Enter
All
health
unto
my
gracious
sovereign
Welcome
Lord
Somerset
What
news
from
France
That
all
your
interest
in
those
territories
Is
utterly
bereft
you
all
is
lost
Cold
news
Lord
Somerset
but
Gods
will
be
done
Aside
Cold
news
for
me
for
I
had
hope
of
France
As
firmly
as
I
hope
for
fertile
England
Thus
are
my
blossoms
blasted
in
the
bud
And
caterpillars
eat
my
leaves
away
But
I
will
remedy
this
gear
ere
long
Or
sell
my
title
for
a
glorious
grave
Enter
All
happiness
unto
my
lord
the
King
Pardon
my
liege
that
I
have
stayd
so
long
Nay
Gloucester
know
that
thou
art
come
too
soon
Unless
thou
wert
more
loyal
than
thou
art
I
do
arrest
thee
of
high
treason
here
Well
Suffolk
thou
shalt
not
see
me
blush
Nor
change
my
countenance
for
this
arrest
heart
unspotted
is
not
easily
daunted
The
purest
spring
is
not
so
free
from
mud
As
I
am
clear
from
treason
to
my
sovereign
Who
can
accuse
me
Wherein
am
I
guilty
Tis
thought
my
lord
that
you
took
bribes
of
France
And
being
Protector
stayd
the
soldiers
pay
By
means
whereof
his
Highness
hath
lost
France
Is
it
but
thought
so
What
are
they
that
think
it
I
never
robbd
the
soldiers
of
their
pay
Nor
ever
had
one
penny
bribe
from
France
So
help
me
God
as
I
have
watchd
the
night
Ay
night
by
night
in
studying
good
for
England
That
doit
that
eer
I
wrested
from
the
King
Or
any
groat
I
hoarded
to
my
use
Be
brought
against
me
at
my
trialday
No
many
a
pound
of
mine
own
proper
store
Because
I
would
not
tax
the
needy
commons
Have
I
dispursed
to
the
garrisons
And
never
askd
for
restitution
It
serves
you
well
my
lord
to
say
so
much
I
say
no
more
than
truth
so
help
me
God
In
your
protectorship
you
did
devise
Strange
tortures
for
offenders
never
heard
of
That
England
was
defamd
by
tyranny
Why
tis
well
known
that
whiles
I
was
Protector
Pity
was
all
the
fault
that
was
in
me
For
I
should
melt
at
an
offenders
tears
And
lowly
words
were
ransom
for
their
fault
Unless
it
were
a
bloody
murderer
Or
foul
felonious
thief
that
fleecd
poor
passengers
I
never
gave
them
condign
punishment
Murder
indeed
that
bloody
sin
I
torturd
Above
the
felon
or
what
trespass
else
My
lord
these
faults
are
easy
quickly
answerd
But
mightier
crimes
are
laid
unto
your
charge
Whereof
you
cannot
easily
purge
yourself
I
do
arrest
you
in
His
Highness
name
And
here
commit
you
to
my
Lord
Cardinal
To
keep
until
your
further
time
of
trial
My
Lord
of
Gloucester
tis
my
special
hope
That
you
will
clear
yourself
from
all
suspense
My
conscience
tells
me
you
are
innocent
Ah
gracious
lord
these
days
are
dangerous
Virtue
is
chokd
with
foul
ambition
And
charity
chasd
hence
by
rancours
hand
Foul
subornation
is
predominant
And
equity
exild
your
Highness
land
I
know
their
complot
is
to
have
my
life
And
if
my
death
might
make
this
island
happy
And
prove
the
period
of
their
tyranny
I
would
expend
it
with
all
willingness
But
mine
is
made
the
prologue
to
their
play
For
thousands
more
that
yet
suspect
no
peril
Will
not
conclude
their
plotted
tragedy
Beauforts
red
sparkling
eyes
blab
his
hearts
malice
And
Suffolks
cloudy
brow
his
stormy
hate
Sharp
Buckingham
unburdens
with
his
tongue
The
envious
load
that
lies
upon
his
heart
And
dogged
York
that
reaches
at
the
moon
Whose
overweening
arm
I
have
pluckd
back
By
false
accuse
doth
level
at
my
life
And
you
my
sovereign
lady
with
the
rest
Causeless
have
laid
disgraces
on
my
head
And
with
your
best
endeavour
have
stirrd
up
My
liefest
liege
to
be
mine
enemy
Ay
all
of
you
have
laid
your
heads
together
Myself
had
notice
of
your
conventicles
And
all
to
make
away
my
guiltless
life
I
shall
not
want
false
witness
to
condemn
me
Nor
store
of
treasons
to
augment
my
guilt
The
ancient
proverb
will
be
well
effected
staff
is
quickly
found
to
beat
a
dog
My
liege
his
railing
is
intolerable
If
those
that
care
to
keep
your
royal
person
From
treasons
secret
knife
and
traitors
rage
Be
thus
upbraided
chid
and
rated
at
And
the
offender
granted
scope
of
speech
Twill
make
them
cool
in
zeal
unto
your
Grace
Hath
he
not
twit
our
sovereign
lady
here
With
ignominious
words
though
clerkly
couchd
As
if
she
had
suborned
some
to
swear
False
allegations
to
oerthrow
his
state
But
I
can
give
the
loser
leave
to
chide
Far
truer
spoke
than
meant
I
lose
indeed
Beshrew
the
winners
for
they
playd
me
false
And
well
such
losers
may
have
leave
to
speak
Hell
wrest
the
sense
and
hold
us
here
all
day
Lord
Cardinal
he
is
your
prisoner
Sirs
take
away
the
Duke
and
guard
him
sure
Ah
thus
King
Henry
throws
away
his
crutch
Before
his
legs
be
firm
to
bear
his
body
Thus
is
the
shepherd
beaten
from
thy
side
And
wolves
are
gnarling
who
shall
gnaw
thee
first
Ah
that
my
fear
were
false
ah
that
it
were
For
good
King
Henry
thy
decay
I
fear
My
lords
what
to
your
wisdoms
seemeth
best
Do
or
undo
as
if
ourself
were
here
What
will
your
Highness
leave
the
Parliament
Ay
Margaret
my
heart
is
drownd
with
grief
Whose
flood
begins
to
flow
within
mine
eyes
My
body
round
engirt
with
misery
For
whats
more
miserable
than
discontent
Ah
uncle
Humphrey
in
thy
face
I
see
The
map
of
honour
truth
and
loyalty
And
yet
good
Humphrey
is
the
hour
to
come
That
eer
I
provd
thee
false
or
feard
thy
faith
What
louring
star
now
envies
thy
estate
That
these
great
lords
and
Margaret
our
Queen
Do
seek
subversion
of
thy
harmless
life
Thou
never
didst
them
wrong
nor
no
man
wrong
And
as
the
butcher
takes
away
the
calf
And
binds
the
wretch
and
beats
it
when
it
strays
Bearing
it
to
the
bloody
slaughterhouse
Even
so
remorseless
have
they
borne
him
hence
And
as
the
dam
runs
lowing
up
and
down
Looking
the
way
her
harmless
young
one
went
And
can
do
nought
but
wail
her
darlings
loss
Even
so
myself
bewails
good
Gloucesters
case
With
sad
unhelpful
tears
and
with
dimmd
eyes
Look
after
him
and
cannot
do
him
good
So
mighty
are
his
vowed
enemies
His
fortunes
I
will
weep
and
twixt
each
groan
Say
Whos
a
traitor
Gloucester
he
is
none
Free
lords
cold
snow
melts
with
the
suns
hot
beams
Henry
my
lord
is
cold
in
great
affairs
Too
full
of
foolish
pity
and
Gloucesters
show
Beguiles
him
as
the
mournful
crocodile
With
sorrow
snares
relenting
passengers
Or
as
the
snake
rolld
in
a
flowring
bank
With
shining
checkerd
slough
doth
sting
a
child
That
for
the
beauty
thinks
it
excellent
Believe
me
lords
were
none
more
wise
than
I
And
yet
herein
I
judge
mine
own
wit
good
This
Gloucester
should
be
quickly
rid
the
world
To
rid
us
from
the
fear
we
have
of
him
That
he
should
die
is
worthy
policy
But
yet
we
want
a
colour
for
his
death
Tis
meet
he
be
condemnd
by
course
of
law
But
in
my
mind
that
were
no
policy
The
King
will
labour
still
to
save
his
life
The
commons
haply
rise
to
save
his
life
And
yet
we
have
but
trivial
argument
More
than
mistrust
that
shows
him
worthy
death
So
that
by
this
you
would
not
have
him
die
Ah
York
no
man
alive
so
fain
as
I
Tis
York
that
hath
more
reason
for
his
death
But
my
Lord
Cardinal
and
you
my
Lord
of
Suffolk
Say
as
you
think
and
speak
it
from
your
souls
Weret
not
all
one
an
empty
eagle
were
set
To
guard
the
chicken
from
a
hungry
kite
As
place
Duke
Humphrey
for
the
Kings
Protector
So
the
poor
chicken
should
be
sure
of
death
Madam
tis
true
and
weret
not
madness
then
To
make
the
fox
surveyor
of
the
fold
Who
being
accusd
a
crafty
murderer
His
guilt
should
be
but
idly
posted
over
Because
his
purpose
is
not
executed
No
let
him
die
in
that
he
is
a
fox
By
nature
provd
an
enemy
to
the
flock
Before
his
chaps
be
staind
with
crimson
blood
As
Humphrey
provd
by
reasons
to
my
liege
And
do
not
stand
on
quillets
how
to
slay
him
Be
it
by
gins
by
snares
by
subtlety
Sleeping
or
waking
tis
no
matter
how
So
he
be
dead
for
that
is
good
deceit
Which
mates
him
first
that
first
intends
deceit
Thricenoble
Suffolk
tis
resolutely
spoke
Not
resolute
except
so
much
were
done
For
things
are
often
spoke
and
seldom
meant
But
that
my
heart
accordeth
with
my
tongue
Seeing
the
deed
is
meritorious
And
to
preserve
my
sovereign
from
his
foe
Say
but
the
word
and
I
will
be
his
priest
But
I
would
have
him
dead
my
Lord
of
Suffolk
Ere
you
can
take
due
orders
for
a
priest
Say
you
consent
and
censure
well
the
deed
And
Ill
provide
his
executioner
I
tender
so
the
safety
of
my
liege
Here
is
my
hand
the
deed
is
worthy
doing
And
so
say
I
And
I
And
now
we
three
have
spoke
it
It
skills
not
greatly
who
impugns
our
doom
Enter
a
Great
lords
from
Ireland
am
I
come
amain
To
signify
that
rebels
there
are
up
And
put
the
Englishmen
unto
the
sword
Send
succours
lords
and
stop
the
rage
betime
Before
the
wound
do
grow
uncurable
For
being
green
there
is
great
hope
of
help
breach
that
craves
a
quick
expedient
stop
What
counsel
give
you
in
this
weighty
cause
That
Somerset
be
sent
as
Regent
thither
Tis
meet
that
lucky
ruler
be
employd
Witness
the
fortune
he
hath
had
in
France
If
York
with
all
his
farfet
policy
Had
been
the
Regent
there
instead
of
me
He
never
would
have
stayd
in
France
so
long
No
not
to
lose
it
all
as
thou
hast
done
I
rather
would
have
lost
my
life
betimes
Than
bring
a
burden
of
dishonour
home
By
staying
there
so
long
till
all
were
lost
Show
me
one
scar
characterd
on
thy
skin
Mens
flesh
preservd
so
whole
do
seldom
win
Nay
then
this
spark
will
prove
a
raging
fire
If
wind
and
fuel
be
brought
to
feed
it
with
No
more
good
York
sweet
Somerset
be
still
Thy
fortune
York
hadst
thou
been
Regent
there
Might
happily
have
provd
far
worse
than
his
What
worse
than
nought
Nay
then
a
shame
take
all
And
in
the
number
thee
that
wishest
shame
My
Lord
of
York
try
what
your
fortune
is
Th
uncivil
kerns
of
Ireland
are
in
arms
And
temper
clay
with
blood
of
Englishmen
To
Ireland
will
you
lead
a
band
of
men
Collected
choicely
from
each
county
some
And
try
your
hap
against
the
Irishmen
I
will
my
lord
so
please
his
Majesty
Why
our
authority
is
his
consent
And
what
we
do
establish
he
confirms
Then
noble
York
take
thou
this
task
in
hand
I
am
content
provide
me
soldiers
lords
Whiles
I
take
order
for
mine
own
affairs
charge
Lord
York
that
I
will
see
performd
But
now
return
we
to
the
false
Duke
Humphrey
No
more
of
him
for
I
will
deal
with
him
That
henceforth
he
shall
trouble
us
no
more
And
so
break
off
the
day
is
almost
spent
Lord
Suffolk
you
and
I
must
talk
of
that
event
My
Lord
of
Suffolk
within
fourteen
days
At
Bristol
I
expect
my
soldiers
For
there
Ill
ship
them
all
for
Ireland
Ill
see
it
truly
done
my
Lord
of
York
Now
York
or
never
steel
thy
fearful
thoughts
And
change
misdoubt
to
resolution
Be
that
thou
hopst
to
be
or
what
thou
art
Resign
to
death
it
is
not
worth
th
enjoying
Let
palefacd
fear
keep
with
the
meanborn
man
And
find
no
harbour
in
a
royal
heart
Faster
than
springtime
showrs
comes
thought
on
thought
And
not
a
thought
but
thinks
on
dignity
My
brain
more
busy
than
the
labouring
spider
Weaves
tedious
snares
to
trap
mine
enemies
Well
nobles
well
tis
politicly
done
To
send
me
packing
with
an
host
of
men
I
fear
me
you
but
warm
the
starved
snake
Who
cherishd
in
your
breasts
will
sting
your
hearts
Twas
men
I
lackd
and
you
will
give
them
me
I
take
it
kindly
Yet
be
well
assurd
You
put
sharp
weapons
in
a
madmans
hands
Whiles
I
in
Ireland
nourish
a
mighty
band
I
will
stir
up
in
England
some
black
storm
Shall
blow
ten
thousand
souls
to
heaven
or
hell
And
this
fell
tempest
shall
not
cease
to
rage
Until
the
golden
circuit
on
my
head
Like
to
the
glorious
suns
transparent
beams
Do
calm
the
fury
of
this
madbred
flaw
And
for
a
minister
of
my
intent
I
have
seducd
a
headstrong
Kentishman
John
Cade
of
Ashford
To
make
commotion
as
full
well
he
can
Under
the
tide
of
John
Mortimer
In
Ireland
have
I
seen
this
stubborn
Cade
Oppose
himself
against
a
troop
of
kerns
And
fought
so
long
tiff
that
his
thighs
with
darts
Were
almost
like
a
sharpquilld
porpentine
And
in
the
end
being
rescud
I
have
seen
Him
caper
upright
like
a
wild
Morisco
Shaking
the
bloody
darts
as
he
his
bells
Full
often
like
a
shaghaird
crafty
kern
Hath
he
conversed
with
the
enemy
And
undiscoverd
come
to
me
again
And
given
me
notice
of
their
villainies
This
devil
here
shall
be
my
substitute
For
that
John
Mortimer
which
now
is
dead
In
face
in
gait
in
speech
he
doth
resemble
By
this
I
shall
perceive
the
commons
mind
How
they
affect
the
house
and
claim
of
York
Say
he
be
taken
rackd
and
tortured
I
know
no
pain
they
can
inflict
upon
him
Will
make
him
say
I
movd
him
to
those
arms
Say
that
he
thrive
as
tis
great
like
he
will
Why
then
from
Ireland
come
I
with
my
strength
And
reap
the
harvest
which
that
rascal
sowd
For
Humphrey
being
dead
as
he
shall
be
And
Henry
put
apart
the
next
for
me
How
fares
my
lord
Speak
Beaufort
to
thy
sovereign
If
thou
best
Death
Ill
give
thee
Englands
treasure
Enough
to
purchase
such
another
island
So
thou
wilt
let
me
live
and
feel
no
pain
Ah
what
a
sign
it
is
of
evil
life
Where
deaths
approach
is
seen
so
terrible
Beaufort
it
is
thy
sovereign
speaks
to
thee
Bring
me
unto
my
trial
when
you
will
Died
he
not
in
his
bed
Where
should
he
die
Can
I
make
men
live
wheer
they
will
or
no
torture
me
no
more
I
will
confess
Alive
again
Then
show
me
where
he
is
Ill
give
a
thousand
pound
to
look
upon
him
He
hath
no
eyes
the
dust
hath
blinded
them
Comb
down
his
hair
look
look
it
stands
upright
Like
limetwigs
set
to
catch
my
winged
soul
Give
me
some
drink
and
bid
the
apothecary
Bring
the
strong
poison
that
I
bought
of
him
Thou
eternal
Mover
of
the
heavens
Look
with
a
gentle
eye
upon
this
wretch
beat
away
the
busy
meddling
fiend
That
lays
strong
siege
unto
this
wretchs
soul
And
from
his
bosom
purge
this
black
despair
See
how
the
pangs
of
death
do
make
him
grin
Disturb
him
not
let
him
pass
peaceably
Peace
to
his
soul
if
Gods
good
pleasure
be
Lord
Cardnal
if
thou
thinkst
on
heavens
bliss
Hold
up
thy
hand
make
signal
of
thy
hope
He
dies
and
makes
no
sign
God
forgive
him
So
bad
a
death
argues
a
monstrous
life
Forbear
to
judge
for
we
are
sinners
all
Close
up
his
eyes
and
draw
the
curtain
close
And
let
us
all
to
meditation
I
The
coast
of
Kent
Alarum
Fight
at
sea
Ordnance
goes
off
Enter
a
a
and
his
and
with
sailors
and
other
as
prisoners
The
gaudy
blabbing
and
remorseful
day
Is
crept
into
the
bosom
of
the
sea
And
now
loudhowling
wolves
arouse
the
jades
That
drag
the
tragic
melancholy
night
Who
with
their
drowsy
slow
and
flagging
wings
Clip
dead
mens
graves
and
from
their
misty
jaws
Breathe
foul
contagious
darkness
in
the
air
Therefore
bring
forth
the
soldiers
of
our
prize
For
whilst
our
pinnace
anchors
in
the
Downs
Here
shall
they
make
their
ransom
on
the
sand
Or
with
their
blood
stain
this
discoloured
shore
Master
this
prisoner
freely
give
I
thee
And
thou
that
art
his
mate
make
boot
of
this
The
other
Walter
Whitmore
is
thy
share
What
is
my
ransom
master
let
me
know
thousand
crowns
or
else
lay
down
your
head
And
so
much
shall
you
give
or
off
goes
yours
What
think
you
much
to
pay
two
thousand
crowns
And
bear
the
name
and
port
of
gentlemen
Cut
both
the
villains
throats
for
die
you
shall
The
lives
of
those
which
we
have
lost
in
fight
Be
counterpoisd
with
such
a
petty
sum
Ill
give
it
sir
and
therefore
spare
my
life
And
so
will
I
and
write
home
for
it
straight
I
lost
mine
eye
in
laying
the
prize
aboard
To
And
therefore
to
revenge
it
shalt
thou
die
And
so
should
these
if
I
might
have
my
will
Be
not
so
rash
take
ransom
let
him
live
Look
on
my
George
I
am
a
gentleman
Rate
me
at
what
thou
wilt
thou
shalt
be
paid
And
so
am
I
my
name
is
Walter
Whitmore
How
now
Why
startst
thou
What
doth
death
affright
Thy
name
affrights
me
in
whose
sound
is
death
cunning
man
did
calculate
my
birth
And
told
me
that
by
water
I
should
die
Yet
let
not
this
make
thee
be
bloodyminded
Thy
name
is
Gualtier
being
rightly
sounded
Gualtier
or
Walter
which
it
is
I
care
not
Never
yet
did
base
dishonour
blur
our
name
But
with
our
sword
we
wipd
away
the
blot
Therefore
when
merchantlike
I
sell
revenge
Broke
be
my
sword
my
arms
torn
and
defacd
And
I
proclaimd
a
coward
through
the
world
Stay
Whitmore
for
thy
prisoner
is
a
prince
The
Duke
of
Suffolk
William
de
la
Pole
The
Duke
of
Suffolk
muffled
up
in
rags
Ay
but
these
rags
are
no
part
of
the
Duke
Jove
sometime
went
disguisd
and
why
not
I
But
Jove
was
never
slain
as
thou
shalt
be
Obscure
and
lowly
swain
King
Henrys
blood
The
honourable
blood
of
Lancaster
Must
not
be
shed
by
such
a
jaded
groom
Hast
thou
not
kissd
thy
hand
and
held
my
stirrup
Bareheaded
plodded
by
my
footcloth
mule
And
thought
thee
happy
when
I
shook
my
head
How
often
hast
thou
waited
at
my
cup
Fed
from
my
trencher
kneeld
down
at
the
board
When
I
have
feasted
with
Queen
Margaret
Remember
it
and
let
it
make
thee
crestfalln
Ay
and
allay
thus
thy
abortive
pride
How
in
our
voidinglobby
hast
thou
stood
And
duly
waited
for
my
coming
forth
This
hand
of
mine
hath
writ
in
thy
behalf
And
therefore
shall
it
charm
thy
riotous
tongue
Speak
Captain
shall
I
stab
the
forlorn
swain
First
let
my
words
stab
him
as
he
hath
me
Base
slave
thy
words
are
blunt
and
so
art
thou
Convey
him
hence
and
on
our
longboats
side
Strike
off
his
head
Thou
darst
not
for
thy
own
Poole
Poole
Ay
kennel
puddle
sink
whose
filth
and
dirt
Troubles
the
silver
spring
where
England
drinks
Now
will
I
dam
up
this
thy
yawning
mouth
For
swallowing
the
treasure
of
the
realm
Thy
lips
that
kissd
the
Queen
shall
sweep
the
ground
And
thou
that
smildst
at
good
Duke
Humphreys
death
Against
the
senseless
winds
shalt
grin
in
vain
Who
in
contempt
shall
hiss
at
thee
again
And
wedded
be
thou
to
the
hags
of
hell
For
daring
to
affy
a
mighty
lord
Unto
the
daughter
of
a
worthless
king
Having
neither
subject
wealth
nor
diadem
By
devilish
policy
art
thou
grown
great
And
like
ambitious
Sylla
overgorgd
With
gobbets
of
thy
mothers
bleeding
heart
By
thee
Anjou
and
Maine
were
sold
to
France
The
false
revolting
Normans
thorough
thee
Disdain
to
call
us
lord
and
Picardy
Hath
slain
their
governors
surprisd
our
forts
And
sent
the
ragged
soldiers
wounded
home
The
princely
Warwick
and
the
Nevils
all
Whose
dreadful
swords
were
never
drawn
in
vain
As
hating
thee
are
rising
up
in
arms
And
now
the
house
of
York
thrust
from
the
crown
By
shameful
murder
of
a
guiltless
king
And
lofty
proud
encroaching
tyranny
Burns
with
revenging
fire
whose
hopeful
colours
Advance
our
halffacd
sun
striving
to
shine
Under
the
which
is
writ
Invitis
nubibus
The
commons
here
in
Kent
are
up
in
arms
And
to
conclude
reproach
and
beggary
Is
crept
into
the
palace
of
our
King
And
all
by
thee
Away
convey
him
hence
that
I
were
a
god
to
shoot
forth
thunder
Upon
these
paltry
servile
abject
drudges
Small
things
make
base
men
proud
this
villain
here
Being
captain
of
a
pinnace
threatens
more
Than
Bargulus
the
strong
Illyrian
pirate
Drones
suck
not
eagles
blood
but
rob
beehives
It
is
impossible
that
I
should
die
By
such
a
lowly
vassal
as
thyself
Thy
words
move
rage
and
not
remorse
in
me
I
go
of
message
from
the
Queen
to
France
I
charge
thee
waft
me
safely
cross
the
Channel
Walter
Come
Suffolk
I
must
waft
thee
to
thy
death
Gelidus
timor
occupat
artus
it
is
thee
I
fear
Thou
shalt
have
cause
to
fear
before
I
leave
thee
What
are
ye
daunted
now
Now
will
ye
stoop
My
gracious
lord
entreat
him
speak
him
fair
Suffolks
imperial
tongue
is
stem
and
rough
Usd
to
command
untaught
to
plead
for
favour
Far
be
it
we
should
honour
such
as
these
With
humble
suit
no
rather
let
my
head
Stoop
to
the
block
than
these
knees
bow
to
any
Save
to
the
God
of
heaven
and
to
my
king
And
sooner
dance
upon
a
bloody
pole
Than
stand
uncoverd
to
the
vulgar
groom
True
nobility
is
exempt
from
fear
More
can
I
bear
than
you
dare
execute
Hale
him
away
and
let
him
talk
no
more
Come
soldiers
show
what
cruelty
ye
can
That
this
my
death
may
never
be
forgot
Great
men
oft
die
by
vile
bezonians
Roman
sworder
and
banditto
slave
Murderd
sweet
Tully
Brutus
bastard

Stabbd
Julius
Caesar
savage

Pompey
the
Great
and
Suffolk
dies
by

And
as
for
these
whose
ransom
we
have
set
It
is
our
pleasure
one
of
them
depart
Therefore
come
you
with
us
and
let
him
go
Reenter
with
body
There
let
his
head
and
lifeless
body
lie
Until
the
Queen
his
mistress
bury
it
barbarous
and
bloody
spectacle
His
body
will
I
bear
unto
the
King
If
he
revenge
it
not
yet
will
his
friends
So
will
the
Queen
that
living
held
him
dear
Wheres
Dick
the
butcher
of
Ashford
Here
sir
They
fell
before
thee
like
sheep
and
oxen
and
thou
behavedst
thyself
as
if
thou
hadst
been
in
thine
own
slaughterhouse
therefore
thus
will
I
reward
thee
the
Lent
shall
be
as
long
again
as
it
is
and
thou
shalt
have
a
licence
to
kill
for
a
hundred
lacking
one
I
desire
no
more
And
to
speak
truth
thou
deservst
no
less
Putting
on
brigandine
This
monument
of
the
victory
will
I
bear
and
the
bodies
shall
be
dragged
at
my
horse
heels
till
I
do
come
to
London
where
we
will
have
the
mayors
sword
borne
before
us
If
we
mean
to
thrive
and
do
good
break
open
the
gaols
and
let
out
the
prisoners
Fear
not
that
I
warrant
thee
Come
lets
march
towards
London
How
now
Is
Jack
Cade
slain
No
my
lord
nor
likely
to
be
slain
for
they
have
won
the
bridge
killing
all
those
that
withstand
them
The
Lord
Mayor
craves
aid
of
your
honour
from
the
Tower
to
defend
the
city
from
the
rebels
Such
aid
as
I
can
spare
you
shall
command
But
I
am
troubled
here
with
them
myself
The
rebels
have
assayd
to
win
the
Tower
But
get
you
to
Smithfield
and
gather
head
And
thither
I
will
send
you
Matthew
Goffe
Fight
for
your
King
your
country
and
your
lives
And
so
farewell
for
I
must
hence
again
So
sirs
Now
go
some
and
pull
down
the
Savoy
others
to
th
Inns
of
Court
down
with
them
all
I
have
a
suit
unto
your
lordship
Be
it
a
lordship
thou
shalt
have
it
for
that
word
Only
that
the
laws
of
England
may
come
out
of
your
mouth
Aside
Mass
twill
be
sore
law
then
for
he
was
thrust
in
the
mouth
with
a
spear
and
tis
not
whole
yet
Aside
Nay
John
it
will
be
stinking
law
for
his
breath
stinks
with
eating
toasted
cheese
I
have
thought
upon
it
it
shall
be
so
Away
burn
all
the
records
of
the
realm
My
mouth
shall
be
the
Parliament
of
England
Aside
Then
we
are
like
to
have
biting
statutes
unless
his
teeth
be
pulld
out
And
henceforward
all
things
shall
be
in
common
Enter
a
My
lord
a
prize
a
prize
Heres
the
Lord
Say
which
sold
the
towns
in
France
he
that
made
us
pay
one
and
twenty
fifteens
and
one
shining
to
the
pound
the
last
subsidy
Enter
with
the
Well
he
shall
be
beheaded
for
it
ten
times
Ah
thou
say
thou
serge
nay
thou
buckram
lord
Now
art
thou
within
point
blank
of
our
jurisdiction
regal
What
canst
thou
answer
to
my
Majesty
for
giving
up
of
Normandy
unto
Mounsieur
Basimecu
the
Dauphin
of
France
Be
it
known
unto
thee
by
these
presence
even
the
presence
of
Lord
Mortimer
that
I
am
the
besom
that
must
sweep
the
court
clean
of
such
filth
as
thou
art
Thou
hast
most
traitorously
corrupted
the
youth
of
the
realm
in
erecting
a
grammar
school
and
whereas
before
our
forefathers
had
no
other
books
but
the
score
and
the
tally
thou
hast
caused
printing
to
be
usd
and
contrary
to
the
King
his
crown
and
dignity
thou
hast
built
a
papermill
It
will
be
proved
to
thy
face
that
thou
hast
men
about
thee
that
usually
talk
of
a
noun
and
a
verb
and
such
abominable
words
as
no
Christian
ear
can
endure
to
hear
Thou
hast
appointed
justices
of
peace
to
call
poor
men
before
them
about
matters
they
were
not
able
to
answer
Moreover
thou
hast
put
them
in
prison
and
because
they
could
not
read
thou
hast
hangd
them
when
indeed
only
for
that
cause
they
have
been
most
worthy
to
live
Thou
dost
ride
in
a
footcloth
dost
thou
not
What
of
that
Marry
thou
oughtst
not
to
let
thy
horse
wear
a
cloak
when
honester
men
than
thou
go
in
their
hose
and
doublets
And
work
in
their
shirt
too
as
myself
for
example
that
am
a
butcher
You
men
of
Kent
What
say
you
of
Kent
Nothing
but
this

Away

away
with

He
speaks

Hear

but
speak
and
bear
me
where
you
will
Kent
in
the
Commentaries
Caesar

Is

Sweet
is
the
country
because
full
of

The
people
liberal

Which
makes
me
hope
you
are
not
void
of
pity
I
sold
not
Maine
I
lost
not
Normandy
Yet
to
recover
them
would
lose
my
life
Justice
with
favour
have
I
always
done
Prayrs
and
tears
have
movd
me
gifts
could
never
When
have
I
aught
exacted
at
your
hands
But
to
maintain
the
King
the
realm
and
you
Large
gifts
have
I
bestowd
on
learned
clerks
Because
my
book
preferrd
me
to
the
King
And
seeing
ignorance
is
the
curse
of
God
Knowledge
the
wing
wherewith
we
fly
to
heaven
Unless
you
be
possessd
with
devilish
spirits
You
cannot
but
forbear
to
murder
me
This
tongue
hath
parleyd
unto
foreign
kings
For
your
behoof
Tut
when
struckst
thou
one
blow
in
the
field
Great
men
have
reaching
hands
Oft
have
I
struck
Those
that
I
never
saw
and
struck
them
dead
monstrous
coward
What
to
come
behind
folks
These
cheeks
are
pale
for
watching
for
your
good
Give
him
a
box
o
th
ear
and
that
will
make
em
red
again
Long
sitting
to
determine
poor
mens
causes
Hath
made
me
full
of
sickness
and
diseases
Ye
shall
have
a
hempen
caudle
then
and
the
help
of
hatchet
Why
dost
thou
quiver
man
The
palsy
and
not
fear
provokes
me
Nay
he
nods
at
us
as
who
should
say
Ill
be
even
with
you
Ill
see
if
his
head
will
stand
steadier
on
a
pole
or
no
Take
him
away
and
behead
him
Tell
me
wherein
have
I
offended
most
Have
I
affected
wealth
or
honour
Speak
Are
my
chests
filld
up
with
extorted
gold
Is
my
apparel
sumptuous
to
behold
Whom
have
I
injurd
that
ye
seek
my
death
These
hands
are
free
from
guiltless
bloodshedding
This
breast
from
harbouring
foul
deceitful
thoughts
let
me
live
Aside
I
feel
remorse
in
myself
with
his
words
but
Ill
bridle
it
He
shall
die
an
it
be
but
for
pleading
so
well
for
his
life
Away
with
him
He
has
a
familiar
under
his
tongue
he
speaks
not
o
Gods
name
Go
take
him
away
I
say
and
strike
off
his
head
presently
and
then
break
into
his
soninlaws
house
Sir
James
Cromer
and
strike
off
his
head
and
bring
them
both
upon
two
poles
hither
It
shall
be
done
Ah
countrymen
if
when
you
make
your
prayrs
God
should
be
so
obdurate
as
yourselves
How
would
it
fare
with
your
departed
souls
And
therefore
yet
relent
and
save
my
life
Away
with
him
and
do
as
I
command
ye
The
proudest
peer
in
the
realm
shall
not
wear
a
head
on
his
shoulders
unless
he
pay
me
tribute
there
shall
not
a
maid
be
married
but
she
shall
pay
to
me
her
maidenhead
ere
they
have
it
Men
shall
hold
of
me
in
capite
and
we
charge
and
command
that
their
wives
be
as
free
as
heart
can
wish
or
tongue
can
tell
My
lord
when
shall
we
go
to
Cheapside
and
take
up
commodities
upon
our
bills
Marry
presently
brave
Reenter
one
with
the
heads
But
is
not
this
braver
Let
them
kiss
one
another
for
they
lovd
well
when
they
were
alive
Now
part
them
again
lest
they
consult
about
the
giving
up
of
some
more
towns
in
France
Soldiers
defer
the
spoil
of
the
city
until
night
for
with
these
borne
before
us
instead
of
maces
will
we
ride
through
the
streets
and
at
every
corner
have
them
kiss
Away
Was
ever
king
that
joyd
an
earthly
throne
And
could
command
no
more
content
than
I
No
sooner
was
I
crept
out
of
my
cradle
But
I
was
made
a
king
at
nine
months
old
Was
never
subject
longd
to
be
a
King
As
I
do
long
and
wish
to
be
a
subject
Enter
and
old
Health
and
glad
tidings
to
your
Majesty
Why
Buckingham
is
the
traitor
Cade
surprisd
Or
is
he
but
retird
to
make
him
strong
Enter
below
multitudes
with
halters
about
their
necks
He
is
fled
my
lord
and
all
his
powers
do
yield
And
humbly
thus
with
halters
on
their
necks
Expect
your
Highness
doom
of
life
or
death
Then
heaven
set
ope
thy
everlasting
gates
To
entertain
my
vows
of
thanks
and
praise
Soldiers
this
day
have
you
redeemd
your
lives
And
showd
how
well
you
love
your
Prince
and
country
Continue
still
in
this
so
good
a
mind
And
Henry
though
he
be
infortunate
Assure
yourselves
will
never
be
unkind
And
so
with
thanks
and
pardon
to
you
all
I
do
dismiss
you
to
your
several
countries
God
save
the
King
God
save
the
King
Enter
a
Please
it
your
Grace
to
be
advertised
The
Duke
of
York
is
newly
come
from
Ireland
And
with
a
puissant
and
a
mighty
power
Of
gallowglasses
and
stout
kerns
Is
marching
hitherward
in
proud
array
And
still
proclaimeth
as
he
comes
along
His
arms
are
only
to
remove
from
thee
The
Duke
of
Somerset
whom
he
terms
a
traitor
Thus
stands
my
state
twixt
Cade
and
York
distressd
Like
to
a
ship
that
having
scapd
a
tempest
Is
straightway
calmd
and
boarded
with
a
pirate
But
now
is
Cade
driven
back
his
men
dispersd
And
now
is
York
in
arms
to
second
him
I
pray
thee
Buckingham
go
and
meet
him
And
ask
him
whats
the
reason
of
these
arms
Tell
him
Ill
send
Duke
Edmund
to
the
Tower
And
Somerset
we
will
commit
thee
thither
Until
his
army
be
dismissd
from
him
My
lord
Ill
yield
myself
to
prison
willingly
Or
unto
death
to
do
my
country
good
In
any
case
be
not
too
rough
in
terms
For
he
is
fierce
and
cannot
brook
hard
language
I
will
my
lord
and
doubt
not
so
to
deal
As
all
things
shall
redound
unto
your
good
Come
wife
lets
in
and
learn
to
govern
better
For
yet
may
England
curse
my
wretched
reign
Flourish
Clifford
of
Cumberland
tis
Warwick
calls
And
if
thou
dost
not
hide
thee
from
the
bear
Now
when
the
angry
trumpet
sounds
alarum
And
dead
mens
cries
do
fill
the
empty
air
Clifford
I
say
come
forth
and
fight
with
me
Proud
northern
lord
Clifford
of
Cumberland
is
hoarse
with
calling
thee
to
arms
Enter
How
now
my
noble
lord
what
all
afoot
The
deadlyhanded
Clifford
slew
my
steed
But
match
to
match
I
have
encountred
him
And
made
a
prey
for
carrion
kites
and
crows
Even
of
the
bonny
beast
he
lovd
so
well
Enter
Of
one
or
both
of
us
the
time
is
come
Hold
Warwick
seek
thee
out
some
other
chase
For
I
myself
must
hunt
this
deer
to
death
Then
nobly
York
tis
for
a
crown
thou
fightst
As
I
intend
Clifford
to
thrive
today
It
grieves
my
soul
to
leave
thee
unassaild
What
seest
thou
in
me
York
Why
dost
thou
pause
With
thy
brave
bearing
should
I
be
in
love
But
that
thou
art
so
fast
mine
enemy
Nor
should
thy
prowess
want
praise
and
esteem
But
that
tis
shown
ignobly
and
in
treason
So
let
it
help
me
now
against
thy
sword
As
I
in
justice
and
true
right
express
it
My
soul
and
body
on
the
action
both
dreadful
lay
Address
thee
instantly
They
fight
and
falls
La
fin
couronne
les
oeuvres
Dies
Thus
war
hath
given
thee
peace
for
thou
art
still
Peace
with
his
soul
heaven
if
it
be
thy
will
Enter
Shame
and
confusion
All
is
on
the
rout
Fear
frames
disorder
and
disorder
wounds
Where
it
should
guard
war
thou
son
of
hell
Whom
angry
heavens
do
make
their
minister
Throw
in
the
frozen
bosoms
of
our
part
Hot
coals
of
vengeance
Let
no
soldier
fly
He
that
is
truly
dedicate
to
war
Hath
no
selflove
nor
he
that
loves
himself
Hath
not
essentially
but
by
circumstance
The
name
of
valour
Sees
his
fathers
body
let
the
vile
world
end
And
the
premised
flames
of
the
last
day
Knit
earth
and
heaven
together
Now
let
the
general
trumpet
blow
his
blast
Particularities
and
petty
sounds
To
cease
Wast
thou
ordaind
dear
father
To
lose
thy
youth
in
peace
and
to
achieve
The
silver
livery
of
advised
age
And
in
thy
reverence
and
thy
chairdays
thus
To
die
in
ruffian
battle
Even
at
this
sight
My
heart
is
turnd
to
stone
and
while
tis
mine
It
shall
be
stony
York
not
our
old
men
spares
No
more
will
I
their
babes
Tears
virginal
Shall
be
to
me
even
as
the
dew
to
fire
And
beauty
that
the
tyrant
oft
reclaims
Shall
to
my
flaming
wrath
be
oil
and
flax
Henceforth
I
will
not
have
to
do
with
pity
Meet
I
an
infant
of
the
house
of
York
Into
as
many
gobbets
will
I
cut
it
As
wild
Medea
young
Absyrtus
did
In
cruelty
will
I
seek
out
my
fame
Come
thou
new
ruin
of
old
Cliffords
house
As
did
Aeneas
old
Anchises
bear
So
bear
I
thee
upon
my
manly
shoulders
But
then
Aeneas
bare
a
living
load
Nothing
so
heavy
as
these
woes
of
mine
Enter
and
to
fight
is
killed
So
lie
thou
there
For
underneath
an
alehouse
paltry
sign
The
Castle
in
Saint
Albans
Somerset
Hath
made
the
wizard
famous
in
his
death
Sword
hold
thy
temper
heart
be
wrathful
still
Priests
pray
for
enemies
but
princes
kill
Fight
Excursions
Enter
and
others
Away
my
lord
You
are
slow
for
shame
away
Can
we
outrun
the
heavens
Good
Margaret
stay
What
are
you
made
of
Youll
nor
fight
nor
fly
Now
is
it
manhood
wisdom
and
defence
To
give
the
enemy
way
and
to
secure
us
By
what
we
can
which
can
no
more
but
fly
Alarum
afar
off
If
you
be
taen
we
then
should
see
the
bottom
Of
all
our
fortunes
but
if
we
haply
scape
As
well
we
may
if
not
through
your
neglect
We
shall
to
London
get
where
you
are
lovd
And
where
this
breach
now
in
our
fortunes
made
May
readily
be
stoppd
Reenter
But
that
my
hearts
on
future
mischief
set
I
would
speak
blasphemy
ere
bid
you
fly
But
fly
you
must
uncurable
discomfit
Reigns
in
the
hearts
of
all
our
present
parts
Away
for
your
relief
and
we
will
live
To
see
their
day
and
them
our
fortune
give
Away
my
lord
away
I
I
London
The
Parliament
House
Alarum
Enter
and
soldiers
with
white
roses
in
their
hats
I
wonder
how
the
King
escapd
our
hands
While
we
pursud
the
horsemen
of
the
north
He
slily
stole
away
and
left
his
men
Whereat
the
great
Lord
of
Northumberland
Whose
warlike
ears
could
never
brook
retreat
Cheerd
up
the
drooping
army
and
himself
Lord
Clifford
and
Lord
Stafford
all
abreast
Chargd
our
main
battles
front
and
breaking
in
Were
by
the
swords
of
common
soldiers
slain
Lord
Staffords
father
Duke
of
Buckingham
Is
either
slain
or
wounded
dangerous
I
cleft
his
beaver
with
a
downright
blow
That
this
is
true
father
behold
his
blood
And
brother
heres
the
Earl
of
Wiltshires
blood
Whom
I
encountred
as
the
battles
joind
Speak
thou
for
me
and
tell
them
what
I
did
Throwing
down
head
Richard
hath
best
deservd
of
all
my
sons
But
is
your
Grace
dead
my
Lord
of
Somerset
Such
hope
have
all
the
line
of
John
of
Gaunt
Thus
do
I
hope
to
shake
King
Henrys
head
And
so
do
I
Victorious
Prince
of
York
Before
I
see
thee
seated
in
that
throne
Which
now
the
house
of
Lancaster
usurps
I
vow
by
heaven
these
eyes
shall
never
close
This
is
the
palace
of
the
fearful
King
And
this
the
regal
seat
Possess
it
York
For
this
is
thine
and
not
King
Henrys
heirs
Assist
me
then
sweet
Warwick
and
I
will
For
hither
we
have
broken
in
by
force
Well
all
assist
you
he
that
flies
shall
die
Thanks
gentle
Norfolk
Stay
by
me
my
lords
And
soldiers
stay
and
lodge
by
me
this
night
They
go
up
And
when
the
King
comes
offer
him
no
violence
Unless
he
seek
to
thrust
you
out
perforce
The
Queen
this
day
here
holds
her
parliament
But
little
thinks
we
shall
be
of
her
council
By
words
or
blows
here
let
us
win
our
right
Armd
as
we
are
lets
stay
within
this
house
The
bloody
parliament
shall
this
be
calld
Unless
Plantagenet
Duke
of
York
be
King
And
bashful
Henry
deposd
whose
cowardice
Hath
made
us
bywords
to
our
enemies
Then
leave
me
not
my
lords
be
resolute
I
mean
to
take
possession
of
my
right
Neither
the
King
nor
he
that
loves
him
best
The
proudest
he
that
holds
up
Lancaster
Dares
stir
a
wing
if
Warwick
shake
his
bells
Ill
plant
Plantagenet
root
him
up
who
dares
Resolve
thee
Richard
claim
the
English
crown
occupies
the
throne
Flourish
Enter
and
others
with
red
roses
in
their
hats
My
lords
look
where
the
sturdy
rebel
sits
Even
in
the
chair
of
state
Belike
he
means
Backd
by
the
power
of
Warwick
that
false
peer
To
aspire
unto
the
crown
and
reign
as
king
Earl
of
Northumberland
he
slew
thy
father
And
thine
Lord
Clifford
and
you
both
have
vowd
revenge
On
him
his
sons
his
favourites
and
his
friends
If
I
be
not
heavens
be
revengd
on
me
The
hope
thereof
makes
Clifford
mourn
in
steel
What
shall
we
suffer
this
Lets
pluck
him
down
My
heart
for
anger
burns
I
cannot
brook
it
Be
patient
gentle
Earl
of
Westmoreland
Patience
is
for
poltroons
such
as
he
He
durst
not
sit
there
had
your
father
livd
My
gracious
lord
here
in
the
parliament
Let
us
assail
the
family
of
York
Well
hast
thou
spoken
cousin
be
it
so
Ah
know
you
not
the
city
favours
them
And
they
have
troops
of
soldiers
at
their
beck
But
when
the
Duke
is
slain
theyll
quickly
fly
Far
be
the
thought
of
this
from
Henrys
heart
To
make
a
shambles
of
the
parliament
house
Cousin
of
Exeter
frowns
words
and
threats
Shall
be
the
war
that
Henry
means
to
use
Thou
factious
Duke
of
York
descend
my
throne
And
kneel
for
grace
and
mercy
at
my
feet
I
am
thy
sovereign
I
am
thine
For
shame
come
down
he
made
thee
Duke
of
York
Twas
my
inheritance
as
the
earldom
was
Thy
father
was
a
traitor
to
the
crown
Exeter
thou
art
a
traitor
to
the
crown
In
following
this
usurping
Henry
Whom
should
he
follow
but
his
natural
king
True
Clifford
and
thats
Richard
Duke
of
York
And
shall
I
stand
and
thou
sit
in
my
throne
It
must
and
shall
be
so
content
thyself
Be
Duke
of
Lancaster
let
him
be
King
He
is
both
King
and
Duke
of
Lancaster
And
that
the
Lord
of
Westmoreland
shall
maintain
And
Warwick
shall
disprove
it
You
forget
That
we
are
those
which
chasd
you
from
the
field
And
slew
your
fathers
and
with
colours
spread
Marchd
through
the
city
to
the
palace
gates
Yes
Warwick
I
remember
it
to
my
grief
And
by
his
soul
thou
and
thy
house
shall
rue
it
Plantagenet
of
thee
and
these
thy
sons
Thy
kinsmen
and
thy
friends
Ill
have
more
lives
Than
drops
of
blood
were
in
my
fathers
veins
Urge
it
no
more
lest
that
instead
of
words
I
send
thee
Warwick
such
a
messenger
As
shall
revenge
his
death
before
I
stir
Poor
Clifford
how
I
scorn
his
worthless
threats
Will
you
we
show
our
title
to
the
crown
If
not
our
swords
shall
plead
it
in
the
field
What
title
hast
thou
traitor
to
the
crown
Thy
father
was
as
thou
art
Duke
of
York
Thy
grandfather
Roger
Mortimer
Earl
of
March
I
am
the
son
of
Henry
the
Fifth
Who
made
the
Dauphin
and
the
French
to
stoop
And
seizd
upon
their
towns
and
provinces
Talk
not
of
France
sith
thou
hast
lost
it
all
The
Lord
Protector
lost
it
and
not
I
When
I
was
crownd
I
was
but
nine
months
old
You
are
old
enough
now
and
yet
methinks
you
lose
Father
tear
the
crown
from
the
usurpers
head
Sweet
father
do
so
set
it
on
your
head
Good
brother
as
thou
lovst
and
honourest
arms
Lets
fight
it
out
and
not
stand
cavilling
thus
Sound
drums
and
trumpets
and
the
King
will
fly
Sons
peace
Peace
thou
and
give
King
Henry
leave
to
speak
Plantagenet
shall
speak
first
Hear
him
lords
And
be
you
silent
and
attentive
too
For
he
that
interrupts
him
shall
not
live
Thinkst
thou
that
I
will
leave
my
kingly
throne
Wherein
my
grandsire
and
my
father
sat
No
first
shall
war
unpeople
this
my
realm
Ay
and
their
colours
often
borne
in
France
And
now
in
England
to
our
hearts
great
sorrow
Shall
be
my
windingsheet
Why
faint
you
lords
My
titles
good
and
better
far
than
his
Prove
it
Henry
and
thou
shalt
be
King
Henry
the
Fourth
by
conquest
got
the
crown
Twas
by
rebellion
against
his
king
Aside
I
know
not
what
to
say
my
titles
weak
Tell
me
may
not
a
king
adopt
an
heir
What
then
An
if
he
may
then
am
I
lawful
King
For
Richard
in
the
view
of
many
lords
Resignd
the
crown
to
Henry
the
Fourth
Whose
heir
my
father
was
and
I
am
his
He
rose
against
him
being
his
sovereign
And
made
him
to
resign
his
crown
perforce
Suppose
my
lords
he
did
it
unconstraind
Think
you
twere
prejudicial
to
his
crown
No
for
he
could
not
so
resign
his
crown
But
that
the
next
heir
should
succeed
and
reign
Art
thou
against
us
Duke
of
Exeter
His
is
the
right
and
therefore
pardon
me
Why
whisper
you
my
lords
and
answer
not
My
conscience
tells
me
he
is
lawful
King
Aside
All
will
revolt
from
me
and
turn
to
him
Plantagenet
for
all
the
claim
thou
layst
Think
not
that
Henry
shall
be
so
deposd
Deposd
he
shall
be
in
despite
of
all
Thou
art
deceivd
Tis
not
thy
southern
power
Of
Essex
Norfolk
Suffolk
nor
of
Kent
Which
makes
thee
thus
presumptuous
and
proud
Can
set
the
Duke
up
in
despite
of
me
King
Henry
be
thy
title
right
or
wrong
Lord
Clifford
vows
to
fight
in
thy
defence
May
that
ground
gape
and
swallow
me
alive
Where
I
shall
kneel
to
him
that
slew
my
father
Clifford
how
thy
words
revive
my
heart
Henry
of
Lancaster
resign
thy
crown
What
mutter
you
or
what
conspire
you
lords
Do
right
unto
this
princely
Duke
of
York
Or
I
will
fill
the
house
with
armed
men
And
over
the
chair
of
state
where
now
he
sits
Write
up
his
title
with
usurping
blood
He
stamps
with
his
foot
and
the
soldiers
show
themselves
My
Lord
of
Warwick
hear
but
one
word
Let
me
for
this
my
lifetime
reign
as
king
Confirm
the
crown
to
me
and
to
mine
heirs
And
thou
shalt
reign
in
quiet
while
thou
livst
I
am
content
Richard
Plantagenet
Enjoy
the
kingdom
after
my
decease
What
wrong
is
this
unto
the
Prince
your
son
What
good
is
this
to
England
and
himself
Base
fearful
and
despairing
Henry
How
hast
thou
injurd
both
thyself
and
or
us
I
cannot
stay
to
hear
these
articles
Nor
I
Come
cousin
let
us
tell
the
Queen
these
news
Farewell
fainthearted
and
degenerate
king
In
whose
cold
blood
no
spark
of
honour
bides
Be
thou
a
prey
unto
the
house
of
York
And
die
in
bands
for
this
unmanly
deed
In
dreadful
war
mayst
thou
be
overcome
Or
live
in
peace
abandond
and
despisd
and
Turn
this
way
Henry
and
regard
them
not
They
seek
revenge
and
therefore
will
not
yield
Ah
Exeter
Why
should
you
sigh
my
lord
Not
for
myself
Lord
Warwick
but
my
son
Whom
I
unnaturally
shall
disinherit
But
be
it
as
it
may
To
I
here
entail
The
crown
to
thee
and
to
thine
heirs
for
ever
Conditionally
that
here
thou
take
an
oath
To
cease
this
civil
war
and
whilst
I
live
To
honour
me
as
thy
king
and
sovereign
And
neither
by
treason
nor
hostility
To
seek
to
put
me
down
and
reign
thyself
This
oath
I
willingly
take
and
will
perform
Coming
from
the
throne
Long
live
King
Henry
Plantagenet
embrace
him
And
long
live
thou
and
these
thy
forward
sons
Now
York
and
Lancaster
are
reconcild
Accursd
be
he
that
seeks
to
make
them
foes
Sennet
Here
they
come
down
Farewell
my
gracious
lord
Ill
to
my
castle
And
Ill
keep
London
with
my
soldiers
And
I
to
Norfolk
with
my
followers
And
I
unto
the
sea
from
whence
I
came
And
I
with
grief
and
sorrow
to
the
court
Enter
and
the
Here
comes
the
Queen
whose
looks
bewray
her
anger
Ill
steal
away
Exeter
so
will
I
Nay
go
not
from
me
I
will
follow
thee
Be
patient
gentle
queen
and
I
will
stay
Who
can
be
patient
in
such
extremes
Ah
wretched
man
Would
I
had
died
a
maid
And
never
seen
thee
never
borne
thee
son
Seeing
thou
hast
provd
so
unnatural
a
father
Hath
he
deservd
to
lose
his
birthright
thus
Hadst
thou
but
lovd
him
half
so
well
as
I
Or
felt
that
pain
which
I
did
for
him
once
Or
nourishd
him
as
I
did
with
my
blood
Thou
wouldst
have
left
thy
dearest
heartblood
there
Rather
than
have
made
that
savage
duke
thine
heir
And
disinherited
thine
only
son
Father
you
cannot
disinherit
me
If
you
be
King
why
should
not
I
succeed
Pardon
me
Margaret
pardon
me
sweet
son
The
Earl
of
Warwick
and
the
Duke
enforcd
me
Enforcd
thee
Art
thou
King
and
wilt
be
forcd
I
shame
to
hear
thee
speak
Ah
timorous
wretch
Thou
hast
undone
thyself
thy
son
and
me
And
givn
unto
the
house
of
York
such
head
As
thou
shalt
reign
but
by
their
sufferance
To
entail
him
and
his
heirs
unto
the
crown
What
is
it
but
to
make
thy
sepulchre
And
creep
into
it
far
before
thy
time
Warwick
is
Chancellor
and
the
lord
of
Calais
Stern
Falconbridge
commands
the
narrow
seas
The
Duke
is
made
Protector
of
the
realm
And
yet
shalt
thou
be
safe
Such
safety
finds
The
trembling
lamb
environed
with
wolves
Had
I
been
there
which
am
a
silly
woman
The
soldiers
should
have
tossd
me
on
their
pikes
Before
I
would
have
granted
to
that
act
But
thou
preferst
thy
life
before
thine
honour
And
seeing
thou
dost
I
here
divorce
myself
Both
from
thy
table
Henry
and
thy
bed
Until
that
act
of
parliament
be
repeald
Whereby
my
son
is
disinherited
The
northern
lords
that
have
forsworn
thy
colours
Will
follow
mine
if
once
they
see
them
spread
And
spread
they
shall
be
to
thy
foul
disgrace
And
utter
ruin
of
the
house
of
York
Thus
do
I
leave
thee
Come
son
lets
away
Our
army
is
ready
come
well
after
them
Stay
gentle
Margaret
and
hear
me
speak
Thou
hast
spoke
too
much
already
get
thee
gone
Gentle
son
Edward
thou
wilt
stay
with
me
Ay
to
be
murderd
by
his
enemies
When
I
return
with
victory
from
the
field
Ill
see
your
Grace
till
then
Ill
follow
her
Come
son
away
we
may
not
linger
thus
Poor
queen
How
love
to
me
and
to
her
son
Hath
made
her
break
out
into
terms
of
rage
Revengd
may
she
be
on
that
hateful
Duke
Whose
haughty
spirit
winged
with
desire
Will
cost
my
crown
and
like
an
empty
eagle
Tire
on
the
flesh
of
me
and
of
my
son
The
loss
of
those
three
lords
torments
my
heart
Ill
write
unto
them
and
entreat
them
fair
Come
cousin
you
shall
be
the
messenger
And
I
I
hope
shall
reconcile
them
all
Ah
whither
shall
I
fly
to
scape
their
hands
Ah
tutor
look
where
bloody
Clifford
comes
Enter
and
soldiers
Chaplain
away
Thy
priesthood
saves
thy
life
As
for
the
brat
of
this
accursed
duke
Whose
father
slew
my
father
he
shall
die
And
I
my
lord
will
bear
him
company
Soldiers
away
with
him
Ah
Clifford
murder
not
this
innocent
child
Lest
thou
be
hated
both
of
God
and
man
How
now
is
he
dead
already
Or
is
it
fear
That
makes
him
close
his
eyes
Ill
open
them
So
looks
the
pentup
lion
oer
the
wretch
That
trembles
under
his
devouring
paws
And
so
he
walks
insulting
oer
his
prey
And
so
he
comes
to
rend
his
limbs
asunder
Ah
gentle
Clifford
kill
me
with
thy
sword
And
not
with
such
a
cruel
threatning
look
Sweet
Clifford
hear
me
speak
before
I
die
I
am
too
mean
a
subject
for
thy
wrath
Be
thou
revengd
on
men
and
let
me
live
In
vain
thou
speakst
poor
boy
my
fathers
blood
Hath
stoppd
the
passage
where
thy
words
should
enter
Then
let
my
fathers
blood
open
it
again
He
is
a
man
and
Clifford
cope
with
him
Had
I
thy
brethren
here
their
lives
and
thine
Were
not
revenge
sufficient
for
me
No
if
I
diggd
up
thy
forefathers
graves
And
hung
their
rotten
coffins
up
in
chains
It
could
not
slake
mine
ire
nor
ease
my
heart
The
sight
of
any
of
the
house
of
York
Is
as
a
fury
to
torment
my
soul
And
till
I
root
out
their
accursed
line
And
leave
not
one
alive
I
live
in
hell
Therefore
let
me
pray
before
I
take
my
death
To
thee
I
pray
sweet
Clifford
pity
me
Such
pity
as
my
rapiers
point
affords
I
never
did
thee
harm
why
wilt
thou
slay
me
Thy
father
hath
But
twas
ere
I
was
born
Thou
hast
one
son
for
his
sake
pity
me
Lest
in
revenge
thereof
sith
God
is
just
He
be
as
miserably
slain
as
I
Ah
let
me
live
in
prison
all
my
days
And
when
I
give
occasion
of
offence
Then
let
me
die
for
now
thou
hast
no
cause
No
cause
Thy
father
slew
my
father
therefore
die
Stabs
him
Di
faciant
laudis
summa
sit
ista
tuae
Dies
Plantagenet
I
come
Plantagenet
And
this
thy
sons
blood
cleaving
to
my
blade
Shall
rust
upon
my
weapon
till
thy
blood
Congeald
with
this
do
make
me
wipe
off
both
with
drum
and
trumpets
Welcome
my
lord
to
this
brave
town
of
York
Yonders
the
head
of
that
archenemy
That
sought
to
be
encompassd
with
your
crown
Doth
not
the
object
cheer
your
heart
my
lord
Ay
as
the
rocks
cheer
them
that
fear
their
wreck
To
see
this
sight
it
irks
my
very
soul
Withhold
revenge
dear
God
tis
not
my
fault
Nor
wittingly
have
I
infringd
my
vow
My
gracious
liege
this
too
much
lenity
And
harmful
pity
must
be
laid
aside
To
whom
do
lions
cast
their
gentle
looks
Not
to
the
beast
that
would
usurp
their
den
Whose
hand
is
that
the
forest
bear
doth
lick
Not
his
that
spoils
her
young
before
her
face
Who
scapes
the
lurking
serpents
mortal
sting
Not
he
that
sets
his
foot
upon
her
back
The
smallest
worm
will
turn
being
trodden
on
And
doves
will
peck
in
safeguard
of
their
brood
Ambitious
York
did
level
at
thy
crown
Thou
smiling
while
he
knit
his
angry
brows
He
but
a
Duke
would
have
his
son
a
king
And
raise
his
issue
like
a
loving
sire
Thou
being
a
king
blessd
with
a
goodly
son
Didst
yield
consent
to
disinherit
him
Which
argued
thee
a
most
unloving
father
Unreasonable
creatures
feed
their
young
And
though
mans
face
be
fearful
to
their
eyes
Yet
in
protection
of
their
tender
ones
Who
hath
not
seen
them
even
with
those
wings
Which
sometime
they
have
usd
with
fearful
flight
Make
war
with
him
that
climbd
unto
their
nest
Offering
their
own
lives
in
their
youngs
defence
For
shame
my
liege
make
them
your
precedent
Were
it
not
pity
that
this
goodly
boy
Should
lose
his
birthright
by
his
fathers
fault
And
long
hereafter
say
unto
his
child
What
my
greatgrandfather
and
grandsire
got
My
careless
father
fondly
gave
away
Ah
what
a
shame
were
this
Look
on
the
boy
And
let
his
manly
face
which
promiseth
Successful
fortune
steel
thy
melting
heart
To
hold
thine
own
and
leave
thine
own
with
him
Full
well
hath
Clifford
playd
the
orator
Inferring
arguments
of
mighty
force
But
Clifford
tell
me
didst
thou
never
hear
That
things
ill
got
had
ever
bad
success
And
happy
always
was
it
for
that
son
Whose
father
for
his
hoarding
went
to
hell
Ill
leave
my
son
my
virtuous
deeds
behind
And
would
my
father
had
left
me
no
more
For
all
the
rest
is
held
at
such
a
rate
As
brings
a
thousandfold
more
care
to
keep
Than
in
possession
any
jot
of
pleasure
Ah
cousin
York
would
thy
best
friends
did
know
How
it
doth
grieve
me
that
thy
head
is
here
My
lord
cheer
up
your
spirits
our
foes
are
nigh
And
this
soft
courage
makes
your
followers
faint
You
promisd
knighthood
to
our
forward
son
Unsheathe
your
sword
and
dub
him
presently
Edward
kneel
down
Edward
Plantagenet
arise
a
knight
And
learn
this
lesson
Draw
thy
sword
in
right
My
gracious
father
by
your
kingly
leave
Ill
draw
it
as
apparent
to
the
crown
And
in
that
quarrel
use
it
to
the
death
Why
that
is
spoken
like
a
toward
prince
Enter
a
Royal
commanders
be
in
readiness
For
with
a
band
of
thirty
thousand
men
Comes
Warwick
backing
of
the
Duke
of
York
And
in
the
towns
as
they
do
march
along
Proclaims
him
king
and
many
fly
to
him
Darraign
your
battle
for
they
are
at
hand
I
would
your
Highness
would
depart
the
field
The
Queen
hath
best
success
when
you
are
absent
Ay
good
my
lord
and
leave
us
to
our
fortune
Why
thats
my
fortune
too
therefore
Ill
stay
Be
it
with
resolution
then
to
fight
My
royal
father
cheer
these
noble
lords
And
hearten
those
that
fight
in
your
defence
Unsheathe
your
sword
good
father
cry
Saint
George
March
Enter
and
soldiers
Now
perjurd
Henry
wilt
thou
kneel
for
grace
And
set
thy
diadem
upon
my
head
Or
bide
the
mortal
fortune
of
the
field
Go
rate
thy
minions
proud
insulting
boy
Becomes
it
thee
to
be
thus
bold
in
terms
Before
thy
sovereign
and
thy
lawful
king
I
am
his
king
and
he
should
bow
his
knee
I
was
adopted
heir
by
his
consent
Since
when
his
oath
is
broke
for
as
I
hear
You
that
are
King
though
he
do
wear
the
crown
Have
causd
him
by
new
act
of
parliament
To
blot
out
me
and
put
his
own
son
in
And
reason
too
Who
should
succeed
the
father
but
the
son
Are
you
there
butcher
I
cannot
speak
Ay
crookback
here
I
stand
to
answer
thee
Or
any
he
the
proudest
of
thy
sort
Twas
you
that
killd
young
Rutland
was
it
not
Ay
and
old
York
and
yet
not
satisfied
For
Gods
sake
lords
give
signal
to
the
fight
What
sayst
thou
Henry
Wilt
thou
yield
the
crown
Why
how
now
longtongud
Warwick
Dare
you
speak
When
you
and
I
met
at
Saint
Albans
last
Your
legs
did
better
service
than
your
hands
Then
twas
my
turn
to
fly
and
now
tis
thine
You
said
so
much
before
and
yet
you
fled
Twas
not
your
valour
Clifford
drove
me
thence
No
nor
your
manhood
that
durst
make
you
stay
Northumberland
I
hold
thee
reverently
Break
off
the
parley
for
scarce
I
can
refrain
The
execution
of
my
bigswoln
heart
Upon
that
Clifford
that
cruel
childkiller
I
slew
thy
father
callst
thou
him
a
child
Ay
like
a
dastard
and
a
treacherous
coward
As
thou
didst
kill
our
tender
brother
Rutland
But
ere
sunset
Ill
make
thee
curse
the
deed
Have
done
with
words
my
lords
and
hear
me
speak
Defy
them
then
or
else
hold
close
thy
lips
I
prithee
give
no
limits
to
my
tongue
I
am
a
king
and
privilegd
to
speak
My
liege
the
wound
that
bred
this
meeting
here
Cannot
be
curd
by
words
therefore
be
still
Then
executioner
unsheathe
thy
sword
By
Him
that
made
us
all
I
am
resolvd
That
Cliffords
manhood
lies
upon
his
tongue
Say
Henry
shall
I
have
my
right
or
no
thousand
men
have
broke
their
fasts
today
That
neer
shall
dine
unless
thou
yield
the
crown
If
thou
deny
their
blood
upon
thy
head
For
York
in
justice
puts
his
armour
on
If
that
be
right
which
Warwick
says
is
right
There
is
no
wrong
but
every
thing
is
right
Whoever
got
thee
there
thy
mother
stands
For
well
I
wot
thou
hast
thy
mothers
tongue
But
thou
art
neither
like
thy
sire
nor
dam
But
like
a
foul
misshapen
stigmatic
Markd
by
the
destinies
to
be
avoided
As
venom
toads
or
lizards
dreadful
stings
Iron
of
Naples
hid
with
English
gilt
Whose
father
bears
the
title
of
a
king
As
if
a
channel
should
be
calld
the
sea
Shamst
thou
not
knowing
whence
thou
art
extraught
To
let
thy
tongue
detect
thy
baseborn
heart
wisp
of
straw
were
worth
a
thousand
crowns
To
make
this
shameless
callet
know
herself
Helen
of
Greece
was
fairer
far
than
thou
Although
thy
husband
may
be
Menelaus
And
neer
was
Agamemmons
brother
wrongd
By
that
false
woman
as
this
king
by
thee
His
father
revelld
in
the
heart
of
France
And
tamd
the
King
and
made
the
Dauphin
stoop
And
had
he
matchd
according
to
his
state
He
might
have
kept
that
glory
to
this
day
But
when
he
took
a
beggar
to
his
bed
And
gracd
thy
poor
sire
with
his
bridal
day
Even
then
that
sunshine
brewd
a
showr
for
him
That
washd
his
fathers
fortunes
forth
of
France
And
heapd
sedition
on
his
crown
at
home
For
what
hath
broachd
this
tumult
but
thy
pride
Hadst
thou
been
meek
our
title
still
had
slept
And
we
in
pity
of
the
gentle
King
Had
slippd
our
claim
until
another
age
But
when
we
saw
our
sunshine
made
thy
spring
And
that
thy
summer
bred
us
no
increase
We
set
the
axe
to
thy
usurping
root
And
though
the
edge
hath
something
hit
ourselves
Yet
know
thou
since
we
have
begun
to
strike
Well
never
leave
till
we
have
hewn
thee
down
Or
bathd
thy
growing
with
our
heated
bloods
And
in
this
resolution
I
defy
thee
Not
willing
any
longer
conference
Since
thou
deniest
the
gentle
King
to
speak
Sound
trumpets
let
our
bloody
colours
wave
And
either
victory
or
else
a
grave
Stay
Edward
No
wrangling
woman
well
no
longer
stay
These
words
will
cost
ten
thousand
lives
this
day
Now
Clifford
I
have
singled
thee
alone
Suppose
this
arm
is
for
the
Duke
of
York
And
this
for
Rutland
both
bound
to
revenge
Wert
thou
environd
with
a
brazen
wall
Now
Richard
I
am
with
thee
here
alone
This
is
the
hand
that
stabbed
thy
father
York
And
this
the
hand
that
slew
thy
brother
Rutland
And
heres
the
heart
that
triumphs
in
their
death
And
cheers
these
hands
that
slew
thy
sire
and
brother
To
execute
the
like
upon
thyself
And
so
have
at
thee
They
fight
Enter
flies
Nay
Warwick
single
out
some
other
chase
For
I
myself
will
hunt
this
wolf
to
death
loud
alarum
Enter
wounded
Here
burns
my
candle
out
ay
here
it
dies
Which
whiles
it
lasted
gave
King
Henry
light
Lancaster
I
fear
thy
overthrow
More
than
my
bodys
parting
with
my
soul
My
love
and
fear
glud
many
friends
to
thee
And
now
I
fall
thy
tough
commixture
melts
Impairing
Henry
strengthning
misproud
York
The
common
people
swarm
like
summer
flies
And
whither
fly
the
gnats
but
to
the
sun
And
who
shines
now
but
Henrys
enemies
Phoebus
hadst
thou
never
given
consent
That
Phaethon
should
check
thy
fiery
steeds
Thy
burning
car
never
had
scorchd
the
earth
And
Henry
hadst
thou
swayd
as
kings
should
do
Or
as
thy
father
and
his
father
did
Giving
no
ground
unto
the
house
of
York
They
never
then
had
sprung
like
summer
flies
I
and
ten
thousand
in
this
luckless
realm
Had
left
no
mourning
widows
for
our
death
And
thou
this
day
hadst
kept
thy
chair
in
peace
For
what
doth
cherish
weeds
but
gentle
air
And
what
makes
robbers
bold
but
too
much
lenity
Bootless
are
plaints
and
cureless
are
my
wounds
No
way
to
fly
nor
strength
to
hold
out
flight
The
foe
is
merciless
and
will
not
pity
For
at
their
hands
I
have
deservd
no
pity
The
air
hath
got
into
my
deadly
wounds
And
much
effuse
of
blood
doth
make
me
faint
Come
York
and
Richard
Warwick
and
the
rest
I
stabbd
your
fathers
bosoms
split
my
breast
He
faints
Alarum
and
retreat
Enter
and
soldiers
Now
breathe
we
lords
Good
fortune
bids
us
pause
And
smooth
the
frowns
of
war
with
peaceful
looks
Some
troops
pursue
the
bloodyminded
Queen
That
led
calm
Henry
though
he
were
a
king
As
doth
a
sail
filld
with
a
fretting
gust
Command
an
argosy
to
stern
the
waves
But
think
you
lords
that
Clifford
fled
with
them
No
tis
impossible
he
should
escape
For
though
before
his
face
I
speak
the
words
Your
brother
Richard
markd
him
for
the
grave
And
wheresoer
he
is
hes
surely
dead
groans
and
dies
Whose
soul
is
that
which
takes
her
heavy
leave
deadly
groan
like
life
and
deaths
departing
See
who
it
is
And
now
the
battles
ended
If
friend
or
foe
let
him
be
gently
used
Revoke
that
doom
of
mercy
for
tis
Clifford
Who
not
contented
that
he
loppd
the
branch
In
hewing
Rutland
when
his
leaves
put
forth
But
set
his
murdring
knife
unto
the
root
From
whence
that
tender
spray
did
sweetly
spring
I
mean
our
princely
father
Duke
of
York
From
off
the
gates
of
York
fetch
down
the
head
Your
fathers
head
which
Clifford
placed
there
Instead
whereof
let
this
supply
the
room
Measure
for
measure
must
be
answered
Bring
forth
that
fatal
screechowl
to
our
house
That
nothing
sung
but
death
to
us
and
ours
Now
death
shall
stop
his
dismal
threatning
sound
And
his
illboding
tongue
no
more
shall
speak
I
think
his
understanding
is
bereft
Speak
Clifford
dost
thou
know
who
speaks
to
thee
Dark
cloudy
death
oershades
his
beams
of
life
And
he
nor
sees
nor
hears
us
what
we
say
would
he
did
and
so
perhaps
he
doth
Tis
but
his
policy
to
counterfeit
Because
he
would
avoid
such
bitter
taunts
Which
in
the
time
of
death
he
gave
our
father
If
so
thou
thinkst
vex
him
with
eager
words
Clifford
ask
mercy
and
obtain
no
grace
Clifford
repent
in
bootless
penitence
Clifford
devise
excuses
for
thy
faults
While
we
devise
fell
tortures
for
thy
faults
Thou
didst
love
York
and
I
am
son
to
York
Thou
pitiedst
Rutland
I
will
pity
thee
Wheres
Captain
Margaret
to
fence
you
now
They
mock
thee
Clifford
swear
as
thou
wast
wont
What
not
an
oath
Nay
then
the
world
goes
hard
When
Clifford
cannot
spare
his
friends
an
oath
I
know
by
that
hes
dead
and
by
my
soul
If
this
right
hand
would
buy
two
hours
life
That
I
in
all
despite
might
rail
at
him
This
hand
should
chop
it
off
and
with
the
issuing
blood
Stifle
the
villain
whose
unstanched
thirst
York
and
young
Rutland
could
not
satisfy
Ay
but
hes
dead
Off
with
the
traitors
head
And
rear
it
in
the
place
your
fathers
stands
And
now
to
London
with
triumphant
march
There
to
be
crowned
Englands
royal
King
From
whence
shall
Warwick
cut
the
sea
to
France
And
ask
the
Lady
Bona
for
thy
queen
So
shalt
thou
sinew
both
these
lands
together
And
having
France
thy
friend
thou
shalt
not
dread
The
scattred
foe
that
hopes
to
rise
again
For
though
they
cannot
greatly
sting
to
hurt
Yet
look
to
have
them
buzz
to
offend
thine
ears
First
will
I
see
the
coronation
And
then
to
Brittany
Ill
cross
the
sea
To
effect
this
marriage
so
it
please
my
lord
Even
as
thou
wilt
sweet
Warwick
let
it
be
For
in
thy
shoulder
do
I
build
my
seat
And
never
will
I
undertake
the
thing
Wherein
thy
counsel
and
consent
is
wanting
Richard
I
will
create
thee
Duke
of
Gloucester
And
George
of
Clarence
Warwick
as
ourself
Shall
do
and
undo
as
him
pleaseth
best
Let
me
be
Duke
of
Clarence
George
of
Gloucester
For
Gloucesters
dukedom
is
too
ominous
Tut
thats
a
foolish
observation
Richard
be
Duke
of
Gloucester
Now
to
London
To
see
these
honours
in
possession
I
chase
in
the
north
of
England
Enter
two
with
crossbows
in
their
hands
Under
this
thickgrown
brake
well
shroud
ourselves
For
through
this
laund
anon
the
deer
will
come
And
in
this
covert
will
we
make
our
stand
Culling
the
principal
of
all
the
deer
Ill
stay
above
the
hill
so
both
may
shoot
That
cannot
be
the
noise
of
thy
crossbow
Will
scare
the
herd
and
so
my
shoot
is
lost
Here
stand
we
both
and
aim
we
at
the
best
And
for
the
time
shall
not
seem
tedious
Ill
tell
thee
what
befell
me
on
a
day
In
this
selfplace
where
now
we
mean
to
stand
Here
comes
a
man
lets
stay
till
he
be
past
Enter
disguised
with
a
prayerbook
From
Scotland
am
I
stoln
even
of
pure
love
To
greet
mine
own
land
with
my
wishful
sight
No
Harry
Harry
tis
no
land
of
thine
Thy
place
is
filld
thy
sceptre
wrung
from
thee
Thy
balm
washd
off
wherewith
thou
wast
anointed
No
bending
knee
will
call
thee
Caesar
now
No
humble
suitors
press
to
speak
for
right
No
not
a
man
comes
for
redress
of
thee
For
how
can
I
help
them
and
not
myself
Ay
heres
a
deer
whose
skins
a
keepers
fee
This
is
the
quondam
King
lets
seize
upon
him
Let
me
embrace
thee
sour
adversity
For
wise
men
say
it
is
the
wisest
course
Why
linger
we
let
us
lay
hands
upon
him
Forbear
awhile
well
hear
a
little
more
My
Queen
and
son
are
gone
to
France
for
aid
And
as
I
hear
the
great
commanding
Warwick
Is
thither
gone
to
crave
the
French
Kings
sister
To
wife
for
Edward
If
this
news
be
true
Poor
queen
and
son
your
labour
is
but
lost
For
Warwick
is
a
subtle
orator
And
Lewis
a
prince
soon
won
with
moving
words
By
this
account
then
Margaret
may
win
him
For
shes
a
woman
to
be
pitied
much
Her
sighs
will
make
a
battry
in
his
breast
Her
tears
will
pierce
into
a
marble
heart
The
tiger
will
be
mild
whiles
she
doth
mourn
And
Nero
will
be
tainted
with
remorse
To
hear
and
see
her
plaints
her
brinish
tears
Ay
but
shes
come
to
beg
Warwick
to
give
She
on
his
left
side
craving
aid
for
Henry
He
on
his
right
asking
a
wife
for
Edward
She
weeps
and
says
her
Henry
is
deposd
He
smiles
and
says
his
Edward
is
installd
That
she
poor
wretch
for
grief
can
speak
no
more
Whiles
Warwick
tells
his
title
smooths
the
wrong
Inferreth
arguments
of
mighty
strength
And
in
conclusion
wins
the
King
from
her
With
promise
of
his
sister
and
what
else
To
strengthen
and
support
King
Edwards
place
Margaret
thus
twill
be
and
thou
poor
soul
Art
then
forsaken
as
thou
wentst
forlorn
Say
what
art
thou
that
talkst
of
kings
and
queens
More
than
I
seem
and
less
than
I
was
born
to
man
at
least
for
less
I
should
not
be
And
men
may
talk
of
kings
and
why
not
I
Ay
but
thou
talkst
as
if
thou
wert
a
king
Why
so
I
am
in
mind
and
thats
enough
But
if
thou
be
a
king
where
is
thy
crown
My
crown
is
in
my
heart
not
on
my
head
Not
deckd
with
diamonds
and
Indian
stones
Not
to
be
seen
My
crown
is
calld
content
crown
it
is
that
seldom
kings
enjoy
Well
if
you
be
a
king
crownd
with
content
Your
crown
content
and
you
must
be
contented
To
go
along
with
us
for
as
we
think
You
are
the
king
King
Edward
hath
deposd
And
we
his
subjects
sworn
in
all
allegiance
Will
apprehend
you
as
his
enemy
But
did
you
never
swear
and
break
an
oath
No
never
such
an
oath
nor
will
not
now
Where
did
you
dwell
when
I
was
King
of
England
Here
in
this
country
where
we
now
remain
I
was
anointed
king
at
nine
months
old
My
father
and
my
grandfather
were
kings
And
you
were
sworn
true
subjects
unto
me
And
tell
me
then
have
you
not
broke
your
oaths
No
For
we
were
subjects
but
while
you
were
king
Why
am
I
dead
Do
I
not
breathe
a
man
Ah
simple
men
you
know
not
what
you
swear
Look
as
I
blow
this
feather
from
my
face
And
as
the
air
blows
it
to
me
again
Obeying
with
my
wind
when
I
do
blow
And
yielding
to
another
when
it
blows
Commanded
always
by
the
greater
gust
Such
is
the
lightness
of
you
common
men
But
do
not
break
your
oaths
for
of
that
sin
My
mild
entreaty
shall
not
make
you
guilty
Go
where
you
will
the
King
shall
be
commanded
And
be
you
kings
command
and
Ill
obey
We
are
true
subjects
to
the
King
King
Edward
So
would
you
be
again
to
Henry
If
he
were
seated
as
King
Edward
is
We
charge
you
in
Gods
name
and
the
Kings
To
go
with
us
unto
the
officers
In
Gods
name
lead
your
Kings
name
be
obeyd
And
what
God
will
that
let
your
King
perform
And
what
he
will
I
humbly
yield
unto
Fair
Queen
of
England
worthy
Margaret
Sit
down
with
us
It
ill
befits
thy
state
And
birth
that
thou
shouldst
stand
while
Lewis
doth
sit
No
mighty
King
of
France
Now
Margaret
Must
strike
her
sail
and
learn
a
while
to
serve
Where
kings
command
I
was
I
must
confess
Great
Albions
Queen
in
former
golden
days
But
now
mischance
hath
trod
my
title
down
And
with
dishonour
laid
me
on
the
ground
Where
I
must
take
like
seat
unto
my
fortune
And
to
my
humble
seat
conform
myself
Why
say
fair
Queen
whence
springs
this
deep
despair
From
such
a
cause
as
fills
mine
eyes
with
tears
And
stops
my
tongue
while
heart
is
drownd
in
cares
Whateer
it
be
be
thou
still
like
thyself
And
sit
thee
by
our
side
Seats
her
by
him
Yield
not
thy
neck
To
fortunes
yoke
but
let
thy
dauntless
mind
Still
ride
in
triumph
over
all
mischance
Be
plain
Queen
Margaret
and
tell
thy
grief
It
shall
be
easd
if
France
can
yield
relief
Those
gracious
words
revive
my
drooping
thoughts
And
give
my
tonguetied
sorrows
leave
to
speak
Now
therefore
be
it
known
to
noble
Lewis
That
Henry
sole
possessor
of
my
love
Is
of
a
king
become
a
banishd
man
And
forcd
to
live
in
Scotland
a
forlorn
While
proud
ambitious
Edward
Duke
of
York
Usurps
the
regal
title
and
the
seat
Of
Englands
trueanointed
lawful
King
This
is
the
cause
that
I
poor
Margaret
With
this
my
son
Prince
Edward
Henrys
heir
Am
come
to
crave
thy
just
and
lawful
aid
And
if
thou
fail
us
all
our
hope
is
done
Scotland
hath
will
to
help
but
cannot
help
Our
people
and
our
peers
are
both
misled
Our
treasure
seizd
our
soldiers
put
to
flight
And
as
thou
seest
ourselves
in
heavy
plight
Renowned
Queen
with
patience
calm
the
storm
While
we
bethink
a
means
to
break
it
off
The
more
we
stay
the
stronger
grows
our
foe
The
more
I
stay
the
more
Ill
succour
thee
but
impatience
waiteth
on
true
sorrow
And
see
where
comes
the
breeder
of
my
sorrow
Enter
Whats
he
approacheth
boldly
to
our
presence
Our
Earl
of
Warwick
Edwards
greatest
friend
Welcome
brave
Warwick
What
brings
thee
to
France
He
descends
She
ariseth
Ay
now
begins
a
second
storm
to
rise
For
this
is
he
that
moves
both
wind
and
tide
From
worthy
Edward
King
of
Albion
My
lord
and
sovereign
and
thy
vowed
friend
I
come
in
kindness
and
unfeigned
love
First
to
do
greetings
to
thy
royal
person
And
then
to
crave
a
league
of
amity
And
lastly
to
confirm
that
amity
With
nuptial
knot
if
thou
vouchsafe
to
grant
That
virtuous
Lady
Bona
thy
fair
sister
To
Englands
King
in
lawful
marriage
Aside
If
that
go
forward
Henrys
hope
is
done
To
And
gracious
madam
in
our
kings
behalf
I
am
commanded
with
your
leave
and
favour
Humbly
to
kiss
your
hand
and
with
my
tongue
To
tell
the
passion
of
my
sovereigns
heart
Where
fame
late
entring
at
his
heedful
ears
Hath
placd
thy
beautys
image
and
thy
virtue
King
Lewis
and
Lady
Bona
hear
me
speak
Before
you
answer
Warwick
His
demand
Springs
not
from
Edwards
wellmeant
honest
love
But
from
deceit
bred
by
necessity
For
how
can
tyrants
safely
govern
home
Unless
abroad
they
purchase
great
alliance
To
prove
him
tyrant
this
reason
may
suffice
That
Henry
liveth
still
but
were
he
dead
Yet
here
Prince
Edward
stands
King
Henrys
son
Look
therefore
Lewis
that
by
this
league
and
marriage
Thou
draw
not
on
thy
danger
and
dishonour
For
though
usurpers
sway
the
rule
a
while
Yet
heavns
are
just
and
time
suppresseth
wrongs
Injurious
Margaret
And
why
not
Queen
Because
thy
father
Henry
did
usurp
And
thou
no
more
art
prince
than
she
is
queen
Then
Warwick
disannuls
great
John
of
Gaunt
Which
did
subdue
the
greatest
part
of
Spain
And
after
John
of
Gaunt
Henry
the
Fourth
Whose
wisdom
was
a
mirror
to
the
wisest
And
after
that
wise
prince
Henry
the
Fifth
Who
by
his
prowess
conquered
all
France
From
these
our
Henry
lineally
descends
Oxford
how
haps
it
in
this
smooth
discourse
You
told
not
how
Henry
the
Sixth
hath
lost
All
that
which
Henry
the
Fifth
had
gotten
Methinks
these
peers
of
France
should
smile
at
that
But
for
the
rest
you
tell
a
pedigree
Of
threescore
and
two
years
a
silly
time
To
make
prescription
for
a
kingdoms
worth
Why
Warwick
canst
thou
speak
against
thy
liege
Whom
thou
obeyedst
thirty
and
six
years
And
not
betray
thy
treason
with
a
blush
Can
Oxford
that
did
ever
fence
the
right
Now
buckler
falsehood
with
a
pedigree
For
shame
Leave
Henry
and
call
Edward
king
Call
him
my
king
by
whose
injurious
doom
My
elder
brother
the
Lord
Aubrey
Vere
Was
done
to
death
and
more
than
so
my
father
Even
in
the
downfall
of
his
mellowd
years
When
nature
brought
him
to
the
door
of
death
No
Warwick
no
while
life
upholds
this
arm
This
arm
upholds
the
house
of
Lancaster
And
I
the
house
of
York
Queen
Margaret
Prince
Edward
and
Oxford
Vouchsafe
at
our
request
to
stand
aside
While
I
use
further
conference
with
Warwick
They
stand
aloof
Heavens
grant
that
Warwicks
words
bewitch
him
not
Now
Warwick
tell
me
even
upon
thy
conscience
Is
Edward
your
true
king
for
I
were
loath
To
link
with
him
that
were
not
lawful
chosen
Thereon
I
pawn
my
credit
and
mine
honour
But
is
he
gracious
in
the
peoples
eye
The
more
that
Henry
was
unfortunate
Then
further
all
dissembling
set
aside
Tell
me
for
truth
the
measure
of
his
love
Unto
our
sister
Bona
Such
it
seems
As
may
beseem
a
monarch
like
himself
Myself
have
often
heard
him
say
and
swear
That
this
his
love
was
an
eternal
plant
Whereof
the
root
was
fixd
in
virtues
ground
The
leaves
and
fruit
maintaind
with
beautys
sun
Exempt
from
envy
but
not
from
disdain
Unless
the
Lady
Bona
quit
his
pain
Now
sister
let
us
hear
your
firm
resolve
Your
grant
or
your
denial
shall
be
mine
To
Yet
I
confess
that
often
ere
this
day
When
I
have
heard
your
kings
desert
recounted
Mine
ear
hath
tempted
judgment
to
desire
Then
Warwick
thus
our
sister
shall
be
Edwards
And
now
forthwith
shall
articles
be
drawn
Touching
the
jointure
that
your
king
must
make
Which
with
her
dowry
shall
be
counterpoisd
Draw
near
Queen
Margaret
and
be
a
witness
That
Bona
shall
be
wife
to
the
English
king
To
Edward
but
not
to
the
English
king
Deceitful
Warwick
it
was
thy
device
By
this
alliance
to
make
void
my
suit
Before
thy
coming
Lewis
was
Henrys
friend
And
still
is
friend
to
him
and
Margaret
But
if
your
title
to
the
crown
be
weak
As
may
appear
by
Edwards
good
success
Then
tis
but
reason
that
I
be
releasd
From
giving
aid
which
late
I
promised
Yet
shall
you
have
all
kindness
at
my
hand
That
your
estate
requires
and
mine
can
yield
Henry
now
lives
in
Scotland
at
his
case
Where
having
nothing
nothing
can
he
lose
And
as
for
you
yourself
our
quondam
queen
You
have
a
father
able
to
maintain
you
And
better
twere
you
troubled
him
than
France
Peace
impudent
and
shameless
Warwick
Proud
setter
up
and
puller
down
of
kings
I
will
not
hence
till
with
my
talk
and
tears
Both
full
of
truth
I
make
King
Lewis
behold
Thy
sly
conveyance
and
thy
lords
false
love
For
both
of
you
are
birds
of
selfsame
feather
blowing
a
horn
within
Warwick
this
is
some
post
to
us
or
thee
Enter
the
My
lord
ambassador
these
letters
are
for
you
Sent
from
your
brother
Marquis
Montague
These
from
our
King
unto
your
Majesty
And
madam
these
for
you
from
whom
I
know
not
They
all
read
their
letters
I
like
it
well
that
our
fair
Queen
and
mistress
Smiles
at
her
news
while
Warwick
frowns
at
his
Nay
mark
how
Lewis
stamps
as
he
were
nettled
I
hope
alls
for
the
best
Warwick
what
are
thy
news
And
yours
fair
Queen
Mine
such
as
fill
my
heart
with
unhopd
joys
Mine
full
of
sorrow
and
hearts
discontent
What
has
your
king
married
the
Lady
Grey
And
now
to
soothe
your
forgery
and
his
Sends
me
a
paper
to
persuade
me
patience
Is
this
th
alliance
that
he
seeks
with
France
Dare
he
presume
to
scorn
us
in
this
manner
I
told
your
Majesty
as
much
before
This
proveth
Edwards
love
and
Warwicks
honesty
King
Lewis
I
here
protest
in
sight
of
heaven
And
by
the
hope
I
have
of
heavenly
bliss
That
I
am
clear
from
this
misdeed
of
Edwards
No
more
my
king
for
he
dishonours
me
But
most
himself
if
he
could
see
his
shame
Did
I
forget
that
by
the
house
of
York
My
father
came
untimely
to
his
death
Did
I
let
pass
th
abuse
done
to
my
niece
Did
I
impale
him
with
the
regal
crown
Did
I
put
Henry
from
his
native
right
And
am
I
guerdond
at
the
last
with
shame
Shame
on
himself
for
my
desert
is
honour
And
to
repair
my
honour
lost
for
him
I
here
renounce
him
and
return
to
Henry
My
noble
Queen
let
former
grudges
pass
And
henceforth
I
am
thy
true
servitor
I
will
revenge
his
wrong
to
Lady
Bona
And
replant
Henry
in
his
former
state
Warwick
these
words
have
turnd
my
hate
to
love
And
I
forgive
and
quite
forget
old
faults
And
joy
that
thou
becomst
King
Henrys
friend
So
much
his
friend
ay
his
unfeigned
friend
That
if
King
Lewis
vouchsafe
to
furnish
us
With
some
few
bands
of
chosen
soldiers
Ill
undertake
to
land
them
on
our
coast
And
force
the
tyrant
from
his
seat
by
war
Tis
not
his
newmade
bride
shall
succour
him
And
as
for
Clarence
as
my
letters
tell
me
Hes
very
likely
now
to
fall
from
him
For
matching
more
for
wanton
lust
than
honour
Or
than
for
strength
and
safety
of
our
country
Dear
brother
how
shall
Bona
be
revengd
But
by
thy
help
to
this
distressed
queen
Renowned
Prince
how
shall
poor
Henry
live
Unless
thou
rescue
him
from
foul
despair
My
quarrel
and
this
English
queens
are
one
And
mine
fair
Lady
Bona
joins
with
yours
And
mine
with
hers
and
thine
and
Margarets
Therefore
at
last
I
firmly
am
resolvd
You
shall
have
aid
Let
me
give
humble
thanks
for
all
at
once
Then
Englands
messenger
return
in
post
And
tell
false
Edward
thy
supposed
king
That
Lewis
of
France
is
sending
over
masquers
To
revel
it
with
him
and
his
new
bride
Thou
seest
whats
past
go
fear
thy
king
withal
Tell
him
in
hope
hell
prove
a
widower
shortly
Ill
wear
the
willowgarland
for
his
sake
Tell
him
my
mourning
weeds
are
laid
aside
And
I
am
ready
to
put
armour
on
Tell
him
from
me
that
he
hath
done
me
wrong
And
therefore
Ill
uncrown
him
eret
be
long
Theres
thy
reward
be
gone
But
Warwick
Thou
and
Oxford
with
five
thousand
men
Shall
cross
the
seas
and
bid
false
Edward
battle
And
as
occasion
serves
this
noble
Queen
And
Prince
shall
follow
with
a
fresh
supply
Yet
ere
thou
go
but
answer
me
one
doubt
What
pledge
have
we
of
thy
firm
loyalty
This
shall
assure
my
constant
loyalty
That
if
our
Queen
and
this
young
Prince
agree
Ill
join
mine
eldest
daughter
and
my
joy
To
him
forthwith
in
holy
wedlock
bands
Yes
I
agree
and
thank
you
for
your
motion
Son
Edward
she
is
fair
and
virtuous
Therefore
delay
not
give
thy
hand
to
Warwick
And
with
thy
hand
thy
faith
irrevocable
That
only
Warwicks
daughter
shall
be
thine
Yes
I
accept
her
for
she
well
deserves
it
And
here
to
pledge
my
vow
I
give
my
hand
He
gives
his
hand
to
stay
we
now
These
soldiers
shall
be
levied
And
thou
Lord
Bourbon
our
High
Admiral
Shall
waft
them
over
with
our
royal
fleet
I
long
till
Edward
fall
by
wars
mischance
For
mocking
marriage
with
a
dame
of
France
I
came
from
Edward
as
ambassador
But
I
return
his
sworn
and
mortal
foe
Matter
of
marriage
was
the
charge
he
gave
me
But
dreadful
war
shall
answer
his
demand
Had
he
none
else
to
make
a
stale
but
me
Then
none
but
I
shall
turn
his
jest
to
sorrow
I
was
the
chief
that
raisd
him
to
the
crown
And
Ill
be
chief
to
bring
him
down
again
Not
that
I
pity
Henrys
misery
But
seek
revenge
on
Edwards
mockery
I
London
The
palace
Enter
and
Now
tell
me
brother
Clarence
what
think
you
Of
this
new
marriage
with
the
Lady
Grey
Hath
not
our
brother
made
a
worthy
choice
Alas
you
know
tis
far
from
hence
to
France
How
could
he
stay
till
Warwick
made
return
My
lords
forbear
this
talk
here
comes
the
King
Flourish
Enter
attended
as
Queen
and
others
Four
stand
on
one
side
and
four
on
the
other
And
his
wellchosen
bride
I
mind
to
tell
him
plainly
what
I
think
Now
brother
of
Clarence
how
like
you
our
choice
That
you
stand
pensive
as
half
malcontent
As
well
as
Lewis
of
France
or
the
Earl
of
Warwick
Which
are
so
weak
of
courage
and
in
judgment
That
theyll
take
no
offence
at
our
abuse
Suppose
they
take
offence
without
a
cause
They
are
but
Lewis
and
Warwick
I
am
Edward
Your
King
and
Warwicks
and
must
have
my
will
And
shall
have
your
will
because
our
King
Yet
hasty
marriage
seldom
proveth
well
Yea
brother
Richard
are
you
offended
too
Not
I
No
God
forbid
that
I
should
wish
them
severd
Whom
God
hath
joind
together
ay
and
twere
pity
To
sunder
them
that
yoke
so
well
together
Setting
your
scorns
and
your
mislike
aside
Tell
me
some
reason
why
the
Lady
Grey
Should
not
become
my
wife
and
Englands
Queen
And
you
too
Somerset
and
Montague
Speak
freely
what
you
think
Then
this
is
mine
opinion
that
King
Lewis
Becomes
your
enemy
for
mocking
him
About
the
marriage
of
the
Lady
Bona
And
Warwick
doing
what
you
gave
in
charge
Is
now
dishonoured
by
this
new
marriage
What
if
both
Lewis
and
Warwick
be
appeasd
By
such
invention
as
I
can
devise
Yet
to
have
joind
with
France
in
such
alliance
Would
more
have
strengthned
this
our
commonwealth
Gainst
foreign
storms
than
any
homebred
marriage
Why
knows
not
Montague
that
of
itself
England
is
safe
if
true
within
itself
But
the
safer
when
tis
backd
with
France
Tis
better
using
France
than
trusting
France
Let
us
be
backd
with
God
and
with
the
seas
Which
He
hath
givn
for
fence
impregnable
And
with
their
helps
only
defend
ourselves
In
them
and
in
ourselves
our
safety
lies
For
this
one
speech
Lord
Hastings
well
deserves
To
have
the
heir
of
the
Lord
Hungerford
Ay
what
of
that
it
was
my
will
and
grant
And
for
this
once
my
will
shall
stand
for
law
And
yet
methinks
your
Grace
hath
not
done
well
To
give
the
heir
and
daughter
of
Lord
Scales
Unto
the
brother
of
your
loving
bride
She
better
would
have
fitted
me
or
Clarence
But
in
your
bride
you
bury
brotherhood
Or
else
you
would
not
have
bestowd
the
heir
Of
the
Lord
Bonville
on
your
new
wifes
son
And
leave
your
brothers
to
go
speed
elsewhere
Alas
poor
Clarence
Is
it
for
a
wife
That
thou
art
malcontent
I
will
provide
thee
In
choosing
for
yourself
you
showd
your
judgment
Which
being
shallow
you
shall
give
me
leave
To
play
the
broker
in
mine
own
behalf
And
to
that
end
I
shortly
mind
to
leave
you
Leave
me
or
tarry
Edward
will
be
King
And
not
be
tied
unto
his
brothers
will
My
lords
before
it
pleasd
his
Majesty
To
raise
my
state
to
title
of
a
queen
Do
me
but
right
and
you
must
all
confess
That
I
was
not
ignoble
of
descent
And
meaner
than
myself
have
had
like
fortune
But
as
this
title
honours
me
and
mine
So
your
dislikes
to
whom
I
would
be
pleasing
Doth
cloud
my
joys
with
danger
and
with
sorrow
My
love
forbear
to
fawn
upon
their
frowns
What
danger
or
what
sorrow
can
befall
thee
So
long
as
Edward
is
thy
constant
friend
And
their
true
sovereign
whom
they
must
obey
Nay
whom
they
shall
obey
and
love
thee
too
Unless
they
seek
for
hatred
at
my
hands
Which
if
they
do
yet
will
I
keep
thee
safe
And
they
shall
feel
the
vengeance
of
my
wrath
Aside
I
hear
yet
say
not
much
but
think
the
more
Enter
a
Now
messenger
what
letters
or
what
news
From
France
My
sovereign
liege
no
letters
and
few
words
But
such
as
I
without
your
special
pardon
Dare
not
relate
Go
to
we
pardon
thee
therefore
in
brief
Tell
me
their
words
as
near
as
thou
canst
guess
them
What
answer
makes
King
Lewis
unto
our
letters
At
my
depart
these
were
his
very
words
Go
tell
false
Edward
the
supposed
king
That
Lewis
of
France
is
sending
over
masquers
To
revel
it
with
him
and
his
new
bride
Lewis
so
brave
Belike
he
thinks
me
Henry
But
what
said
Lady
Bona
to
my
marriage
These
were
her
words
uttred
with
mild
disdain
Tell
him
in
hope
hell
prove
a
widower
shortly
Ill
wear
the
willowgarland
for
his
sake
I
blame
not
her
she
could
say
little
less
She
had
the
wrong
But
what
said
Henrys
queen
For
I
have
heard
that
she
was
there
in
place
Tell
him
quoth
she
my
mourning
weeds
are
done
And
I
am
ready
to
put
armour
on
Belike
she
minds
to
play
the
Amazon
But
what
said
Warwick
to
these
injuries
He
more
incensd
against
your
Majesty
Than
all
the
rest
dischargd
me
with
these
words
Tell
him
from
me
that
he
hath
done
me
wrong
And
therefore
Ill
uncrown
him
eret
be
long
Ha
durst
the
traitor
breathe
out
so
proud
words
Well
I
will
arm
me
being
thus
forewarnd
They
shall
have
wars
and
pay
for
their
presumption
But
say
is
Warwick
friends
with
Margaret
Ay
gracious
sovereign
they
are
so
linkd
in
friendship
That
young
Prince
Edward
marries
Warwicks
daughter
Belike
the
elder
Clarence
will
have
the
younger
Now
brother
king
farewell
and
sit
you
fast
For
I
will
hence
to
Warwicks
other
daughter
That
though
I
want
a
kingdom
yet
in
marriage
I
may
not
prove
inferior
to
yourself
You
that
love
me
and
Warwick
follow
me
Aside
Not
I
My
thoughts
aim
at
a
further
matter
I
Stay
not
for
the
love
of
Edward
but
the
crown
Clarence
and
Somerset
both
gone
to
Warwick
Yet
am
I
armd
against
the
worst
can
happen
And
haste
is
needful
in
this
desprate
case
Pembroke
and
Stafford
you
in
our
behalf
Go
levy
men
and
make
prepare
for
war
They
are
already
or
quickly
will
be
landed
Myself
in
person
will
straight
follow
you
But
ere
I
go
Hastings
and
Montague
Resolve
my
doubt
You
twain
of
all
the
rest
Are
near
to
Warwick
by
blood
and
by
alliance
Tell
me
if
you
love
Warwick
more
than
me
If
it
be
so
then
both
depart
to
him
I
rather
wish
you
foes
than
hollow
friends
But
if
you
mind
to
hold
your
true
obedience
Give
me
assurance
with
some
friendly
vow
That
I
may
never
have
you
in
suspect
So
God
help
Montague
as
he
proves
true
And
Hastings
as
he
favours
Edwards
cause
Now
brother
Richard
will
you
stand
by
us
Ay
in
despite
of
all
that
shall
withstand
you
Why
so
then
am
I
sure
of
victory
Now
therefore
let
us
hence
and
lose
no
hour
Till
we
meet
Warwick
with
his
foreign
powr
Come
on
my
masters
each
man
take
his
stand
The
King
by
this
is
set
him
down
to
sleep
What
will
he
not
to
bed
Why
no
for
he
hath
made
a
solemn
vow
Never
to
lie
and
take
his
natural
rest
Till
Warwick
or
himself
be
quite
suppressd
Tomorrow
then
belike
shall
be
the
day
If
Warwick
be
so
near
as
men
report
But
say
I
pray
what
nobleman
is
that
That
with
the
King
here
resteth
in
his
tent
Tis
the
Lord
Hastings
the
Kings
chiefest
friend
is
it
So
But
why
commands
the
King
That
his
chief
followers
lodge
in
towns
about
him
While
he
himself
keeps
in
the
cold
field
Tis
the
more
honour
because
more
dangerous
Ay
but
give
me
worship
and
quietness
I
like
it
better
than
dangerous
honour
If
Warwick
knew
in
what
estate
he
stands
Tis
to
be
doubted
he
would
waken
him
Unless
our
halberds
did
shut
up
his
passage
Ay
wherefore
else
guard
we
his
royal
tent
But
to
defend
his
person
from
nightfoes
Enter
and
French
soldiers
silent
all
This
is
his
tent
and
see
where
stand
his
guard
Courage
my
masters
Honour
now
or
never
But
follow
me
and
Edward
shall
be
ours
Who
goes
there
Stay
or
thou
diest
and
the
rest
cry
all
Warwick
Warwick
and
set
upon
the
guard
who
fly
crying
Arm
Arm
and
the
rest
following
them
The
drum
playing
and
trumpet
sounding
reenter
and
the
rest
bringing
the
out
in
his
gown
sitting
in
a
chair
and
fly
over
the
stage
What
are
they
that
fly
there
Richard
and
Hastings
Let
them
go
here
is
the
Duke
The
Duke
Why
Warwick
when
we
parted
Thou
calldst
me
King
Ay
but
the
case
is
alterd
When
you
disgracd
me
in
my
embassade
Then
I
degraded
you
from
being
King
And
come
now
to
create
you
Duke
of
York
Alas
how
should
you
govern
any
kingdom
That
know
not
how
to
use
ambassadors
Nor
how
to
be
contented
with
one
wife
Nor
how
to
use
your
brothers
brotherly
Nor
how
to
study
for
the
peoples
welfare
Nor
how
to
shroud
yourself
from
enemies
Yea
brother
of
Clarence
art
thou
here
too
Nay
then
I
see
that
Edward
needs
must
down
Yet
Warwick
in
despite
of
all
mischance
Of
thee
thyself
and
all
thy
complices
Edward
will
always
bear
himself
as
King
Though
fortunes
malice
overthrow
my
state
My
mind
exceeds
the
compass
of
her
wheel
Then
for
his
mind
be
Edward
Englands
king
Takes
off
his
crown
But
Henry
now
shall
wear
the
English
crown
And
be
true
King
indeed
thou
but
the
shadow
My
Lord
of
Somerset
at
my
request
See
that
forthwith
Duke
Edward
be
conveyd
Unto
my
brother
Archbishop
of
York
When
I
have
fought
with
Pembroke
and
his
fellows
Ill
follow
you
and
tell
what
answer
Lewis
and
the
Lady
Bona
send
to
him
Now
for
a
while
farewell
good
Duke
of
York
What
fates
impose
that
men
must
needs
abide
It
boots
not
to
resist
both
wind
and
tide
They
lead
him
out
forcibly
What
now
remains
my
lords
for
us
to
do
But
march
to
London
with
our
soldiers
Ay
thats
the
first
thing
that
we
have
to
do
To
free
King
Henry
from
imprisonment
And
see
him
seated
in
the
regal
throne
park
near
Middleham
Castle
in
Yorkshire
Enter
and
others
Now
my
Lord
Hastings
and
Sir
William
Stanley
Leave
off
to
wonder
why
I
drew
you
hither
Into
this
chiefest
thicket
of
the
park
Thus
stands
the
case
you
know
our
King
my
brother
Is
prisoner
to
the
Bishop
here
at
whose
hands
He
hath
good
usage
and
great
liberty
And
often
but
attended
with
weak
guard
Comes
hunting
this
way
to
disport
himself
I
have
advertisd
him
by
secret
means
That
if
about
this
hour
he
make
this
way
Under
the
colour
of
his
usual
game
He
shall
here
find
his
friends
with
horse
and
men
To
set
him
free
from
his
captivity
Enter
and
a
with
him
This
way
my
lord
for
this
way
lies
the
game
Nay
this
way
man
See
where
the
huntsmen
stand
Now
brother
of
Gloucester
Lord
Hastings
and
the
rest
Stand
you
thus
close
to
steal
the
Bishops
deer
Brother
the
time
and
case
requireth
haste
Your
horse
stands
ready
at
the
park
corner
But
whither
shall
we
then
To
Lynn
my
lord
and
shipt
from
thence
to
Flanders
Well
guessd
believe
me
for
that
was
my
meaning
Stanley
I
will
requite
thy
forwardness
But
wherefore
stay
we
Tis
no
time
to
talk
Huntsman
what
sayst
thou
Wilt
thou
go
along
Better
do
so
than
tarry
and
be
hangd
Come
then
away
lets
ha
no
more
ado
Bishop
farewell
Shield
thee
from
Warwicks
frown
And
pray
that
I
may
repossess
the
crown
Now
brother
Richard
Lord
Hastings
and
the
rest
Yet
thus
far
fortune
maketh
us
amends
And
says
that
once
more
I
shall
interchange
My
waned
state
for
Henrys
regal
crown
Well
have
we
passd
and
now
repassd
the
seas
And
brought
desired
help
from
Burgundy
What
then
remains
we
being
thus
arrivd
From
Ravenspurgh
haven
before
the
gates
of
York
But
that
we
enter
as
into
our
dukedom
The
gates
made
fast
Brother
I
like
not
this
For
many
men
that
stumble
at
the
threshold
Are
well
foretold
that
danger
lurks
within
Tush
man
abodements
must
not
now
affright
us
By
fair
or
foul
means
we
must
enter
in
For
hither
will
our
friends
repair
to
us
My
liege
Ill
knock
once
more
to
summon
them
Enter
on
the
walls
the
and
his
My
lords
we
were
forewarned
of
your
coming
And
shut
the
gates
for
safety
of
ourselves
For
now
we
owe
allegiance
unto
Henry
But
Master
Mayor
if
Henry
be
your
King
Yet
Edward
at
the
least
is
Duke
of
York
True
my
good
lord
I
know
you
for
no
less
Why
and
I
challenge
nothing
but
my
dukedom
As
being
well
content
with
that
alone
Aside
But
when
the
fox
hath
once
got
in
his
nose
Hell
soon
find
means
to
make
the
body
follow
Why
Master
Mayor
why
stand
you
in
a
doubt
Open
the
gates
we
are
King
Henrys
friends
Ay
say
you
so
The
gates
shall
then
be
opend
He
descends
wise
stout
captain
and
soon
persuaded
The
good
old
man
would
fain
that
all
were
well
So
twere
not
long
of
him
but
being
entred
I
doubt
not
I
but
we
shall
soon
persuade
Both
him
and
all
his
brothers
unto
reason
Enter
below
the
and
two
So
Master
Mayor
These
gates
must
not
be
shut
But
in
the
night
or
in
the
time
of
war
What
fear
not
man
but
yield
me
up
the
keys
Takes
his
keys
For
Edward
will
defend
the
town
and
thee
And
all
those
friends
that
deign
to
follow
me
March
Enter
with
drum
and
soldiers
Brother
this
is
Sir
John
Montgomery
Our
trusty
friend
unless
I
be
deceivd
Welcome
Sir
john
But
why
come
you
in
arms
To
help
King
Edward
in
his
time
of
storm
As
every
loyal
subject
ought
to
do
Thanks
good
Montgomery
but
we
now
forget
Our
title
to
the
crown
and
only
claim
Our
dukedom
till
God
please
to
send
the
rest
Then
fare
you
well
for
I
will
hence
again
I
came
to
serve
a
king
and
not
a
duke
Drummer
strike
up
and
let
us
march
away
The
drum
begins
to
march
Nay
stay
Sir
John
a
while
and
well
debate
By
what
safe
means
the
crown
may
be
recoverd
What
talk
you
of
debating
In
few
words
If
youll
not
here
proclaim
yourself
our
King
Ill
leave
you
to
your
fortune
and
be
gone
To
keep
them
back
that
come
to
succour
you
Why
shall
we
fight
if
you
pretend
no
title
Why
brother
wherefore
stand
you
on
nice
points
When
we
grow
stronger
then
well
make
our
claim
Till
then
tis
wisdom
to
conceal
our
meaning
Away
with
scrupulous
wit
Now
arms
must
rule
And
fearless
minds
climb
soonest
unto
crowns
Brother
we
will
proclaim
you
out
of
hand
The
bruit
thereof
will
bring
you
many
friends
Then
be
it
as
you
will
for
tis
my
right
And
Henry
but
usurps
the
diadem
Ay
now
my
sovereign
speaketh
like
himself
And
now
will
I
be
Edwards
champion
Sound
trumpet
Edward
shall
be
here
proclaimd
Come
fellow
soldier
make
thou
proclamation
Gives
him
a
paper
Flourish
Reads
Edward
the
Fourth
by
the
grace
of
God
King
of
England
and
France
and
Lord
of
Ireland
c
And
whosoer
gainsays
King
Edwards
right
By
this
I
challenge
him
to
single
fight
Throws
down
gauntlet
Long
live
Edward
the
Fourth
Thanks
brave
Montgomery
and
thanks
unto
you
all
If
fortune
serve
me
Ill
requite
this
kindness
Now
for
this
night
lets
harbour
here
in
York
And
when
the
morning
sun
shall
raise
his
car
Above
the
border
of
this
horizon
Well
forward
towards
Warwick
and
his
mates
For
well
I
wot
that
Henry
is
no
soldier
Ah
froward
Clarence
how
evil
it
beseems
the
To
flatter
Henry
and
forsake
thy
brother
Yet
as
we
may
well
meet
both
thee
and
Warwick
Come
on
brave
soldiers
doubt
not
of
the
day
And
that
once
gotten
doubt
not
of
large
pay
field
of
battle
near
Barnet
Alarum
and
excursions
Enter
bringing
forth
wounded
So
lie
thou
there
Die
thou
and
die
our
fear
For
Warwick
was
a
bug
that
feard
us
all
Now
Montague
sit
fast
I
seek
for
thee
That
Warwicks
bones
may
keep
thine
company
Ah
who
is
nigh
Come
to
me
friend
or
foe
And
tell
me
who
is
victor
York
or
Warwick
Why
ask
I
that
My
mangled
body
shows
My
blood
my
want
of
strength
my
sick
heart
shows
That
I
must
yield
my
body
to
the
earth
And
by
my
fall
the
conquest
to
my
foe
Thus
yields
the
cedar
to
the
axes
edge
Whose
arms
gave
shelter
to
the
princely
eagle
Under
whose
shade
the
ramping
lion
slept
Whose
topbranch
overpeerd
Joves
spreading
tree
And
kept
low
shrubs
from
winters
powrful
wind
These
eyes
that
now
are
dimmd
with
deaths
black
veil
Have
been
as
piercing
as
the
midday
sun
To
search
the
secret
treasons
of
the
world
The
wrinkles
in
my
brows
now
filld
with
blood
Were
likned
oft
to
kingly
sepulchres
For
who
livd
King
but
I
could
dig
his
grave
And
who
durst
smile
when
Warwick
bent
his
brow
Lo
now
my
glory
smeard
in
dust
and
blood
My
parks
my
walks
my
manors
that
I
had
Even
now
forsake
me
and
of
all
my
lands
Is
nothing
left
me
but
my
bodys
length
what
is
pomp
rule
reign
but
earth
and
dust
And
live
we
how
we
can
yet
die
we
must
Enter
and
Ah
Warwick
Warwick
wert
thou
as
we
are
We
might
recover
all
our
loss
again
The
Queen
from
France
hath
brought
a
puissant
power
Even
now
we
heard
the
news
Ah
couldst
thou
fly
Why
then
I
would
not
fly
Ah
Montague
If
thou
be
there
sweet
brother
take
my
hand
And
with
thy
lips
keep
in
my
soul
a
while
Thou
lovst
me
not
for
brother
if
thou
didst
Thy
tears
would
wash
this
cold
congealed
blood
That
glues
my
lips
and
will
not
let
me
speak
Come
quickly
Montague
or
I
am
dead
Ah
Warwick
Montague
hath
breathd
his
last
And
to
the
latest
gasp
cried
out
for
Warwick
And
said
Commend
me
to
my
valiant
brother
And
more
he
would
have
said
and
more
he
spoke
Which
sounded
like
a
clamour
in
a
vault
That
mought
not
be
distinguishd
but
at
last
I
well
might
hear
delivered
with
a
groan
farewell
Warwick
Sweet
rest
his
soul
Fly
lords
and
save
yourselves
For
Warwick
bids
you
all
farewell
to
meet
in
heaven
Dies
Away
away
to
meet
the
Queens
great
power
Here
they
bear
away
his
body
Great
lords
wise
men
neer
sit
and
wail
their
loss
But
cheerly
seek
how
to
redress
their
harms
What
though
the
mast
be
now
blown
overboard
The
cable
broke
the
holdinganchor
lost
And
half
our
sailors
swallowd
in
the
flood
Yet
lives
our
pilot
still
Ist
meet
that
he
Should
leave
the
helm
and
like
a
fearful
lad
With
tearful
eyes
add
water
to
the
sea
And
give
more
strength
to
that
which
hath
too
much
Whiles
in
his
moan
the
ship
splits
on
the
rock
Which
industry
and
courage
might
have
savd
Ah
what
a
shame
ah
what
a
fault
were
this
Say
Warwick
was
our
anchor
what
of
that
And
Montague
our
topmast
what
of
him
Our
slaughtred
friends
the
tackles
what
of
these
Why
is
not
Oxford
here
another
anchor
And
Somerset
another
goodly
mast
The
friends
of
France
our
shrouds
and
tacklings
And
though
unskilful
why
not
Ned
and
I
For
once
allowd
the
skilful
pilots
charge
We
will
not
from
the
helm
to
sit
and
weep
But
keep
our
course
though
the
rough
wind
say
no
From
shelves
and
rocks
that
threaten
us
with
wreck
As
good
to
chide
the
waves
as
speak
them
fair
And
what
is
Edward
but
a
ruthless
sea
What
Clarence
but
a
quicksand
of
deceit
And
Richard
but
a
ragged
fatal
rock
All
these
the
enemies
to
our
poor
bark
Say
you
can
swim
alas
tis
but
a
while
Tread
on
the
sand
why
there
you
quickly
sink
Bestride
the
rock
the
tide
will
wash
you
off
Or
else
you
famish
thats
a
threefold
death
This
speak
I
lords
to
let
you
understand
If
case
some
one
of
you
would
fly
from
us
That
theres
no
hopdfor
mercy
with
the
brothers
More
than
with
ruthless
waves
with
sands
and
rocks
Why
courage
then
What
cannot
be
avoided
Twere
childish
weakness
to
lament
or
fear
Methinks
a
woman
of
this
valiant
spirit
Should
if
a
coward
hear
her
speak
these
words
Infuse
his
breast
with
magnanimity
And
make
him
naked
foil
a
manatarms
I
speak
not
this
as
doubting
any
here
For
did
I
but
suspect
a
fearful
man
He
should
have
leave
to
go
away
betimes
Lest
in
our
need
he
might
infect
another
And
make
him
of
the
like
spirit
to
himself
If
any
such
be
here
as
God
forbid
Let
him
depart
before
we
need
his
help
Women
and
children
of
so
high
a
courage
And
warriors
faint
Why
twere
perpetual
shame
brave
young
Prince
thy
famous
grandfather
Doth
live
again
in
thee
Long
mayst
thou
Eve
To
bear
his
image
and
renew
his
glories
And
he
that
will
not
fight
for
such
a
hope
Go
home
to
bed
and
like
the
owl
by
day
If
he
arise
be
mockd
and
wondred
at
Thanks
gentle
Somerset
sweet
Oxford
thanks
And
take
his
thanks
that
yet
hath
nothing
else
Enter
a
Prepare
you
lords
for
Edward
is
at
hand
Ready
to
fight
therefore
be
resolute
I
thought
no
less
It
is
his
policy
To
haste
thus
fast
to
find
us
unprovided
But
hes
deceivd
we
are
in
readiness
This
cheers
my
heart
to
see
your
forwardness
Here
pitch
our
battle
hence
we
will
not
budge
Flourish
and
march
Enter
at
a
distance
and
soldiers
Brave
followers
yonder
stands
the
thorny
wood
Which
by
the
heavens
assistance
and
your
strength
Must
by
the
roots
be
hewn
up
yet
ere
night
I
need
not
add
more
fuel
to
your
fire
For
well
I
wot
ye
blaze
to
burn
them
out
Give
signal
to
the
fight
and
to
it
lords
Lords
knights
and
gentlemen
what
I
should
say
My
tears
gainsay
for
every
word
I
speak
Ye
see
I
drink
the
water
of
my
eye
Therefore
no
more
but
this
Henry
your
sovereign
Is
prisoner
to
the
foe
his
state
usurpd
His
realm
a
slaughterhouse
his
subjects
slain
His
statutes
cancelld
and
his
treasure
spent
And
yonder
is
the
wolf
that
makes
this
spoil
You
fight
in
justice
Then
in
Gods
name
lords
Be
valiant
and
give
signal
to
the
fight
Alarum
retreat
excursions
Good
day
my
lord
What
at
your
book
so
hard
Ay
my
good
lord
my
lord
I
should
say
rather
Tis
sin
to
flatter
good
was
little
better
Good
Gloucester
and
good
devil
were
alike
And
both
preposterous
therefore
not
good
lord
Sirrah
leave
us
to
ourselves
we
must
confer
So
flies
the
reckless
shepherd
from
the
wolf
So
first
the
harmless
sheep
doth
yield
his
fleece
And
next
his
throat
unto
the
butchers
knife
What
scene
of
death
hath
Roscius
now
to
act
Suspicion
always
haunts
the
guilty
mind
The
thief
doth
fear
each
bush
an
officer
The
bird
that
hath
been
limed
in
a
bush
With
trembling
wings
misdoubteth
every
bush
And
I
the
hapless
male
to
one
sweet
bird
Have
now
the
fatal
object
in
my
eye
Where
my
poor
young
was
limd
was
caught
and
killd
Why
what
a
peevish
fool
was
that
of
Crete
That
taught
his
son
the
office
of
a
fowl
And
yet
for
all
his
wings
the
fool
was
drownd
I
Daedalus
my
poor
boy
Icarus
Thy
father
Minos
that
denied
our
course
The
sun
that
seard
the
wings
of
my
sweet
boy
Thy
brother
Edward
and
thyself
the
sea
Whose
envious
gulf
did
swallow
up
his
life
Ah
kill
me
with
thy
weapon
not
with
words
My
breast
can
better
brook
thy
daggers
point
Than
can
my
ears
that
tragic
history
But
wherefore
dost
thou
come
Ist
for
my
life
Thinkst
thou
I
am
an
executioner
persecutor
I
am
sure
thou
art
If
murdering
innocents
be
executing
Why
then
thou
are
an
executioner
Thy
son
I
killd
for
his
presumption
Hadst
thou
been
killd
when
first
thou
didst
presume
Thou
hadst
not
livd
to
kill
a
son
of
mine
And
thus
I
prophesy
that
many
a
thousand
Which
now
mistrust
no
parcel
of
my
fear
And
many
an
old
mans
sigh
and
many
a
widows
And
many
an
orphans
waterstanding
eye
Men
for
their
sons
wives
for
their
husbands
Orphans
for
their
parents
timeless
death
Shall
rue
the
hour
that
ever
thou
wast

The

shriekd
at
thy

The

luckless

Dogs

hideous
tempest

The

And

Thy

felt
more

And

To

Not

the

a
goodly

Teeth
hadst
thou
in

when
thou
wast

To

thou

Dies
What

of

Sink

I

See

may
such

be

From

Down

I
that

neither

Indeed
tis
true
that
Henry
told
me
of
For
I
have
often
heard
my

say
I
came
into
the
world
with
my
legs
forward
Had
I
not
reason
think
ye
to

And
seek

ruin
that
usurpd

The

and
the

cried
Jesus
bless
us
he
is
born
with

And
so
I
was
which
plainly
signified
That
I
should
snarl

Then
since
the

have
shapd
my

Let

I

But
I
will
sort
a

For
I

Counting

Thus
after

In
my

to

The

strange

Silence
good

hear
the
embassy
Philip
of
France
in
right
and
true
behalf
Of
thy
deceased
brother
Geffreys
son
Arthur
Plantagenet
lays
most
lawful
claim
To
this
fair
island
and
the

To
Ireland
Poictiers

Desiring
thee
to
lay

these
several
titles
And
put
the

into
young
Arthurs
hand
Thy
nephew
and

What
follows
if
we
disallow
of
this
The
proud
control
of
fierce
and
bloody
war
To
enforce
these
rights
so
forcibly
withheld
Here
have

Then

Bear

Be

An

Farewell
Chatillon
What
now
my
son
Have
I
not
ever
said
How
that
ambitious
Constance
would
not
cease
Till
she
had
kindled
France
and
all
the
world
Upon
the
right
and
party
of
her
son
This
might
have
been
prevented
and
made
whole
With
very
easy
arguments
of
love
Which
now
the
manage
of
two
kingdoms
must
With
fearful
bloody
issue
arbitrate
Our
strong
possession
and
our
right
for
us
Your
strong
possession
much
more
than
your
right
Or
else
it
must
go
wrong
with
you
and
me
So
much
my
conscience
whispers
in
your
ear
Which
none
but
heaven
and
you
and
I
shall
hear
Enter
a
My
liege
here
is
the
strangest
controversy
Come
from
the
country
to
be
judgd
by
you
That
eer
I
heard
Shall
I
produce
the
men
Let
them
approach
Our
abbeys
and
our
priories
shall
pay
This
expeditions
charge
Enter
and
his
bastard
brother
What
men
are
you
Your
faithful
subject
I
a
gentleman
Born
in
Northamptonshire
and
eldest
son
As
I
suppose
to
Robert
Faulconbridge
soldier
by
the
honourgiving
hand
Of
Coeurdelion
knighted
in
the
field
What
art
thou
The
son
and
heir
to
that
same
Faulconbridge
Is
that
the
elder
and
art
thou
the
heir
You
came
not
of
one
mother
then
it
seems
Most
certain
of
one
mother
mighty
king
That
is
well
known
and
as
I
think
one
father
But
for
the
certain
knowledge
of
that
truth
I
put
you
oer
to
heaven
and
to
my
mother
Of
that
I
doubt
as
all
mens
children
may
Out
on
thee
rude
man
Thou
dost
shame
thy
mother
And
wound
her
honour
with
this
diffidence
I
madam
No
I
have
no
reason
for
it
That
is
my
brothers
plea
and
none
of
mine
The
which
if
he
can
prove
a
pops
me
out
At
least
from
fair
five
hundred
pound
a
year
Heaven
guard
my
mothers
honour
and
my
land
good
blunt
fellow
Why
being
younger
born
Doth
he
lay
claim
to
thine
inheritance
I
know
not
why
except
to
get
the
land
But
once
he
slanderd
me
with
bastardy
But
wheer
I
be
as
true
begot
or
no
That
still
I
lay
upon
my
mothers
head
But
that
I
am
as
well
begot
my
liege
Fair
fall
the
bones
that
took
the
pains
for
me
Compare
our
faces
and
be
judge
yourself
If
old
Sir
Robert
did
beget
us
both
And
were
our
father
and
this
son
like
him
old
Sir
Robert
father
on
my
knee
I
give
heaven
thanks
I
was
not
like
to
thee
Why
what
a
madcap
hath
heaven
lent
us
here
He
hath
a
trick
of
Coeurdelions
face
The
accent
of
his
tongue
affecteth
him
Do
you
not
read
some
tokens
of
my
son
In
the
large
composition
of
this
man
Mine
eye
hath
well
examined
his
parts
And
finds
them
perfect
Richard
Sirrah
speak
What
doth
move
you
to
claim
your
brothers
land
Because
he
hath
a
halfface
like
my
father
With
half
that
face
would
he
have
all
my
land
halffacd
groat
five
hundred
pound
a
year
My
gracious
liege
when
that
my
father
livd
Your
brother
did
employ
my
father
much
Well
sir
by
this
you
cannot
get
my
land
Your
tale
must
be
how
he
employd
my
mother
And
once
dispatchd
him
in
an
embassy
To
Germany
there
with
the
Emperor
To
treat
of
high
affairs
touching
that
time
Th
advantage
of
his
absence
took
the
King
And
in
the
meantime
sojournd
at
my
fathers
Where
how
he
did
prevail
I
shame
to
speak
But
truth
is
truth
large
lengths
of
seas
and
shores
Between
my
father
and
my
mother
lay
As
I
have
heard
my
father
speak
himself
When
this
same
lusty
gentleman
was
got
Upon
his
deathbed
he
by
will
bequeathd
His
lands
to
me
and
took
it
on
his
death
That
this
my
mothers
son
was
none
of
his
And
if
he
were
he
came
into
the
world
Full
fourteen
weeks
before
the
course
of
time
Then
good
my
liege
let
me
have
what
is
mine
My
fathers
land
as
was
my
fathers
will
Sirrah
your
brother
is
legitimate
Your
fathers
wife
did
after
wedlock
bear
him
And
if
she
did
play
false
the
fault
was
hers
Which
fault
lies
on
the
hazards
of
all
husbands
That
marry
wives
Tell
me
how
if
my
brother
Who
as
you
say
took
pains
to
get
this
son
Had
of
your
father
claimd
this
son
for
his
In
sooth
good
friend
your
father
might
have
kept
This
calf
bred
from
his
cow
from
all
the
world
In
sooth
he
might
then
if
he
were
my
brothers
My
brother
might
not
claim
him
nor
your
father
Being
none
of
his
refuse
him
This
concludes
My
mothers
son
did
get
your
fathers
heir
Your
fathers
heir
must
have
your
fathers
land
Shall
then
my
fathers
will
be
of
no
force
To
dispossess
that
child
which
is
not
his
Of
no
more
force
to
dispossess
me
sir
Than
was
his
will
to
get
me
as
I
think
Whether
hadst
thou
rather
be
a
Faulconbridge
And
like
thy
brother
to
enjoy
thy
land
Or
the
reputed
son
of
Coeurdelion
Lord
of
thy
presence
and
no
land
beside
Madam
an
if
my
brother
had
my
shape
And
I
had
his
Sir
Roberts
his
like
him
And
if
my
legs
were
two
such
ridingrods
My
arms
such
eelskins
stuffd
my
face
so
thin
That
in
mine
ear
I
durst
not
stick
a
rose
Lest
men
should
say
Look
where
threefarthings
goes
And
to
his
shape
were
heir
to
all
this
land
Would
I
might
never
stir
from
off
this
place
I
would
give
it
every
foot
to
have
this
face
I
would
not
be
Sir
Nob
in
any
case
I
like
thee
well
Wilt
thou
forsake
thy
fortune
Bequeath
thy
land
to
him
and
follow
me
I
am
a
soldier
and
now
bound
to
France
Brother
take
you

land
Ill
take
my
chance
Your
face
hath
got
five
hundred
pound
a
year
Yet
sell
your
face
for
fivepence
and
tis
dear
Madam
Ill
follow
you
unto
the
death
Nay
I
would
have
you
go
before
me
thither
Our
country

our
betters

What
is

From

Kneel

Now

When

I

call

so
Madam
by

Something
about
a
little
from

In
at
the
window
or
else
oer
the
hatch
Who
dares
not

by

And

Near

And

Go

now
hast
thou
thy

landless
knight
makes
thee
a
landed
squire
Come
madam
and
come
Richard
we
must
speed
For
France
for
France
for
it
is
more
than

Brother
adieu
Good
fortune
come
to
thee
For
thou
wast
got
i
th
way
of
honesty
foot
of

better
than
I
was
But
many
a
many
foot
of

the
worse
Well
now
can
I
make
any
Joan
a
lady
Good
den
Sir
RichardGodamercy
fellow
And
if
his
name
be
George
Ill
call
him
Peter
For
newmade
honour
doth
forget
mens
names
Tis
too
respective
and
too
sociable
For
your
conversion
Now
your
traveller
He
and
his
toothpick
at
my
worships
mess
And
when
my
knightly
stomach
is
sufficd
Why
then
I
suck
my
teeth
and
catechize
My
picked
man
of
countries
My
dear
sir
Thus
leaning
on
mine
elbow
I
begin
I
shall
beseech
youThat
is
question
now
And
then
comes
answer
like
an
Absey
book
sir
says
answer
at
your
best
command
At
your
employment
at
your
service
sir
No
sir
says
question
I
sweet
sir
at
yours
And
so
ere
answer
knows
what
question
would
Saving
in
dialogue
of
compliment
And
talking
of
the
Alps
and
Apennines
The
Pyrenean
and
the
river
Po
It
draws
toward
supper
in
conclusion
so
But
this
is
worshipful
society
And
fits
the
mounting
spirit
like
myself
For
he
is
but
a
bastard
to
the
time
That
doth
not
smack
of
observation
And
so
am
I
whether
I
smack
or
no
And
not
alone
in
habit
and
device
Exterior
form
outward
accoutrement
But
from
the
inward
motion
to
deliver
Sweet
sweet
sweet
poison
for
the
ages
tooth
Which
though
I
will
not
practise
to
deceive
Yet
to
avoid
deceit
I
mean
to
learn
For
it
shall
strew
the
footsteps
of
my
rising
But
who
comes
in
such
haste
in
ridingrobes
What
womanpost
is
this
Hath
she
no
husband
That
will
take
pains
to
blow
a
horn
before
her
Enter

my

How
now
good

What
brings
you
here
to
court
so
hastily
Where
is
that
slave
thy

Where
is
he
That
holds
in

mine
honour
up
and
down
My

Robert
old
Sir

Colbrand
the

that

Is

Ill
tell

Madam
I
was
not
old
Sir
Roberts
son
Sir
Robert
might
have
eat
his
part
in
me
Upon
Good
Friday
and
neer
broke
his
fast
Sir
Robert
could
do
wellmarry
to
confess
Could
he
get
me
Sir
Robert
could
not
do
it
We
know
his
handiwork
Therefore
good
mother
To
whom
am
I
beholding
for
these
limbs
Sir
Robert
never
holp
to
make
this
leg
Hast
thou
conspired
with
thy
brother
too
That
for
thine
own
gain
shouldst
defend
mine
honour
What
means
this
scorn
thou
most
untoward
knave
Knight
knight
good
mother
Basiliscolike
What
I
am
dubbd
I
have
it
on
my
shoulder
But
mother
I
am
not
Sir
Roberts
son
I
have
disclaimd
Sir
Robert
and
my
land
Legitimation
name
and
all
is
gone
Then
good
my
mother
let
me
know
my
father
Some
proper
man
I
hope
Who
was
it
mother
Hast
thou
denied
thyself
a
Faulconbridge
As
faithfully
as
I
deny
the
devil
King
Richard
Coeurdelion
was
thy
father
By
long
and
vehement
suit
I
was
seducd
To
make
room
for
him
in
my
husbands
bed
Heaven
lay
not
my
transgression
to
my
charge
Thou
art
the
issue
of
my
dear
offence
Which
was
so
strongly
urgd
past
my
defence
Now
by
this
light
were
I
to
get
again
Madam
I
would
not
wish
a
better
father
Some
sins
do
bear
their
privilege
on
earth
And
so
doth
yours
your
fault
was
not
your
folly
Needs
must
you
lay
your
heart
at
his
dispose
Subjected
tribute
to
commanding
love
Against
whose
fury
and
unmatched
force
The
aweless
lion
could
not
wage
the
fight
Nor
keep
his
princely
heart
from
Richards
hand
He
that
perforce
robs
lions
of
their
hearts
May
easily
win
a
womans
Ay
my
mother
With
all
my
heart
I
thank
thee
for
my
father
Who
lives
and
dares
but
say
thou
didst
not
well
When
I
was
got
Ill
send
his
soul
to
hell
Come
lady
I
will
show
thee
to
my
kin
And
they
shall
say
when
Richard
me
begot
If
thou
hadst
said
him
nay
it
had
been
sin
Who
says
it
was
he
lies
I
say
twas
not
France
Before
Angiers
Enter
on
one
side
and
forces
on
the
other
the
Dauphin
and

Before

well
met
brave
Austria
Arthur
that
great
forerunner
of
thy
blood
Richard
that
robbd
the
lion
of
his
heart
And
fought
the
holy
wars
in
Palestine
By
this
brave
duke
came
early
to
his
grave
And
for

At
our
importance
hither
is
he
come
To
spread
his
colours
boy
in
thy
behalf
And
to
rebuke
the
usurpation
Of
thy
unnatural
uncle
English
John
Embrace
him
love
him
give
him
welcome
hither
God
shall
forgive
you
Coeurdelions
death
The
rather
that
you
give
his
offspring
life
Shadowing
their
right
under
your
wings
of
war
I
give
you
welcome
with
a
powerless
hand
But
with
a
heart
full
of
unstained
love
Welcome
before
the
gates
of
Angiers
Duke
noble
boy
Who
would
not
do
thee
right
Upon
thy
cheek
lay
I
this
zealous
kiss
As
seal
to
this
indenture
of
my
love
That
to
my
home
I
will
no
more
return
Till
Angiers
and
the
right
thou
hast
in
France
Together
with
that
pale
that
whitefacd
shore
Whose
foot
spurns
back
the
oceans
roaring
tides
And
coops
from
other
lands
her
islanders
Even
till
that
England
hedgd
in
with
the
main
That
waterwalled
bulwark
still
secure
And
confident
from
foreign
purposes
Even
till
that
utmost
corner
of
the
west
Salute
thee
for
her
king
Till
then
fair
boy
Will
I
not
think
of
home
but
follow
arms
take
his
mothers
thanks
a
widows
thanks
Till
your
strong
hand
shall
help
to
give
him
strength
To
make
a
more
requital
to
your
love
The
peace
of
heaven
is
theirs
that
lift
their
swords
In
such
a
just
and
charitable
war
Well
then
to
work
Our
cannon
shall
be
bent
Against
the
brows
of
this
resisting
town
Call
for
our
chiefest
men
of
discipline
To
cull
the
plots
of
best
advantages
Well
lay
before
this
town
our
royal
bones
Wade
to
the
marketplace
in
Frenchmens
blood
But
we
will
make
it
subject
to
this
boy
Stay
for
an
answer
to
your
embassy
Lest
unadvisd
you
stain
your
swords
with
blood
My
Lord
Chatillon
may
from
England
bring
That
right
in
peace
which
here
we
urge
in
war
And
then
we
shall
repent
each
drop
of
blood
That
hot
rash
haste
so
indirectly
shed
Enter
wonder
lady
Lo
upon
thy
wish
Our
messenger
Chatillon
is
arrivd
What
England
says
say
briefly
gentle
lord
We
coldly
pause
for
thee
Chatillon
speak
Then
turn
your
forces
from
this
paltry
siege
And
stir
them
up
against
a
mightier
task
England
impatient
of
your
just
demands
Hath
put
himself
in
arms
The
adverse
winds
Whose
leisure
I
have
stayd
have
given
him
time
To
land
his
legions
all
as
soon
as
I
His
marches
are
expedient
to
this
town
His
forces
strong
his
soldiers
confident
With
him
along
is
come
the
motherqueen
An
Ate
stirring
him
to
blood
and
strife
With
her
the
Lady
Blanch
of
Spain
With
them
a
bastard
of
the
kings
deceasd
And
all
th
unsettled
humours
of
the
land
Rash
inconsiderate
fiery
voluntaries
With
ladies
faces
and
fierce
dragons
spleens
Have
sold
their
fortunes
at
their
native
homes
Bearing
their
birthrights
proudly
on
their
backs
To
make
a
hazard
of
new
fortunes
here
In
brief
a
braver
choice
of
dauntless
spirits
Than
now
the
English
bottoms
have
waft
oer
Did
never
float
upon
the
swelling
tide
To
do
offence
and
scathe
in
Christendom
Drum
beats
The
interruption
of
their
churlish
drums
Cuts
off
more
circumstance
they
are
at
hand
To
parley
or
to
fight
therefore
prepare
How
much
unlookd
for
is
this
expedition
By
how
much
unexpected
by
so
much
We
must
awake
endeavour
for
defence
For
courage
mounteth
with
occasion
Let
them
be
welcome
then
we
are
prepard
Enter
the
and
others
Peace
be
to
France
if
France
in
peace
permit
Our
just
and
lineal
entrance
to
our
own
If
not
bleed
France
and
peace
ascend
to
heaven
Whiles
we
Gods
wrathful
agent
do
correct
Their
proud
contempt
that
beats
His
peace
to
heaven
Peace
be
to
England
if
that
war
return
From
France
to
England
there
to
live
in
peace
England
we
love
and
for
that
Englands
sake
With
burden
of
our
armour
here
we
sweat
This
toil
of
ours
should
be
a
work
of
thine
But
thou
from
loving
England
art
so
far
That
thou
hast
underwrought
his
lawful
king
Cut
off
the
sequence
of
posterity
Outfaced
infant
state
and
done
a
rape
Upon
the
maiden
virtue
of
the
crown
Look
here
upon
thy
brother
Geffreys
face
These
eyes
these
brows
were
moulded
out
of
his
This
little
abstract
doth
contain
that
large
Which
died
in
Geffrey
and
the
hand
of
time
Shall
draw
this
brief
into
as
huge
a
volume
That
Geffrey
was
thy
elder
brother
born
And
this
his
son
England
was
Geffreys
right
And
this
is
Geffreys
In
the
name
of
God
How
comes
it
then
that
thou
art
calld
a
king
When
living
blood
doth
in
these
temples
beat
Which
owe
the
crown
that
thou
oermasterest
From
whom
hast
thou
this
great
commission
France
To
draw
my
answer
from
thy
articles
From
that
supernal
judge
that
stirs
good
thoughts
In
any
breast
of
strong
authority
To
look
into
the
blots
and
stains
of
right
That
judge
hath
made
me
guardian
to
this
boy
Under
whose
warrant
I
impeach
thy
wrong
And
by
whose
help
I
mean
to
chastise
it
Alack
thou
dost
usurp
authority
Excuse
it
is
to
beat

down
Who
is
it
thou
dost
call
usurper
France
Let
me
make
answer
thy
usurping
son
Out
insolent
Thy
bastard
shall
be
king
That
thou
mayst
be
a
queen
and
check
the
world
My

thy
son
as
true
As
thine
was
to
thy
husband
and

Liker

As

By

It

beseems
this

to

To
these

repetitions
Some
trumpet
summon
hither
to
the
walls
These
men
of
Angiers
let
us
hear
them
speak
Whose
title
they
admit
Arthurs
or
Johns
Trumpet

Enter
citizens
upon
the
walls
Who
is
it
that
hath
warnd
us
to
the
walls
Tis
France
for
England
England
for
itself
You
men
of
Angiers
and
my
loving
subjects
You
loving
men
of
Angiers
Arthurs
subjects
Our
trumpet
calld
you
to
this
gentle
parle
For
our
advantage
therefore
hear
us
first
These
flags
of
France
that
are
advanced
here
Before
the
eye
and
prospect
of
your
town
Have
hither
marchd
to
your
endamagement
The
cannons
have
their
bowels
full
of
wrath
And
ready
mounted
are
they
to
spit
forth
Their
iron
indignation
gainst
your
walls
All
preparation
for
a
bloody
siege
And
merciless
proceeding
by
these
French
Confront
your
citys
eyes
your
winking
gates
And
but
for
our
approach
those
sleeping
stones
That
as
a
waist
doth
girdle
you
about
By
the
compulsion
of
their
ordinance
By
this
time
from
their
fixed
beds
of
lime
Had
been
dishabited
and
wide
havoc
made
For
bloody
power
to
rush
upon
your
peace
But
on
the
sight
of
us
your
lawful
king
Who
painfully
with
much
expedient
march
Have
brought
a
countercheck
before
your
gates
To
save
unscratchd
your
citys
threatned
cheeks
Behold
the
French
amazd
vouchsafe
a
parle
And
now
instead
of
bullets
wrappd
in
fire
To
make
a
shaking
fever
in
your
walls
They
shoot
but
calm
words
folded
up
in
smoke
To
make
a
faithless
error
in
your
cars
Which
trust
accordingly
kind
citizens
And
let
us
inyour
King
whose
labourd
spirits
Forwearied
in
this
action
of
swift
speed
Craves
harbourage
within
your
city
walls
When
I
have
said
make
answer
to
us
both
Lo
in
this
right
hand
whose
protection
Is
most
divinely
vowd
upon
the
right
Of
him
it
holds
stands
young
Plantagenet
Son
to
the
elder
brother
of
this
man
And
king
oer
him
and
all
that
he
enjoys
For
this
downtrodden
equity
we
tread
In
warlike
march
these
greens
before
your
town
Being
no
further
enemy
to
you
Than
the
constraint
of
hospitable
zeal
In
the
relief
of
this
oppressed
child
Religiously
provokes
Be
pleased
then
To
pay
that
duty
which
you
truly
owe
To
him
that
owes
it
namely
this
young
prince
And
then
our
arms
like
to
a
muzzled
bear
Save
in
aspect
hath
all
offence
seald
up
Our
cannons
malice
vainly
shall
be
spent
Against
th
invulnerable
clouds
of
heaven
And
with
a
blessed
and
unvexd
retire
With
unhackd
swords
and
helmets
all
unbruisd
We
will
bear
home
that
lusty
blood
again
Which
here
we
came
to
spout
against
your
town
And
leave
your
children
wives
and
you
in
peace
But
if
you
fondly
pass
our
profferd
offer
Tis
not
the
roundure
of
your
oldfacd
walls
Can
hide
you
from
our
messengers
of
war
Though
all
these
English
and
their
discipline
Were
harbourd
in
their
rude
circumference
Then
tell
us
shall
your
city
call
us
lord
In
that
behalf
which
we
have
challengd
it
Or
shall
we
give
the
signal
to
our
rage
And
stalk
in
blood
to
our
possession
In
brief
we
are
the
King
of
Englands
subjects
For
him
and
in
his
right
we
hold
this
town
Acknowledge
then
the
King
and
let
me
in
That
can
we
not
but
he
that
proves
the
King
To
him
will
we
prove
loyal
Till
that
time
Have
we
rammd
up
our
gates
against
the
world
Doth
not
the
crown
of
England
prove
the
King
And
if
not
that
I
bring
you
witnesses
Twice
fifteen
thousand
hearts
of
Englands
breed
Bastards
and
else
To
verify
our
title
with
their
lives
As
many
and
as
wellborn
bloods
as
those
Some
bastards
too
Stand
in
his
face
to
contradict
his
claim
Till
you
compound
whose
right
is
worthiest
We
for
the
worthiest
hold
the
right
from
both
Then
God
forgive
the
sin
of
all
those
souls
That
to
their
everlasting
residence
Before
the
dew
of
evening
fall
shall
fleet
In
dreadful
trial
of

Up

And

Who

hand
of

this
day
hath
made
Much
work
for
tears
in
many
an
English
mother
Whose
sons
lie
scattered
on
the
bleeding
ground
Many
a
widows
husband
grovelling
lies
Coldly
embracing
the
discoloured
earth
And
victory
with
little
loss
doth
play
Upon
the
dancing
banners
of
the
French
Who
are
at
hand
triumphantly
displayed
To
enter
conquerors
and
to
proclaim
Arthur

Britaine
Englands
King
and
yours
Enter
with

Rejoice
you
men
of
Angiers
ring
your
bells
King
John
your
king
and
Englands
doth
approach
Commander
of
this
hot
malicious
day
Their
armours
that
marchd
hence
so
silverbright
Hither
return
all
gilt
with
Frenchmens
blood
There
stuck
no
plume
in
any
English
crest
That
is
removed
by
a
staff
of
France
Our
colours
do
return
in
those
same
hands
That
did
display
them
when
we
first
marchd
forth
And
like
a
jolly
troop
of
huntsmen
come
Our
lusty
English
all
with
purpled
hands
Dyd
in
the
dying
slaughter
of
their
foes
Open
your
gates
and
give
the
victors
way
Heralds
from
off
our
towrs
we
might
behold
From
first
to
last
the
onset
and
retire
Of
both
your
armies
whose
equality
By
our
best
eyes
cannot
be
censured
Blood
hath
bought
blood
and
blows
have
answerd
blows
Strength
matchd
with
strength
and
power
confronted
power
Both
are
alike
and
both
alike
we
like
One
must
prove
greatest
While
they
weigh
so
even
We
hold
our
town
for
neither
yet
for
both
Enter
the
two
with
their
powers
at
several
doors
France
hast
thou
yet
more
blood
to
cast
away
Say
shall
the
current
of
our
right
run
on
Whose
passage
vexd
with
thy
impediment
Shall
leave
his
native
channel
and
oerswell
With
course
disturbd
even
thy
confining
shores
Unless
thou
let
his
silver
water
keep
peaceful
progress
to
the
ocean
England
thou
hast
not
savd
one
drop
of
blood
In
this
hot
trial
more
than
we
of
France
Rather
lost
more
And
by
this
hand
I
swear
That
sways
the
earth
this
climate
overlooks
Before
we
will
lay
down
our

Well
put
thee
down
gainst
whom
these
arms
we
bear
Or
add
a
royal
number
to
the
dead
Gracing
the
scroll
that
tells
of
this
wars
loss
With
slaughter
coupled
to
the
name
of
kings
Ha
majesty
how
high
thy
glory
towrs
When
the
rich
blood
of
kings
is
set
on
fire
now
doth
Death
line
his
dead
chaps
with
steel
The
swords
of
soldiers
are
his
teeth
his
fangs
And
now
he
feasts
mousing
the
flesh
of
men
In
undetermind
differences
of
kings
Why
stand
these
royal
fronts
amazed
thus
Cry
havoc
kings
back
to
the
stained
field
You
equal
potents
fiery
kindled
spirits
Then
let
confusion
of
one
part
confirm
The
others
peace
Till
then
blows
blood
and
death
Whose
party
do
the
townsmen
yet
admit
Speak
citizens
for
England
whos
your
king
The
King
of
England
when
we
know
the
King
Know
him
in
us
that
here
hold
up
his
right
In
us
that
are
our
own
great
deputy
And
bear
possession
of
our
person
here
Lord
of
our
presence
Angiers
and
of
you
greater
powr
than
we
denies
all
this
And
till
it
be
undoubted
we
do
lock
Our
former
scruple
in
our
strongbarrd
gates
Kingd
of
our
fears
until
our
fears
resolvd
Be
by
some
certain
king
purgd
and
deposd
By
heaven
these
scroyles
of
Angiers
flout
you
kings
And
stand
securely
on
their
battlements
As
in
a
theatre
whence
they
gape
and
point
At
your
industrious
scenes
and
acts
of
death
Your
royal
presences
be
ruld
by
me
Do
like
the
mutines
of
Jerusalem
Be
friends
awhile
and
both
conjointly
bend
Your
sharpest
deeds
of
malice
on
this
town
By
east
and
west
let
France
and
England
mount
Their
battering
cannon
charged
to
the
mouths
Till
their
soulfearing
clamours
have
brawld
down
The
flinty
ribs
of
this
contemptuous
city
Id
play
incessantly
upon
these
jades
Even
till
unfenced
desolation
Leave
them
as
naked
as
the
vulgar
air
That
done
dissever
your
united
strengths
And
part
your
mingled
colours
once
again
Turn
face
to
face
and
bloody
point
to
point
Then
in
a
moment
Fortune
shall
cull
forth
Out
of
one
side
her
happy
minion
To
whom
in
favour
she
shall
give
the
day
And
kiss
him
with
a
glorious
victory
How
like
you
this
wild
counsel
mighty
states
Smacks
it
not
something
of
the
policy
Now
by
the
sky
that
hangs
above
our
heads
I
like
it
well
France
shall
we
knit
our
powrs
And
lay
this
Angiers
even
with
the
ground
Then
after
fight
who
shall
be
king
of
it
An
if
thou
hast
the
mettle
of
a
king
Being
wrongd
as
we
are
by
this
peevish
town
Turn
thou
the
mouth
of
thy
artillery
As
we
will
ours
against
these
saucy
walls
And
when
that
we
have
dashd
them
to
the
ground
Why
then
defy
each
other
and
pellmell
Make
work
upon
ourselves
for
heaven
or
hell
Let
it
be
so
Say
where
will
you
assault
We
from
the
west
will
send
destruction
Into
this
citys
bosom
I
from
the
north
Our
thunder
from
the
south
Shall
rain
their
drift
of
bullets
on
this
town
Aside
prudent
discipline
From
north
to
south
Austria
and
France
shoot
in
each
others
mouth
Ill
stir
them
to
itCome
away
away
Hear
us
great
kings
vouchsafe
awhile
to
stay
And
I
shall
show
you
peace
and
fairfacd
league
Win
you
this
city
without
stroke
or
wound
Rescue
those
breathing
lives
to
die
in
beds
That
here
come
sacrifices
for
the
field
Persever
not
but
hear
me
mighty
kings
Speak
on
with
favour
we
are
bent
to
hear
That
daughter
there
of
Spain
the
Lady
Blanch
Is
niece
to
England
look
upon
the
years
Of
Lewis
the
Dauphin
and
that
lovely
maid
If
lusty
love
should
go
in
quest
of
beauty
Where
should
he
find
it
fairer
than
in
Blanch
If
zealous
love
should
go
in
search
of
virtue
Where
should
he
find
it
purer
than
in
Blanch
If
love
ambitious
sought
a
match
of
birth
Whose
veins
bound
richer
blood
than
Lady
Blanch
Such
as
she
is
in
beauty
virtue
birth
Is
the
young
Dauphin
every
way
complete
If
not
complete
of
say
he
is
not
she
And
she
again
wants
nothing
to
name
want
If
want
it
be
not
that
she
is
not
he
He
is
the
half
part
of
a
blessed
man
Left
to
be
finished
by
such
as
she
And
she
a
fair
divided
excellence
Whose
fulness
of
perfection
lies
in
him
two
such
silver
currents
when
they
join
Do
glorify
the
banks
that
bound
them
in
And
two
such
shores
to
two
such
streams
made
one
Two
such
controlling
bounds
shall
you
be
Kings
To
these
two
princes
if
you
marry
them
This
union
shall
do
more
than
battery
can
To
our
fastclosed
gates
for
at
this
match
With
swifter
spleen
than
powder
can
enforce
The
mouth
of
passage
shall
we
fling
wide
ope
And
give
you
entrance
but
without
this
match
The
sea
enraged
is
not
half
so
deaf
Lions
more
confident
mountains
and
rocks
More
free
from
motionno
not
Death
himself
In
mortal
fury
half
so
peremptory
As
we
to
keep
this
city
Heres
a
stay
That
shakes
the
rotten
carcass
of
old
Death
Out
of
his
rags
Heres
a
large
mouth
indeed
That
spits
forth
death
and
mountains
rocks
and
seas
Talks
as
familiarly
of
roaring
lions
As
maids
of
thirteen
do
of
puppydogs
What
cannoneer
begot
this
lusty
blood
He
speaks
plain
cannonfire
and
smoke
and
bounce
He
gives
the
bastinado
with
his
tongue
Our
ears
are
cudgelld
not
a
word
of
his
But
buffets
better
than
a
fist
of
France
Zounds
I
was
never
so
bethumpd
with
words
Since
I
first
calld
my
brothers
father
dad
Son
list
to
this
conjunction
make
this
match
Give
with
our
niece
a
dowry
large
enough
For
by
this
knot
thou
shalt
so
surely
tie
Thy
now
unsurd
assurance
to
the
crown
That
yon
green
boy
shall
have
no
sun
to
ripe
The
bloom
that
promiseth
a
mighty
fruit
I
see
a
yielding
in
the
looks
of
France
Mark
how
they
whisper
Urge
them
while
their
souls
Are
capable
of
this
ambition
Lest
zeal
now
melted
by
the
windy
breath
Of
soft
petitions
pity
and
remorse
Cool
and
congeal
again
to
what
it
was
Why
answer
not
the
double
majesties
This
friendly
treaty
of
our
threatned
town
Speak
England
first
that
hath
been
forward
first
To
speak
unto
this
city
what
say
you
If
that
the
Dauphin
there
thy
princely
son
Can
in
this
book
of
beauty
read
I
love
Her
dowry
shall
weigh
equal
with
a
queen
For
Anjou
and
fair
Touraine
Maine
Poictiers
And
all
that
we
upon
this
side
the
sea
Except
this
city
now
by
us
besiegd
Find
liable
to
our
crown
and
dignity
Shall
gild
her
bridal
bed
and
make
her
rich
In
titles
honours
and
promotions
As
she
in
beauty
education
blood
Holds
hand
with
any
princess
of
the
world
What
sayst
thou
boy
Look
in
the
ladys
face
I
do
my
lord
and
in
her
eye
I
find
wonder
or
a
wondrous
miracle
The
shadow
of
myself
formd
in
her
eye
Which
being
but
the
shadow
of
your
son
Becomes
a
sun
and
makes
your
son
a
shadow
I
do
protest
I
never
lovd
myself
Till
now
infixed
I
beheld
myself
Drawn
in
the
flattering
table
of
her
eye
Whispers
with
Aside
Drawn
in
the
flattering
table
of
her
eye
Hangd
in
the
frowning
wrinkle
of
her
brow
And
quarterd
in
her
hearthe
doth
espy
Himself
loves
traitor
This
is
pity
now
That
hangd
and
drawn
and
quarterd
there
should
be
In
such
a
love
so
vile
a
lout
as
he
My
uncles
will
in
this
respect
is
mine
If
he
see
aught
in
you
that
makes
him
like
That
anything
he
sees
which
moves
his
liking
I
can
with
ease
translate
it
to
my
will
Or
if
you
will
to
speak
more
properly
I
will
enforce
it
easly
to
my
love
Further
I
will
not
flatter
you
my
lord
That
all
I
see
in
you
is
worthy
love
Than
this
that
nothing
do
I
see
in
you
Though
churlish
thoughts
themselves
should
be
your
judge
That
I
can
find
should
merit
any
hate
What
say
these
young
ones
What
say
you
my
niece
That
she
is
bound
in
honour
still
to
do
What
you
in
wisdom
still
vouchsafe
to
say
Speak
then
Prince
Dauphin
can
you
love
this
lady
Nay
ask
me
if
I
can
refrain
from
love
For
I
do
love
her
most
unfeignedly
Then
do
I
give
Volquessen
Touraine
Maine
Poictiers
and
Anjou
these
five
provinces
With
her
to
thee
and
this
addition
more
Full
thirty
thousand
marks
of
English
coin
Philip
of
France
if
thou
be
pleasd
withal
Command
thy
son
and
daughter
to
join
hands
It
likes
us
well
young
princes
close
your
hands
And
your
lips
too
for
I
am
well
assurd
That
I
did
so
when
I
was
first
assurd
Now
citizens
of
Angiers
ope
your
gates
Let
in
that
amity
which
you
have
made
For
at
Saint
Marys
chapel
presently
The
rites
of
marriage
shall
be
solemnizd
Is
not
the
Lady
Constance
in
this
troop
I
know
she
is
not
for
this
match
made
up
Her
presence
would
have
interrupted
much
Where
is
she
and
her
son
Tell
me
who
knows
She
is
sad
and
passionate
at
your
Highness
tent
And
by
my
faith
this
league
that
we
have
made
Will
give
her
sadness
very
little
cure
Brother
of
England
how
may
we
content
This
widow
lady
In
her
right
we
came
Which
we
God
knows
have
turnd
another
way
To
our
own
vantage
We
will
heal
up
all
For
well
create
young
Arthur
Duke
of
Britaine
And
Earl
of
Richmond
and
this
rich
fair
town
We
make
him
lord
of
Call
the
Lady
Constance
Some
speedy
messenger
bid
her
repair
To
our
solemnity
I
trust
we
shall
If
not
fill
up
the
measure
of
her
will
Yet
in
some
measure
satisfy
her
so
That
we
shall
stop
her
exclamation
Go
we
as
well
as
haste
will
suffer
us
To
this
unlookdfor
unprepared
pomp
Mad
world
mad

mad
composition
John
to
stop
Arthurs
tide
in
the

Hath
willingly
departed
with

And
France
whose
armour

buckled
on
Whom
zeal
and
charity
brought
to
the
field
As
Gods
own
soldier
rounded
in
the
ear
With
that
same
purposechanger
that
sly
devil
That
broker
that
still
breaks
the
pate
of

That
daily

Of

of

Who
having

But
the

cheats
the
poor
maid
of
that
That
smoothfacd

tickling
commodity
Commodity
the
bias
of
the
world
The
world
who
of
itself
is
peised
well
Made
to
run
even
upon
even
ground
Till
this
advantage
this
viledrawing
bias
This
sway
of
motion
this
commodity
Makes
it
take
head
from
all
indifferency
From
all
direction

And
this

bias
this
commodity
This
bawd
this
broker
this
allchanging
word
Clappd
on
the
outward
eye
of
fickle
France
Hath
drawn
him
from
his
own
determind
aid
From
a
resolvd
and
honourable
war
To
a
most
base
and
vileconcluded
peace
And
why
rail
I
on
this
commodity
But
for
because
he
hath
not
wood
me
yet
Not
that
I
have
the
power
to
clutch
my
hand
When
his
fair
angels
would
salute
my
palm
But
for
my
hand
as
unattempted
yet
Like
a
poor
beggar
raileth
on

Well
whiles
I
am
a
beggar
I
will
rail
And
say
there
is
no
sin
but
to
be
rich
And
being
rich
my
virtue
then
shall
be
To
say
there
is
no
vice
but
beggary
Since

break
faith
upon

It

Be

It

so
I

I
may
not
trust
thee
for
thy

breath
of
a
common

Believe
me
I
do
not
believe
thee
man
I
have
a
kings
oath
to
the
contrary
Thou
shalt
be
punishd
for
thus
frighting
me
For
I
am
sick
and
capable
of
fears
Oppressd
with
wrongs
and
therefore
full
of
fears
widow
husbandless
subject
to

And
though
thou
now
confess
thou
didst
but
jest
With
my

spirits
I
cannot
take
a
truce
But
they
will
quake
and
tremble
all
this
day
What
dost
thou
mean
by
shaking
of
thy
head
Why
dost
thou
look
so
sadly
on
my
son
What
means
that
hand
upon
that
breast
of
thine
Why
holds
thine
eye
that
lamentable
rheum
Like
a
proud
river
peering
oer
his
bounds
Be
these
sad
signs
confirmers
of
thy

Then

all
thy
former

But
this
one
word
whether
thy
tale
be
true
As
true
as
I
believe
you
think
them
false
That
give
you
cause
to
prove
my
saying
true
if
thou
teach
me
to
believe
this
sorrow
Teach
thou
this
sorrow
how
to
make
me
die
And
let
belief
and
life
encounter
so
As
doth
the
fury
of
two
desperate
men
Which
in
the
very
meeting
fall
and
die

what
becomes
of
me
Fellow
be
gone
I
cannot
brook
thy
sight
This
news
hath
made
thee
a
most
ugly
man
What
other
harm
have
I
good
lady
done
But
spoke
the
harm
that
is
by
others
done
Which
harm
within
itself
so
heinous
is
As
it
makes
harmful
all
that
speak
of
it
I
do
beseech
you
madam
be
content
If
thou
that
bidst
me
be
content
wert
grim
Ugly
and
slandrous
to
thy
mothers
womb
Full
of
unpleasing
blots
and
sightless
stains
Lame
foolish
crooked
swart
prodigious
Patchd
with
foul
moles
and
eyeoffending
marks
I
would
not
care
I
then
would
be
content
For
then
I
should
not
love
thee
no
nor
thou
Become
thy
great
birth
nor
deserve
a
crown
But
thou
art
fair
and
at
thy
birth
dear
boy
Nature
and
Fortune
joind
to
make
thee
great
Of
Natures
gifts
thou
mayst
with
lilies
boast
And
with
the
halfblown
rose
but
Fortune
She
is
corrupted
changd
and
won
from
thee
Sh
adulterates
hourly
with
thine
uncle
John
And
with
her
golden
hand
hath
pluckd
on
France
To
tread
down
fair
respect
of
sovereignty
And
made
his
majesty
the
bawd
to
theirs
France
is
a
bawd
to
Fortune
and
King
John
That
strumpet
Fortune
that
usurping
John
Tell
me
thou
fellow
is
not
France
forsworn
Envenom
him
with
words
or
get
thee
gone
And
leave
those
woes
alone
which
I
alone
Am
bound
to
underbear
Pardon
me
madam
I
may
not
go
without
you
to
the
kings
Thou
mayst
thou
shalt
I
will
not
go
with
thee
I
will
instruct
my
sorrows
to
be
proud
For
grief
is
proud
and
makes
his
owner
stoop
To
me
and
to
the
state
of
my
great
grief
Let
kings
assemble
for
my
griefs
so
great
That
no
supporter
but
the
huge
firm
earth
Can
hold
it
up
Seats
herself
on
the
ground
Here
I
and
sorrows
sit
Here
is
my
throne
bid
kings
come
bow
to
it
Enter
the
and
attendants
Tis
true
fair
daughter
and
this
blessed
day
Ever
in
France
shall
be
kept
festival
To
solemnize
this
day
the
glorious
sun
Stays
in
his
course
and
plays
the
alchemist
Turning
with
splendour
of
his
precious
eye
The
meagre
cloddy
earth
to
glittering
gold
The
yearly
course
that
brings
this
day
about
Shall
never
see
it
but
a
holiday
Rising
wicked
day
and
not
a
holy
day
What
hath
this
day
deservd
what
hath
it
done
That
it
in
golden
letters
should
be
set
Among
the
high
tides
in
the
calendar
Nay
rather
turn
this
day
out
of
the
week
This
day
of
shame
oppression
perjury
Or
if
it
must
stand
still
let
wives
with
child
Pray
that
their
burdens
may
not
fall
this
day
Lest
that
their
hopes
prodigiously
be
crossd
But
on
this
day
let
seamen
fear
no
wreck
No
bargains
break
that
are
not
this
day
made
This
day
all
things
begun
come
to
ill
end
Yea
faith
itself
to
hollow
falsehood
change
By
heaven
lady
you
shall
have
no
cause
To
curse
the
fair
proceedings
of
this
day
Have
I
not
pawnd
to
you
my
majesty
You
have
beguild
me
with
a
counterfeit
Resembling
majesty
which
being
touchd
and
tried
Proves
valueless
you
are
forsworn
forsworn
You
came
in
arms
to
spill
mine
enemies
blood
But
now
in
arms
you
strengthen
it
with
yours
The
grappling
vigour
and
rough
frown
of
war
Is
cold
in
amity
and
painted
peace
And
our
oppression
hath
made
up
this
league
Arm

Let
not
the

of

Wear

Peace

Lymoges

thou

That

Thou

thou

thou

Thou
little
valiant
great
in
villainy
Thou
ever
strong
upon
the
stronger
side
Thou
Fortunes
champion
that

never

But
when
her

is
by
To
teach
thee

Thou
art
perjurd
too
And
soothst
up

What
a

art
thou
ramping
fool
to
brag
and

and

Upon

Thou
coldblooded

Hast
thou

on

side
Been

bidding

Upon

And

now
fall
over

my
foes
Thou
wear
a

Doff
it
for
shame
And
hang
a
calfsskin
on
those
recreant
limbs
that
a
man
should
speak
those
words
to
me
And
hang
a
calfsskin
on
those
recreant
limbs
Thou
darst
not

so
villain
for
thy
life
And
hang

on
those
recreant

We
like
not

thou
dost

Enter
Here
comes
the
holy
legate
of
the
Pope
Hail
you
anointed
deputies
of
heaven
To
thee
King
John
my
holy
errand
is
I
Pandulph
of
fair
Milan
cardinal
And
from
Pope
Innocent
the
legate
here
Do
in
his
name
religiously
demand
Why
thou
against
the
Church
our
holy
mother
So
wilfully
dost
spurn
and
force
perforce
Keep
Stephen
Langton
chosen
Archbishop
Of
Canterbury
from
that
holy
see
This
in
our
foresaid
holy
fathers
name
Pope
Innocent
I
do
demand
of
thee
What
earthly
name
to
interrogatories
Can
task
the
free
breath
of
a
sacred
king
Thou
canst
not
Cardinal
devise
a
name
So
slight
unworthy
and
ridiculous
To
charge
me
to
an
answer
as
the
Pope
Tell
him
this
tale
and
from
the
mouth
of
England
Add
thus
much
more
that
no
Italian
priest
Shall
tithe
or
toll
in
our
dominions
But
as
we
under
heaven
are
supreme
head
So
under
Him
that
great
supremacy
Where
we
do
reign
we
will
alone
uphold
Without
th
assistance
of
a
mortal
hand
So
tell
the
Pope
all
reverence
set
apart
To
him
and
his
usurpd
authority
Brother
of
England
you
blaspheme
in
this
Though
you
and
all
the
kings
of
Christendom
Are
led
so
grossly
by
this
meddling
priest
Dreading
the
curse
that
money
may
buy
out
And
by
the
merit
of
vile
gold
dross
dust
Purchase
corrupted
pardon
of
a
man
Who
in
that
sale
sells
pardon
from
himself
Though
you
and
all
the
rest
so
grossly
led
This
juggling
witchcraft
with
revenue
cherish
Yet
I
alone
alone
do
me
oppose
Against
the
Pope
and
count
his
friends
my
foes
Then
by
the
lawful
power
that
I
have
Thou
shalt
stand
cursd
and
excommunicate
And
blessed
shall
he
be
that
doth
revolt
From
his
allegiance
to
an
heretic
And
meritorious
shall
that
hand
be
calld
Canonized
and
worshippd
as
a
saint
That
takes
away
by
any
secret
course
Thy
hateful
life
lawful
let
it
be
That
I
have
room
with
Rome
to
curse
awhile
Good
father
Cardinal
cry
thou
amen
To
my
keen
curses
for
without
my
wrong
There
is
no
tongue
hath
power
to
curse
him
right
Theres
law
and
warrant
lady
for
my
curse
And
for
mine
too
when
law
can
do
no
right
Let
it
be
lawful
that
law
bar
no
wrong
Law
cannot
give
my
child
his
kingdom
here
For
he
that
holds
his
kingdom
holds
the
law
Therefore
since
law
itself
is
perfect
wrong
How
can
the
law
forbid
my
tongue
to
curse
Philip
of
France
on
peril
of
a
curse
Let
go
the
hand
of
that
archheretic
And
raise
the
power
of
France
upon
his
head
Unless
he
do
submit
himself
to
Rome
Lookst
thou
pale
France
Do
not
let
go
thy
hand
Look
to
that
devil
lest
that
France
repent
And
by
disjoining
hands
hell
lose
a
soul
King
Philip
listen
to
the
Cardinal
And
hang
a
calfsskin
on
his
recreant
limbs
Well
ruffian
I
must
pocket
up
these
wrongs
Because
Your
breeches
best
may
carry
them
Philip
what
sayst
thou
to
the
Cardinal
What
should
he
say
but
as
the
Cardinal
Bethink
you
father
for
the
difference
Is
purchase
of
a
heavy
curse
from
Rome
Or
the
light
loss
of
England
for
a
friend
Forgo
the
easier
Thats
the
curse
of
Rome
Lewis
stand
fast
The
devil
tempts
thee
here
In
likeness
of
a
new
untrimmed
bride
The
Lady
Constance
speaks
not
from
her
faith
But
from
her
need
if
thou
grant
my
need
Which
only
lives
but
by
the
death
of
faith
That
need
must
needs
infer
this
principle
That
faith
would
live
again
by
death
of
need
then
tread
down
my
need
and
faith
mounts
up
Keep
my
need
up
and
faith
is
trodden
down
The
King
is
movd
and
answers
not
to
this
be
removd
from
him
and
answer
well
Do
so
King
Philip
hang
no
more
in
doubt
Hang
nothing
but
a
calfsskin
most
sweet
lout
I
am
perplexd
and
know
not
what
to
say
What
canst
thou
say
but
will
perplex
thee
more
If
thou
stand
excommunicate
and
cursd
Good
reverend
father
make
my
person
yours
And
tell
me
how
you
would
bestow
yourself
This
royal
hand
and
mine
are
newly
knit
And
the
conjunction
of
our
inward
souls
Married
in
league
coupled
and
linkd
together
With
all
religious
strength
of
sacred
vows
The
latest
breath
that
gave
the
sound
of
words
Was
deepsworn
faith
peace
amity
true
love
Between
our
kingdoms
and
our
royal
selves
And
even
before
this
truce
but
new
before
No
longer
than
we
well
could
wash
our
hands
To
clap
this
royal
bargain
up
of
peace
Heaven
knows
they
were
besmeard
and
overstaind
With
slaughters
pencil
where
revenge
did
paint
The
fearful
difference
of
incensed
kings
And
shall
these
hands
so
lately
purgd
of
blood
So
newly
joind
in
love
so
strong
in
both
Unyoke
this
seizure
and
this
kind
regreet
Play
fast
and
loose
with
faith
so
jest
with
heaven
Make
such
unconstant
children
of
ourselves
As
now
again
to
snatch
our
palm
from
palm
Unswear
faith
sworn
and
on
the
marriagebed
Of
smiling
peace
to
march
a
bloody
host
And
make
a
riot
on
the
gentle
brow
Of
true
sincerity
holy
sir
My
reverend
father
let
it
not
be
so
Out
of
your
grace
devise
ordain
impose
Some
gentle
order
and
then
we
shall
be
blest
To
do
your
pleasure
and
continue
friends
All
form
is
formless
order
orderless
Save
what
is
opposite
to
Englands
love
Therefore
to
arms
be
champion
of
our
church
Or
let
the
church
our
mother
breathe
her
curse
mothers
curseon
her
revolting
son
France
thou
mayst
hold
a
serpent
by
the
tongue
chafed
lion
by
the
mortal
paw
fasting
tiger
safer
by
the
tooth
Than
keep
in
peace
that
hand
which
thou
dost
hold
I
may
disjoin
my
hand
but
not
my
faith
So
makst
thou
faith
an
enemy
to
faith
And
like
a
civil
war
setst
oath
to
oath
Thy
tongue
against
thy
tongue
let
thy
vow
First
made
to
heaven
first
be
to
heaven
performd
That
is
to
be
the
champion
of
our
Church
What
since
thou
sworst
is
sworn
against
thyself
And
may
not
be
performed
by
thyself
For
that
which
thou
hast
sworn
to
do
amiss
Is
not
amiss
when
it
is
truly
done
And
being
not
done
where
doing
tends
to
ill
The
truth
is
then
most
done
not
doing
it
The
better
act
of
purposes
mistook
Is
to
mistake
again
though
indirect
Yet
indirection
thereby
grows
direct
And
falsehood
cures
as
fire
cools
fire
Within
the
scorched
veins
of
one
newburnd
It
is
religion
that
doth
make
vows
kept
But
thou
hast
sworn
against
religion
By
what
thou
swearst
against
the
thing
thou
swearst
And
makst
an
oath
the
surety
for
thy
truth
Against
an
oath
the
truth
thou
art
unsure
To
swear
swears
only
not
to
be
forsworn
Else
what
a
mockery
should
it
be
to
swear
But
thou
dost
swear
only
to
be
forsworn
And
most
forsworn
to
keep
what
thou
dost
swear
Therefore
thy
later
vows
against
thy
first
Is
in
thyself
rebellion
to
thyself
And
better
conquest
never
canst
thou
make
Than
arm
thy
constant
and
thy
nobler
parts
Against
these
giddy
loose
suggestions
Upon
which
better
part
our
prayrs
come
in
If
thou
vouchsafe
them
But
if
not
then
know
The
peril
of
our
curses
fight
on
thee
So
heavy
as
thou
shalt
not
shake
them
off
But
in
despair
die
under
the
black
weight
Rebellion
flat
rebellion
Willt
not
be
Will
not
a
calfsskin
stop
that
mouth
of
thine
Father
to
arms
Upon
thy
weddingday
Against
the
blood
that
thou
hast
married
What
shall
our
feast
be
kept
with
slaughtered
men
Shall
braying
trumpets
and
loud
churlish
drums
Clamours
of
hell
be
measures
to
our
pomp
husband
hear
me
ay
alack
how
new
Is
husband
in
my
mouth
even
for
that
name
Which
till
this
time
my
tongue
did
neer
pronounce
Upon
my
knee
I
beg
go
not
to
arms
Against
mine
uncle
upon
my
knee
Made
hard
with
kneeling
I
do
pray
to
thee
Thou
virtuous
Dauphin
alter
not
the
doom
Forethought
by
heaven
Now
shall
I
see
thy
love
What
motive
may
Be
stronger
with
thee
than
the
name
of
wife
That
which
upholdeth
him
that
thee
upholds
His
honour
thine
honour
Lewis
thine
honour
I
muse
your
Majesty
doth
seem
so
cold
When
such
profound
respects
do
pull
you
on
I
will
denounce
a
curse
upon
his
head
Thou
shalt
not
need
England
I
will
fall
from
thee
fair
return
of
banishd
majesty
foul
revolt
of
French
inconstancy
France
thou
shalt
rue
this
hour
within

Old
Time

clocksetter
that
bald
sexton
Time
Is
it
as
he
will
Well
then
France
shall
rue
The
suns
oercast
with
blood
Fair
day
adieu
Which
is
the
side
that
I
must
go
withal
I
am
with
both
each

hath
a
hand
And
in
their
rage

of

They
whirl

and
dismember
me
Husband
I
cannot
pray
that
thou

Uncle
I
needs
must
pray
that
thou
mayst
lose
Father
I
may
not

Grandam
I

Whoever

I
lose
Assured

Lady

There

Cousin

France
I
am
burnd
up
with
inflaming
wrath
rage
whose
heat
hath
this
condition
That
nothing
can
allay
nothing
but
blood
The

blood
of
France
Thy
rage
shall
burn
thee
up
and
thou
shalt
turn
To
ashes
ere
our

shall
quench
that
fire
Look
to

No

To

To

And

Of

Set

Must

now

Use

Bell

When
gold
and

becks

For
your

So
I
kiss
your

Farewell
gentle
cousin
Coz
farewell
Come
hither
little
kinsman
hark
a
word
Come
hither
Hubert
my
gentle
Hubert
We
owe
thee
much
Within
this
wall
of
flesh
There
is
a
soul
counts
thee
her
creditor
And
with
advantage
means
to
pay
thy
love
And
my
good
friend
thy
voluntary
oath
Lives
in
this
bosom
dearly
cherished
Give
me
thy
hand
I
had
a
thing
to
say
But
I
will
fit
it
with
some
better
time
By
heaven
Hubert
I
am
almost
ashamd
To
say
what
good
respect
I
have
of
thee
I
am
much
bounden
to
your
Majesty
Good
friend
thou
hast
no
cause
to
say
so
yet
But
thou
shalt
have
and
creep
time
neer
so
slow
Yet
it
shall
come
for
me
to
do
thee
good
I
had
a
thing
to
saybut
let
it
go
The
sun
is
in
the
heaven
and
the
proud
day
Attended
with
the
pleasures
of
the
world
Is
all
too
wanton
and
too
full
of
gawds
To
give
me
audience
If
the
midnight
bell
Did
with
his
iron
tongue
and
brazen
mouth
Sound
on
into
the
drowsy
race
of
night
If
this
same
were
a
churchyard
where
we
stand
And
thou
possessed
with
a
thousand
wrongs
Or
if
that
surly
spirit
melancholy
Had
bakd
thy
blood
and
made
it
heavythick
Which
else
runs
tickling
up
and
down
the
veins
Making
that
idiot
laughter
keep
mens
eyes
And
strain
their
cheeks
to
idle
merriment
passion
hateful
to
my
purposes
Or
if
that
thou
couldst
see
me
without
eyes
Hear
me
without
thine
cars
and
make
reply
Without
a
tongue
using
conceit
alone
Without
eyes
ears
and
harmful
sound
of
words
Then
in
despite
of
brooded
watchful
day
I
would
into
thy
bosom
pour
my
thoughts
But
ah
I
will
not
Yet
I
love
thee
well
And
by
my
troth
I
think
thou
lovst
me
well
So
well
that
what
you
bid
me
undertake
Though
that
my
death
were
adjunct
to
my
act
By
heaven
I
would
do
it
Do
not
I
know
thou
wouldst
Good
Hubert
Hubert
Hubert
throw
thine
eye
On
yon
young
boy
Ill
tell
thee
what
my
friend
He
is
a
very
serpent
in
my
way
And
wheresoeer
this
foot
of
mine
doth
tread
He
lies
before
me
Dost
thou
understand
me
Thou
art
his
keeper
And
Ill
keep
him
so
That
he
shall
not
offend
your
Majesty
Death
My
lord
grave
He
shall
not
live
Enough
I
could
be
merry
now
Hubert
I
love
thee
Well
Ill
not
say
what
I
intend
for
thee
Remember
Madam
fare
you
well
Ill
send
those
powers
oer
to
your
Majesty
My
blessing
go
with
thee
To
For
England
cousin
go
Hubert
shall
be
your
man
attend
on
you
With
all
true
duty
On
toward
Calais
ho
Here
once
again
we
sit
once
again
crownd
And
lookd
upon
I
hope
with
cheerful
eyes
This
once
again
but
that
your
Highness
pleasd
Was
once
superfluous
you
were
crownd
before
And
that
high
royalty
was
neer
pluckd
off
The
faiths
of
men
neer
stained
with
revolt
Fresh
expectation
troubled
not
the
land
With
any
longdfor
change
or
better
state
Therefore
to
be
possessd
with
double
pomp
To
guard
a
title
that
was
rich
before
To
gild
refined
gold
to
paint
the
lily
To
throw
a
perfume
on
the
violet
To
smooth
the
ice
or
add
another
hue
Unto
the
rainbow
or
with
taperlight
To
seek
the
beauteous
eye
of
heaven
to
garnish
Is
wasteful
and
ridiculous
excess
But
that
your
royal
pleasure
must
be
done
This
act
is
as
an
ancient
tale
new
told
And
in
the
last
repeating
troublesome
Being
urged
at
a
time
unseasonable
In
this
the
antique
and
wellnoted
face
Of
plain
old
form
is
much
disfigured
And
like
a
shifted
wind
unto
a
sail
It
makes
the
course
of
thoughts
to
fetch
about
Startles
and
frights
consideration
Makes
sound
opinion
sick
and
truth
suspected
For
putting
on
so
new
a
fashiond
robe
When
workmen
strive
to
do
better
than
well
They
do
confound
their
skill
in
covetousness
And
oftentimes
excusing
of
a
fault
Doth
make
the
fault
the
worse
by
th
excuse
As
patches
set
upon
a
little
breach
Discredit
more
in
hiding
of
the
fault
Than
did
the
fault
before
it
was
so
patchd
To
this
effect
before
you
were
newcrownd
We
breathd
our
counsel
but
it
pleasd
your
Highness
To
overbear
it
and
we
are
all
well
pleasd
Since
all
and
every
part
of
what
we
would
Doth
make
a
stand
at
what
your
Highness
will
Some
reasons
of
this
double
coronation
I
have
possessd
you
with
and
think
them
strong
And
more
more
strong
when
lesser
is
my
fear
I
shall
indue
you
with
Meantime
but
ask
What
you
would
have
reformd
that
is
not
well
And
well
shall
you
perceive
how
willingly
I
will
both
hear
and
grant
you
your
requests
Then
I
as
one
that
am
the
tongue
of
these
To
sound
the
purposes
of
all
their
hearts
Both
for
myself
and
them
but
chief
of
all
Your
safety
for
the
which
myself
and
them
Bend
their
best
studies
heartily
request
Th
enfranchisement
of
Arthur
whose
restraint
Doth
move
the
murmuring
lips
of
discontent
To
break
into
this
dangerous
argument
If
what
in
rest
you
have
in
right
you
hold
Why
then
your
fearswhich
as
they
say
attend
The
steps
of
wrongshould
move
you
to
mew
up
Your
tender
kinsman
and
to
choke
his
days
With
barbarous
ignorance
and
deny
his
youth
The
rich
advantage
of
good
exercise
That
the
times
enemies
may
not
have
this
To
grace
occasions
let
it
be
our
suit
That
you
have
bid
us
ask
his
liberty
Which
for
our
goods
we
do
no
further
ask
Than
whereupon
our
weal
on
you
depending
Counts
it
your
weal
he
have
his
liberty
Let
it
be
so
I
do
commit
his
youth
To
your
direction
Enter
Aside
Hubert
what
news
with
you
This
is
the
man
should
do
the
bloody
deed
He
showd
his
warrant
to
a
friend
of
mine
The
image
of
a
wicked
heinous
fault
Lives
in
his
eye
that
close
aspect
of
his
Doth
show
the
mood
of
a
much
troubled
breast
And
I
do
fearfully
believe
tis
done
What
we
so
feard
he
had
a
charge
to
do
The
colour
of
the
King
doth
come
and
go
Between
his
purpose
and
his
conscience
Like
heralds
twixt
two
dreadful
battles
set
His
passion
is
so
ripe
it
needs
must
break
And
when
it
breaks
I
fear
will
issue
thence
The
foul
corruption
of
a
sweet
childs
death
We
cannot
hold
mortalitys
strong
hand
Good
lords
although
my
will
to
give
is
living
The
suit
which
you
demand
is
gone
and
dead
He
tells
us
Arthur
is
deceasd
tonight
Indeed
we
feard
his
sickness
was
past
cure
Indeed
we
heard
how
near
his
death
he
was
Before
the
child
himself
felt
he
was
sick
This
must
be
answerd
either
here
or
hence
Why
do
you
bend
such
solemn
brows
on
me
Think
you
I
bear
the
shears
of
destiny
Have
I
commandment
on
the
pulse
of
life
It
is
apparent
foulplay
and
tis
shame
That
greatness
should
so
grossly
offer
it
So
thrive
it
in
your
game
and
so
farewell
Stay
yet
Lord
Salisbury
Ill
go
with
thee
And
find
th
inheritance
of
this
poor
child
His
little
kingdom
of
a
forced
grave
That
blood
which
owd
the
breadth
of
all
this
isle
Three
foot
of
it
doth
holdbad
world
the
while
This
must
not
be
thus
borne
this
will
break
out
To
all
our
sorrows
and
ere
long
I
doubt
They
burn
in
indignation
I
repent
There
is
no
sure
foundation
set
on
blood
No
certain
life
achievd
by
others
death
Enter
a
fearful
eye
thou
hast
where
is
that
blood
That
I
have
seen
inhabit
in
those
cheeks
So
foul
a
sky
clears
not
without
a
storm
Pour
down
thy
weatherhow
goes
all
in
France
From
France
to
England
Never
such
a
powr
For
any
foreign
preparation
Was
levied
in
the
body
of
a
land
The
copy
of
your
speed
is
learnd
by
them
For
when
you
should
be
told
they
do
prepare
The
tidings
comes
that
they
are
all
arrivd
where
hath
our
intelligence
been
drunk
Where
hath
it
slept
Where
is
my
mothers
care
That
such
an
army
could
be
drawn
in
France
And
she
not
hear
of
it
My
liege
her
ear
Is
stoppd
with
dust
the
first
of
April
died
Your
noble
mother
and
as
I
hear
my
lord
The
Lady
Constance
in
a
frenzy
died
Three
days
before
but
this
from
rumours
tongue
I
idly
heardif
true
or
false
I
know
not
Withhold
thy
speed
dreadful
occasion
make
a
league
with
me
till
I
have
pleasd
My
discontented
peers
What
mother
dead
How
wildly
then
walks
my
estate
in
France
Under
whose
conduct
came
those
powrs
of
France
That
thou
for
truth
givst
out
are
landed
here
Under
the
Dauphin
Thou
hast
made
me
giddy
With
these
in
tidings
Enter
the
and
Now
What
says
the
world
To
your
proceedings
Do
not
seek
to
stuff
My
head
with
more
ill
news
for
it
is
fun
But
if
you
be
afeard
to
hear
the
worst
Then
let
the
worst
unheard
fall
on
your
head
Bear
with
me
cousin
for
I
was
amazd
Under
the
tide
but
now
I
breathe
again
Aloft
the
flood
and
can
give
audience
To
any
tongue
speak
it
of
what
it
will
How
I
have
sped
among
the
clergymen
The
sums
I
have
collected
shall
express
But
as
I
travelld
hither
through
the
land
I
find
the
people
strangely
fantasied
Possessd
with
rumours
full
of
idle
dreams
Not
knowing
what
they
fear
but
full
of
fear
And
heres
a
prophet
that
I
brought
with
me
From
forth
the
streets
of
Pomfret
whom
I
found
With
many
hundreds
treading
on
his
heels
To
whom
he
sung
in
rude
harshsounding
rhymes
That
ere
the
next
Ascensionday
at
noon
Your
Highness
should
deliver
up
your
crown
Thou
idle
dreamer
wherefore
didst
thou
so
Foreknowing
that
the
truth
will
fall
out
so
Hubert
away
with
him
imprison
him
And
on
that
day
at
noon
whereon
he
says
I
shall
yield
up
my
crown
let
him
be
hangd
Deliver
him
to
safety
and
return
For
I
must
use
thee
my
gentle
cousin
Hearst
thou
the
news
abroad
who
are
arrivd
The
French
my
lord
mens
mouths
are
full
of
it
Besides
I
met
Lord
Bigot
and
Lord
Salisbury
With
eyes
as
red
as
newenkindled
fire
And
others
more
going
to
seek
the
grave
Of
Arthur
whom
they
say
is
killd
tonight
On
your
suggestion
Gentle
kinsman
go
And
thrust
thyself
into
their
companies
I
have
a
way
to
will
their
loves
again
Bring
them
before
me
I
Will
seek
them
out
Nay
but
make
haste
the
better
foot
before
let
me
have
no
subject
enemies
When
adverse
foreigners
affright
my
towns
With
dreadful
pomp
of
stout
invasion
Be
Mercury
set
feathers
to
thy
heels
And
fly
like
thought
from
them
to
me
again
The
spirit
of
the
time
shall
teach
me
speed
Spoke
like
a
sprightful
noble
gentleman
Go
after
him
for
he
perhaps
shall
need
Some
messenger
betwixt
me
and
the
peers
And
be
thou
he
With
all
my
heart
my
liege
My
mother
dead
Reenter
My
lord
they
say
five
moons
were
seen
tonight
Four
fixed
and
the
fifth
did
whirl
about
The
other
four
in
wondrous
motion
Five
moons
Old
men
and
beldams
in
the
streets
Do
prophesy
upon
it
dangerously
Young
Arthurs
death
is
common
in
their
mouths
And
when
they
talk
of
him
they
shake
their
heads
And
whisper
one
another
in
the
ear
And
he
that
speaks
doth
gripe
the
hearers
wrist
Whilst
he
that
hears
makes
fearful
action
With
wrinkled
brows
with
nods
with
rolling
eyes
I
saw
a
smith
stand
with
his
hammer
thus
The
whilst
his
iron
did
on
the
anvil
cool
With
open
mouth
swallowing
a
tailors
news
Who
with
his
shears
and
measure
in
his
hand
Standing
on
slippers
which
his
nimble
haste
Had
falsely
thrust
upon
contrary
feet
Told
of
a
many
thousand
warlike
French
That
were
embattailed
and
rankd
in
Kent
Another
lean
unwashd
artificer
Cuts
off
his
tale
and
talks
of
Arthurs
death
Why
seekst
thou
to
possess
me
with
these
fears
Why
urgest
thou
so
oft
young
Arthurs
death
Thy
hand
hath
murdred
him
I
had
a
mighty
cause
To
wish
him
dead
but
thou
hadst
none
to
kill
him
No
had
my
lord
Why
did
you
not
provoke
me
It
is
the
curse
of
kings
to
be
attended
By
slaves
that
take
their
humours
for
a
warrant
To
break
within
the
bloody
house
of
life
And
on
the
winking
of
authority
To
understand
a
law
to
know
the
meaning
Of
dangerous
majesty
when
perchance
it
frowns
More
upon
humour
than
advisd
respect
Here
is
your
hand
and
seal
for
what
I
did
when
the
last
account
twixt
heaven
and
earth
Is
to
be
made
then
shall
this
hand
and
seal
Witness
against
us
to
damnation
How
oft
the
sight
of
means
to
do
ill
deeds
Make
deeds
ill
done
Hadst
not
thou
been
by
fellow
by
the
hand
of
nature
markd
Quoted
and
signd
to
do
a
deed
of
shame
This
murder
had
not
come
into
my
mind
But
taking
note
of
thy
abhorrd
aspect
Finding
thee
fit
for
bloody
villainy
Apt
liable
to
be
employd
in
danger
I
faintly
broke
with
thee
of
Arthurs
death
And
thou
to
be
endeared
to
a
king
Made
it
no
conscience
to
destroy
a
prince
My
lord
Hadst
thou
but
shook
thy
head
or
made
pause
When
I
spake
darkly
what
I
purposed
Or
turnd
an
eye
of
doubt
upon
my
face
As
bid
me
tell
my
tale
in
express
words
Deep
shame
had
struck
me
dumb
made
me
break
off
And
those
thy
fears
might
have
wrought
fears
in
me
But
thou
didst
understand
me
by
my
signs
And
didst
in
signs
again
parley
with
sin
Yea
without
stop
didst
let
thy
heart
consent
And
consequently
thy
rude
hand
to
act
The
deed
which
both
our
tongues
held
vile
to
name
Out
of
my
sight
and
never
see
me
more
My
nobles
leave
me
and
my
state
is
braved
Even
at
my
gates
with
ranks
of
foreign
powrs
Nay
in
the
body
of
the
fleshly
land
This
kingdom
this
confine
of
blood
and
breath
Hostility
and
civil
tumult
reigns
Between
my
conscience
and
my
cousins
death
Arm
you
against
your
other
enemies
Ill
make
a
peace
between
your
soul
and
you
Young
Arthur
is
alive
This
hand
of
mine
Is
yet
a
maiden
and
an
innocent
hand
Not
painted
with
the
crimson
spots
of
blood
Within
this
bosom
never
entred
yet
The
dreadful
motion
of
a
murderous
thought
And
you
have
slanderd
nature
in
my
form
Which
howsoever
rude
exteriorly
Is
yet
the
cover
of
a
fairer
mind
Than
to
be
butcher
of
an
innocent
child
Doth
Arthur
live
haste
thee
to
the
peers
Throw
this
report
on
their
incensed
rage
And
make
them
tame
to
their
obedience
Forgive
the
comment
that
my
passion
made
Upon
thy
feature
for
my
rage
was
blind
And
foul
imaginary
eyes
of
blood
Presented
thee
more
hideous
than
thou
art
answer
not
but
to
my
closet
bring
The
angry
lords
with
all
expedient
haste
I
conjure
thee
but
slowly
run
more
fast
My
Lord
Melun
let
this
be
copied
out
And
keep
it
safe
for
our
remembrance
Return
the
precedent
to
these
lords
again
That
having
our
fair
order
written
down
Both
they
and
we
perusing
oer
these
notes
May
know
wherefore
we
took
the
sacrament
And
keep
our
faiths
firm
and
inviolable
Upon
our
sides
it
never
shall
be
broken
And
noble
Dauphin
albeit
we
swear
voluntary
zeal
and
an
unurgd
faith
To
your
proceedings
yet
believe
me
Prince
I
am
not
glad
that
such
a
sore
of
time
Should
seek
a
plaster
by
contemnd
revolt
And
heal
the
inveterate
canker
of
one
wound
By
making
many
it
grieves
my
soul
That
I
must
draw
this
metal
from
my
side
To
be
a
widowmaker
and
there
Where
honourable
rescue
and
defence
Cries
out
upon
the
name
of
Salisbury
But
such
is
the
infection
of
the
time
That
for
the
health
and
physic
of
our
right
We
cannot
deal
but
with
the
very
hand
Of
stern
injustice
and
confused
wrong
And
ist
not
pity
my
grieved
friends
That
we
the
sons
and
children
of
this
isle
Were
born
to
see
so
sad
an
hour
as
this
Wherein
we
step
after
a
strangermarch
Upon
her
gentle
bosom
and
fill
up
Her
enemies
ranksI
must
withdraw
and
weep
Upon
the
spot
of
this
enforced
cause
To
grace
the
gentry
of
a
land
remote
And
follow
unacquainted
colours
here
What
here
nation
that
thou
couldst
remove
That
Neptunes
arms
who
clippeth
thee
about
Would
bear
thee
from
the
knowledge
of
thyself
And
grapple
thee
unto
a
pagan
shore
Where
these
two
Christian
armies
might
combine
The
blood
of
malice
in
a
vein
of
league
And
not
to
spend
it
so
unneighbourly
noble
temper
dost
thou
show
in
this
And
great
affections
wrestling
in
thy
bosom
Doth
make
an
earthquake
of
nobility
what
a
noble
combat
hast
thou
fought
Between
compulsion
and
a
brave
respect
Let
me
wipe
off
this
honourable
dew
That
silverly
doth
progress
on
thy
cheeks
My
heart
hath
melted
at
a
ladys
tears
Being
an
ordinary
inundation
But
this
effusion
of
such
manly
drops
This
showr
blown
up
by
tempest
of
the
soul
Startles
mine
eyes
and
makes
me
more
amazd
Than
had
I
seen
the
vaulty
top
of
heaven
Figurd
quite
oer
with
burning
meteors
Lift
up
thy
brow
renowned
Salisbury
And
with
a
great
heart
heave
away
this
storm
Commend
these
waters
to
those
baby
eyes
That
never
saw
the
giant
world
enragd
Nor
met
with
fortune
other
than
at
feasts
Full
of
warm
blood
of
mirth
of
gossiping
Come
come
for
thou
shalt
thrust
thy
hand
as
deep
Into
the
purse
of
rich
prosperity
As
Lewis
himself
So
nobles
shall
you
all
That
knit
your
sinews
to
the
strength
of
mine
Enter
And
even
there
methinks
an
angel
spake
Look
where
the
holy
legate
comes
apace
To
give
us
warrant
from
the
hand
of
heaven
And
on
our
actions
set
the
name
of
right
With
holy
breath
Hail
noble
prince
of
France
The
next
is
this
King
John
hath
reconcild
Himself
to
Rome
his
spirit
is
come
in
That
so
stood
out
against
the
holy
Church
The
great
metropolis
and
see
of
Rome
Therefore
thy
threatning
colours
now
wind
up
And
tame
the
savage
spirit
of
wild
war
That
like
a
lion
fostered
up
at
hand
It
may
lie
gently
at
the
foot
of
peace
And
be
no
further
harmful
than
in
show
Your
Grace
shall
pardon
me
I
will
not
back
I
am
too
highborn
to
be
propertied
To
be
a
secondary
at
control
Or
useful
servingman
and
instrument
To
any
sovereign
state
throughout
the
world
Your
breath
first
kindled
the
dead
coal
of
wars
Between
this
chastisd
kingdom
and
myself
And
brought
in
matter
that
should
feed
this
fire
And
now
tis
far
too
huge
to
be
blown
out
With
that
same
weak
wind
which
enkindled
it
You
taught
me
how
to
know
the
face
of
right
Acquainted
me
with
interest
to
this
land
Yea
thrust
this
enterprise
into
my
heart
And
come
ye
now
to
tell
me
John
hath
made
His
peace
with
Rome
What
is
that
peace
to
me
I
by
the
honour
of
my
marriagebed
After
young
Arthur
claim
this
land
for
mine
And
now
it
is
halfconquerd
must
I
back
Because
that
John
hath
made
his
peace
with
Rome
Am
I
Romes
slave
What
penny
hath
Rome
borne
What
men
provided
what
munition
sent
To
underprop
this
action
Is
t
not
I
That
undergo
this
charge
Who
else
but
I
And
such
as
to
my
claim
are
liable
Sweat
in
this
business
and
maintain
this
war
Have
I
not
heard
these
islanders
shout
out
Vive
le
roi
as
I
have
bankd
their
towns
Have
I
not
here
the
best
cards
for
the
game
To
will
this
easy
match
playd
for
a
crown
And
shall
I
now
give
oer
the
yielded
set
No
no
on
my
soul
it
never
shall
be
said
You
look
but
on
the
outside
of
this
work
Outside
or
inside
I
will
not
return
Till
my
attempt
so
much
be
glorified
As
to
my
ample
hope
was
promised
Before
I
drew
this
gallant
head
of
war
And
culld
these
fiery
spirits
from
the
world
To
outlook
conquest
and
to
will
renown
Even
in
the
jaws
of
danger
and
of
death
Trumpet
sounds
What
lusty
trumpet
thus
doth
summon
us
Enter
the
attended
According
to
the
fair
play
of
the
world
Let
me
have
audience
I
am
sent
to
speak
My
holy
lord
of
Milan
from
the
King
I
come
to
learn
how
you
have
dealt
for
him
And
as
you
answer
I
do
know
the
scope
And
warrant
limited
unto
my
tongue
The
Dauphin
is
too
wilfulopposite
And
will
not
temporize
with
my
entreaties
He
flatly
says
hell
not
lay
down
his
arms
By
all
the
blood
that
ever
fury
breathd
The
youth
says
well
Now
hear
our
English
King
For
thus
his
royalty
doth
speak
in
me
He
is
prepard
and
reason
too
he
should
This
apish
and
unmannerly
approach
This
harnessd
masque
and
unadvised
revel
This
unhaird
sauciness
and
boyish
troops
The
King
doth
smile
at
and
is
well
prepard
To
whip
this
dwarfish
war
these
pigmy
arms
From
out
the
circle
of
his
territories
That
hand
which
had
the
strength
even
at
your
door
To
cudgel
you
and
make
you
take
the
hatch
To
dive
like
buckets
in
concealed
wells
To
crouch
in
litter
of
your
stable
planks
To
lie
like
pawns
lockd
up
in
chests
and
trunks
To
hug
with
swine
to
seek
sweet
safety
out
In
vaults
and
prisons
and
to
thrill
and
shake
Even
at
the
crying
of
your
nations
crow
Thinking
this
voice
an
armed
Englishman
Shall
that
victorious
hand
be
feebled
here
That
in
your
chambers
gave
you
chastisement
No
Know
the
gallant
monarch
is
in
arms
And
like
an
eagle
oer
his
aery
towrs
To
souse
annoyance
that
comes
near
his
nest
And
you
degenerate
you
ingrate
revolts
You
bloody
Neroes
ripping
up
the
womb
Of
your
dear
mother
England
blush
for
shame
For
your
own
ladies
and
palevisagd
maids
Like
Amazons
come
tripping
after
drums
Their
thimbles
into
armed
gauntlets
change
Their
needles
to
lances
and
their
gentle
hearts
To
fierce
and
bloody
inclination
There
end
thy
brave
and
turn
thy
face
in
peace
We
grant
thou
canst
outscold
us
Fare
thee
well
We
hold
our
time
too
precious
to
be
spent
With
such
a
brabbler
Give
me
leave
to
speak
No
I
will
speak
We
will
attend
to
neither
Strike
up
the
drums
and
let
the
tongue
of
war
Plead
for
our
interest
and
our
being
here
Indeed
your
drums
being
beaten
will
cry
out
And
so
shall
you
being
beaten
Do
but
start
And
echo
with
the
clamour
of
thy
drum
And
even
at
hand
a
drum
is
ready
bracd
That
shall
reverberate
all
as
loud
as
thine
Sound
but
another
and
another
shall
As
loud
as
thine
rattle
the
welkins
ear
And
mock
the
deepmouthd
thunder
for
at
hand
Not
trusting
to
this
halting
legate
here
Whom
he
hath
usd
rather
for
sport
than
need
Is
warlike
John
and
in
his
forehead
sits
bareribbd
death
whose
office
is
this
day
To
feast
upon
whole
thousands
of
the
French
Strike
up
our
drums
to
find
this
danger
out
And
thou
shalt
find
it
Dauphin
do
not
doubt
I
did
not
think
the
King
so
stord
with
friends
Up
once
again
put
spirit
in
the
French
If
they
miscarry
we
miscarry
too
That
misbegotten
devil
Faulconbridge
In
spite
of
spite
alone
upholds
the
day
They
say
King
John
sore
sick
hath
left
the
field
Enter
wounded
Lead
me
to
the
revolts
of
England
here
When
we
were
happy
we
had
other
names
It
is
the
Count
Melun
Wounded
to
death
Fly
noble
English
you
are
bought
and
sold
Unthread
the
rude
eye
of
rebellion
And
welcome
home
again
discarded
faith
Seek
out
King
John
and
fall
before
his
feet
For
if
the
French
be
lords
of
this
loud
day
He
means
to
recompense
the
pains
you
take
By
cutting
off
your
heads
Thus
hath
he
sworn
And
I
with
him
and
many
moe
with
me
Upon
the
altar
at
Saint
Edmundsbury
Even
on
that
altar
where
we
swore
to
you
Dear
amity
and
everlasting
love
May
this
be
possible
May
this
be
true
Have
I
not
hideous
death
within
my
view
Retaining
but
a
quantity
of
life
Which
bleeds
away
even
as
a
form
of
wax
Resolveth
from
his
figure
gainst
the
fire
What
in
the
world
should
make
me
now
deceive
Since
I
must
lose
the
use
of
all
deceit
Why
should
I
then
be
false
since
it
is
true
That
I
must
die
here
and
live
hence
by
truth
I
say
again
if
Lewis
do
will
the
day
He
is
forsworn
if
eer
those
eyes
of
yours
Behold
another
day
break
in
the
east
But
even
this
night
whose
black
contagious
breath
Already
smokes
about
the
burning
crest
Of
the
old
feeble
and
daywearied
sun
Even
this
ill
night
your
breathing
shall
expire
Paying
the
fine
of
rated
treachery
Even
with
a
treacherous
fine
of
all
your
lives
If
Lewis
by
your
assistance
win
the
day
Commend
me
to
one
Hubert
with
your
King
The
love
of
himand
this
respect
besides
For
that
my
grandsire
was
an
Englishman
Awakes
my
conscience
to
confess
all
this
In
lieu
whereof
I
pray
you
bear
me
hence
From
forth
the
noise
and
rumour
of
the
field
Where
I
may
think
the
remnant
of
my
thoughts
In
peace
and
part
this
body
and
my
soul
With
contemplation
and
devout
desires
We
do
believe
thee
and
beshrew
my
soul
But
I
do
love
the
favour
and
the
form
Of
this
most
fair
occasion
by
the
which
We
will
untread
the
steps
of
damned
flight
And
like
a
bated
and
retired
flood
Leaving
our
rankness
and
irregular
course
Stoop
low
within
those
bounds
we
have
oerlookd
And
calmly
run
on
in
obedience
Even
to
our
ocean
to
great
King
John
My
arm
shall
give
thee
help
to
bear
thee
hence
For
I
do
see
the
cruel
pangs
of
death
Right
in
thine
eye
Away
my
friends
New
flight
And
happy
newness
that
intends
old
right
Whos
there
Speak
ho
speak
quickly
or
I
shoot
friend
What
art
thou
Of
the
part
of
England
Whither
dost
thou
go
Whats
that
to
thee
Why
may
I
not
demand
Of
thine
affairs
as
well
as
thou
of
mine
Hubert
I
think
Thou
hast
a
perfect
thought
I
will
upon
all
hazards
well
believe
Thou
art
my
friend
that
knowst
my
tongue
so
well
Who
art
thou
Who
thou
wilt
And
if
thou
please
Thou
mayst
befriend
me
so
much
as
to
think
I
come
one
way
of
the
Plantagenets
Unkind
remembrance
thou
and
eyeless
night
Have
done
me
shame
Brave
soldier
pardon
me
That
any
accent
breaking
from
thy
tongue
Should
scape
the
true
acquaintance
of
mine
ear
Come
come
sans
compliment
what
news
abroad
Why
here
walk
I
in
the
black
brow
of
night
To
find
you
out
Brief
then
and
whats
the
news
my
sweet
sir
news
fitting
to
the
night
Black
fearful
comfortless
and
horrible
Show
me
the
very
wound
of
this
ill
news
I
am
no
woman
Ill
not
swoon
at
it
The
King
I
fear
is
poisond
by
a
monk
I
left
him
almost
speechless
and
broke
out
To
acquaint
you
with
this
evil
that
you
might
The
better
arm
you
to
the
sudden
time
Than
if
you
had
at
leisure
known
of
this
How
did
he
take
it
who
did
taste
to
him
monk
I
tell
you
a
resolved
villain
Whose
bowels
suddenly
burst
out
The
King
Yet
speaks
and
peradventure
may
recover
Who
didst
thou
leave
to
tend
his
Majesty
Why
know
you
not
The
lords
are
all
come
back
And
brought
Prince
Henry
in
their
company
At
whose
request
the
King
hath
pardond
them
And
they
are
all
about
his
Majesty
Withhold
thine
indignation
mighty
heaven
And
tempt
us
not
to
bear
above
our
power
Ill
tell
thee
Hubert
half
my
power
this
night
Passing
these
flats
are
taken
by
the
tide
These
Lincoln
Washes
have
devoured
them
Myself
wellmounted
hardly
have
escapd
Away
before
conduct
me
to
the
King
I
doubt
he
will
be
dead
or
ere
I
come
I
I
Rome
street
Enter
Flavius
Marullus
and
certain
Commoners
Hence
home
you
idle
creatures
get
you
home
Is
this
a
holiday
What
know
you
not
Being
mechanical
you
ought
not
walk
Upon
a
laboring
day
without
the
sign
Of
your
profession
Speak
what
trade
art
thou
Why
sir
a
carpenter
Where
is
thy
leather
apron
and
thy
rule
What
dost
thou
with
thy
best
apparel
on
You
sir
what
trade
are
you
Truly
sir
in
respect
of
a
fine
workman
I
am
but
as
you
would
say
a
cobbler
But
what
trade
art
thou
Answer
me
directly
trade
sir
that
I
hope
I
may
use
with
a
safe
conscience
which
is
indeed
sir
a
mender
of
bad
soles
What
trade
thou
knave
Thou
naughty
knave
what
trade
Nay
I
beseech
you
sir
be
not
out
with
me
yet
if
you
be
out
sir
I
can
mend
you
What
meanst
thou
by
that
Mend
me
thou
saucy
fellow
Why
sir
cobble
you
Thou
art
a
cobbler
art
thou
Truly
Sir
all
that
I
live
by
is
with
the
awl
I
meddle
with
no
tradesmans
matters
nor
womens
matters
but
with
awl
I
am
indeed
sir
a
surgeon
to
old
shoes
when
they
are
in
great
danger
I
recover
them
As
proper
men
as
ever
trod
upon
neats
leather
have
gone
upon
my
handiwork
But
wherefore
art
not
in
thy
shop
today
Why
dost
thou
lead
these
men
about
the
streets
Truly
sir
to
wear
out
their
shoes
to
get
myself
into
more
work
But
indeed
sir
we
make
holiday
to
see
Caesar
and
to
rejoice
in
his
triumph
Wherefore
rejoice
What
conquest
brings
he
home
What
tributaries
follow
him
to
Rome
To
grace
in
captive
bonds
his
chariot
wheels
You
blocks
you
stones
you
worse
than
senseless
things
you
hard
hearts
you
cruel
men
of
Rome
Knew
you
not
Pompey
Many
a
time
and
oft
Have
you
climbd
up
to
walls
and
battlements
To
towers
and
windows
yea
to
chimney
tops
Your
infants
in
your
arms
and
there
have
sat
The
livelong
day
with
patient
expectation
To
see
great
Pompey
pass
the
streets
of
Rome
And
when
you
saw
his
chariot
but
appear
Have
you
not
made
an
universal
shout
That
Tiber
trembled
underneath
her
banks
To
hear
the
replication
of
your
sounds
Made
in
her
concave
shores
And
do
you
now
put
on
your
best
attire
And
do
you
now
cull
out
a
holiday
And
do
you
now
strew
flowers
in
his
way
That
comes
in
triumph
over
Pompeys
blood
Be
gone
Run
to
your
houses
fall
upon
your
knees
Pray
to
the
gods
to
intermit
the
plague
That
needs
must
light
on
this
ingratitude
Go
go
good
countrymen
and
for
this
fault
Assemble
all
the
poor
men
of
your
sort
Draw
them
to
Tiber
banks
and
weep
your
tears
Into
the
channel
till
the
lowest
stream
Do
kiss
the
most
exalted
shores
of
all
See
whether
their
basest
metal
be
not
moved
They
vanish
tonguetied
in
their
guiltiness
Go
you
down
that
way
towards
the
Capitol
This
way
will
I
Disrobe
the
images
If
you
do
find
them
deckd
with
ceremonies
May
we
do
so
You
know
it
is
the
feast
of
Lupercal
It
is
no
matter
let
no
images
Be
hung
with
Caesars
trophies
Ill
about
And
drive
away
the
vulgar
from
the
streets
So
do
you
too
where
you
perceive
them
thick
These
growing
feathers
pluckd
from
Caesars
wing
Will
make
him
fly
an
ordinary
pitch
Who
else
would
soar
above
the
view
of
men
And
keep
us
all
in
servile
fearfulness
street
Thunder
and
lightning
Enter
from
opposite
sides
Casca
with
his
sword
drawn
and
Cicero
Good
even
Casca
Brought
you
Caesar
home
Why
are
you
breathless
and
why
stare
you
so
Are
not
you
moved
when
all
the
sway
of
earth
Shakes
like
a
thing
unfirm
Cicero
I
have
seen
tempests
when
the
scolding
winds
Have
rived
the
knotty
oaks
and
I
have
seen
The
ambitious
ocean
swell
and
rage
and
foam
To
be
exalted
with
the
threatening
clouds
But
never
till
tonight
never
till
now
Did
I
go
through
a
tempest
dropping
fire
Either
there
is
a
civil
strife
in
heaven
Or
else
the
world
too
saucy
with
the
gods
Incenses
them
to
send
destruction
Why
saw
you
anything
more
wonderful
common
slave
you
know
him
well
by
sight
Held
up
his
left
hand
which
did
flame
and
burn
Like
twenty
torches
joind
and
yet
his
hand
Not
sensible
of
fire
remaind
unscorchd
Besides
I
ha
not
since
put
up
my
sword
Against
the
Capitol
I
met
a
lion
Who
glazd
upon
me
and
went
surly
by
Without
annoying
me
And
there
were
drawn
Upon
a
heap
a
hundred
ghastly
women
Transformed
with
their
fear
who
swore
they
saw
Men
all
in
fire
walk
up
and
down
the
streets
And
yesterday
the
bird
of
night
did
sit
Even
at
noonday
upon
the
marketplace
Howling
and
shrieking
When
these
prodigies
Do
so
conjointly
meet
let
not
men
say
These
are
their
reasons
they
are
natural
For
I
believe
they
are
portentous
things
Unto
the
climate
that
they
point
upon
Indeed
it
is
a
strangedisposed
time
But
men
may
construe
things
after
their
fashion
Clean
from
the
purpose
of
the
things
themselves
Comes
Caesar
to
the
Capitol
tomorrow
He
doth
for
he
did
bid
Antonio
Send
word
to
you
he
would
be
there
tomorrow
Good
then
Casca
This
disturbed
sky
Is
not
to
walk
in
Farewell
Cicero
Enter
Cassius
Whos
there
Roman
Casca
by
your
voice
Your
ear
is
good
Cassius
what
night
is
this
very
pleasing
night
to
honest
men
Who
ever
knew
the
heavens
menace
so
Those
that
have
known
the
earth
so
full
of
faults
For
my
part
I
have
walkd
about
the
streets
Submitting
me
unto
the
perilous
night
And
thus
unbraced
Casca
as
you
see
Have
bared
my
bosom
to
the
thunderstone
And
when
the
cross
blue
lightning
seemd
to
open
The
breast
of
heaven
I
did
present
myself
Even
in
the
aim
and
very
flash
of
it
But
wherefore
did
you
so
much
tempt
the
heavens
It
is
the
part
of
men
to
fear
and
tremble
When
the
most
mighty
gods
by
tokens
send
Such
dreadful
heralds
to
astonish
us
You
are
dull
Casca
and
those
sparks
of
life
That
should
be
in
a
Roman
you
do
want
Or
else
you
use
not
You
look
pale
and
gaze
And
put
on
fear
and
cast
yourself
in
wonder
To
see
the
strange
impatience
of
the
heavens
But
if
you
would
consider
the
true
cause
Why
all
these
fires
why
all
these
gliding
ghosts
Why
birds
and
beasts
from
quality
and
kind
Why
old
men
fools
and
children
calculate
Why
all
these
things
change
from
their
ordinance
Their
natures
and
preformed
faculties
To
monstrous
quality
why
you
shall
find
That
heaven
hath
infused
them
with
these
spirits
To
make
them
instruments
of
fear
and
warning
Unto
some
monstrous
state
Now
could
I
Casca
name
to
thee
a
man
Most
like
this
dreadful
night
That
thunders
lightens
opens
graves
and
roars
As
doth
the
lion
in
the
Capitol
man
no
mightier
than
thyself
or
me
In
personal
action
yet
prodigious
grown
And
fearful
as
these
strange
eruptions
are
Tis
Caesar
that
you
mean
is
it
not
Cassius
Let
it
be
who
it
is
for
Romans
now
Have
thews
and
limbs
like
to
their
ancestors
But
woe
the
while
Our
fathers
minds
are
dead
And
we
are
governd
with
our
mothers
spirits
Our
yoke
and
sufferance
show
us
womanish
Indeed
they
say
the
senators
tomorrow
Mean
to
establish
Caesar
as
a
king
And
he
shall
wear
his
crown
by
sea
and
land
In
every
place
save
here
in
Italy
I
know
where
I
will
wear
this
dagger
then
Cassius
from
bondage
will
deliver
Cassius
Therein
ye
gods
you
make
the
weak
most
strong
Therein
ye
gods
you
tyrants
do
defeat
Nor
stony
tower
nor
walls
of
beaten
brass
Nor
airless
dungeon
nor
strong
links
of
iron
Can
be
retentive
to
the
strength
of
spirit
But
life
being
weary
of
these
worldly
bars
Never
lacks
power
to
dismiss
itself
If
I
know
this
know
all
the
world
besides
That
part
of
tyranny
that
I
do
bear
I
can
shake
off
at
pleasure
Thunder
still
So
can
I
So
every
bondman
in
his
own
hand
bears
The
power
to
cancel
his
captivity
And
why
should
Caesar
be
a
tyrant
then
Poor
man
I
know
he
would
not
be
a
wolf
But
that
he
sees
the
Romans
are
but
sheep
He
were
no
lion
were
not
Romans
hinds
Those
that
with
haste
will
make
a
mighty
fire
Begin
it
with
weak
straws
What
trash
is
Rome
What
rubbish
and
what
offal
when
it
serves
For
the
base
matter
to
illuminate
So
vile
a
thing
as
Caesar
But
grief
Where
hast
thou
led
me
I
perhaps
speak
this
Before
a
willing
bondman
then
I
know
My
answer
must
be
made
But
I
am
armd
And
dangers
are
to
me
indifferent
You
speak
to
Casca
and
to
such
a
man
That
is
no
fleering
telltale
Hold
my
hand
Be
factious
for
redress
of
all
these
griefs
And
I
will
set
this
foot
of
mine
as
far
As
who
goes
farthest
Theres
a
bargain
made
Now
know
you
Casca
I
have
moved
already
Some
certain
of
the
noblestminded
Romans
To
undergo
with
me
an
enterprise
Of
honorabledangerous
consequence
And
I
do
know
by
this
they
stay
for
me
In
Pompeys
Porch
For
now
this
fearful
night
There
is
no
stir
or
walking
in
the
streets
And
the
complexion
of
the
element
In
favors
like
the
work
we
have
in
hand
Most
bloody
fiery
and
most
terrible
Enter
Cinna
Stand
close
awhile
for
here
comes
one
in
haste
Tis
Cinna
I
do
know
him
by
his
gait
He
is
a
friend
Cinna
where
haste
you
so
To
find
out
you
Whos
that
Metellus
Cimber
No
it
is
Casca
one
incorporate
To
our
attempts
Am
I
not
stayd
for
Cinna
I
am
glad
ont
What
a
fearful
night
is
this
Theres
two
or
three
of
us
have
seen
strange
sights
Am
I
not
stayd
for
Tell
me
Yes
you
are
Cassius
if
you
could
But
win
the
noble
Brutus
to
our
party
Be
you
content
Good
Cinna
take
this
paper
And
look
you
lay
it
in
the
praetors
chair
Where
Brutus
may
but
find
it
and
throw
this
In
at
his
window
set
this
up
with
wax
Upon
old
Brutus
statue
All
this
done
Repair
to
Pompeys
Porch
where
you
shall
find
us
Is
Decius
Brutus
and
Trebonius
there
All
but
Metellus
Cimber
and
hes
gone
To
seek
you
at
your
house
Well
I
will
hie
And
so
bestow
these
papers
as
you
bade
me
That
done
repair
to
Pompeys
Theatre
Come
Casca
you
and
I
will
yet
ere
day
See
Brutus
at
his
house
Three
parts
of
him
Is
ours
already
and
the
man
entire
Upon
the
next
encounter
yields
him
ours
he
sits
high
in
all
the
peoples
hearts
And
that
which
would
appear
offense
in
us
His
countenance
like
richest
alchemy
Will
change
to
virtue
and
to
worthiness
Him
and
his
worth
and
our
great
need
of
him
You
have
right
well
conceited
Let
us
go
For
it
is
after
midnight
and
ere
day
We
will
awake
him
and
be
sure
of
him
I
Enter
Brutus
in
his
orchard
What
Lucius
ho
I
cannot
by
the
progress
of
the
stars
Give
guess
how
near
to
day
Lucius
I
say
I
would
it
were
my
fault
to
sleep
so
soundly
When
Lucius
when
Awake
I
say
What
Lucius
Enter
Lucius
Calld
you
my
lord
Get
me
a
taper
in
my
study
Lucius
When
it
is
lighted
come
and
call
me
here
I
will
my
lord
It
must
be
by
his
death
and
for
my
part
I
know
no
personal
cause
to
spurn
at
him
But
for
the
general
He
would
be
crownd
How
that
might
change
his
nature
theres
the
question
It
is
the
bright
day
that
brings
forth
the
adder
And
that
craves
wary
walking
Crown
him
that
And
then
I
grant
we
put
a
sting
in
him
That
at
his
will
he
may
do
danger
with
The
abuse
of
greatness
is
when
it
disjoins
Remorse
from
power
and
to
speak
truth
of
Caesar
I
have
not
known
when
his
affections
swayd
More
than
his
reason
But
tis
a
common
proof
That
lowliness
is
young
ambitions
ladder
Whereto
the
climberupward
turns
his
face
But
when
he
once
attains
the
upmost
round
He
then
unto
the
ladder
turns
his
back
Looks
in
the
clouds
scorning
the
base
degrees
By
which
he
did
ascend
So
Caesar
may
Then
lest
he
may
prevent
And
since
the
quarrel
Will
bear
no
color
for
the
thing
he
is
Fashion
it
thus
that
what
he
is
augmented
Would
run
to
these
and
these
extremities
And
therefore
think
him
as
a
serpents
egg
Which
hatchd
would
as
his
kind
grow
mischievous
And
kill
him
in
the
shell
Reenter
Lucius
The
taper
burneth
in
your
closet
sir
Searching
the
window
for
a
flint
I
found
This
paper
thus
seald
up
and
I
am
sure
It
did
not
lie
there
when
I
went
to
bed
Gives
him
the
letter
Get
you
to
bed
again
it
is
not
day
Is
not
tomorrow
boy
the
ides
of
March
I
know
not
sir
Look
in
the
calendar
and
bring
me
word
I
will
sir
The
exhalations
whizzing
in
the
air
Give
so
much
light
that
I
may
read
by
them
Opens
the
letter
and
reads
Brutus
thou
sleepst
awake
and
see
thyself
Shall
Rome
etc
Speak
strike
redress
Brutus
thou
sleepst
awake
Such
instigations
have
been
often
droppd
Where
I
have
took
them
up
Shall
Rome
etc
Thus
must
I
piece
it
out
Shall
Rome
stand
under
one
mans
awe
What
Rome
My
ancestors
did
from
the
streets
of
Rome
The
Tarquin
drive
when
he
was
calld
a
king
Speak
strike
redress
Am
I
entreated
To
speak
and
strike
Rome
I
make
thee
promise
If
the
redress
will
follow
thou
receivest
Thy
full
petition
at
the
hand
of
Brutus
Reenter
Lucius
Sir
March
is
wasted
fifteen
days
Knocking
within
Tis
good
Go
to
the
gate
somebody
knocks
Since
Cassius
first
did
whet
me
against
Caesar
I
have
not
slept
Between
the
acting
of
a
dreadful
thing
And
the
first
motion
all
the
interim
is
Like
a
phantasma
or
a
hideous
dream
The
genius
and
the
mortal
instruments
Are
then
in
council
and
the
state
of
man
Like
to
a
little
kingdom
suffers
then
The
nature
of
an
insurrection
Reenter
Lucius
Sir
tis
your
brother
Cassius
at
the
door
Who
doth
desire
to
see
you
Is
he
alone
No
sir
there
are
more
with
him
Do
you
know
them
No
sir
their
hats
are
pluckd
about
their
ears
And
half
their
faces
buried
in
their
cloaks
That
by
no
means
I
may
discover
them
By
any
mark
of
favor
Let
em
enter
They
are
the
faction
Conspiracy
Shamest
thou
to
show
thy
dangerous
brow
by
night
When
evils
are
most
free
then
by
day
Where
wilt
thou
find
a
cavern
dark
enough
To
mask
thy
monstrous
visage
Seek
none
Conspiracy
Hide
it
in
smiles
and
affability
For
if
thou
path
thy
native
semblance
on
Not
Erebus
itself
were
dim
enough
To
hide
thee
from
prevention
Enter
the
conspirators
Cassius
Casca
Decius
Cinna
Metellus
Cimber
and
Trebonius
I
think
we
are
too
bold
upon
your
rest
Good
morrow
Brutus
do
we
trouble
you
I
have
been
up
this
hour
awake
all
night
Know
I
these
men
that
come
along
with
you
Yes
every
man
of
them
and
no
man
here
But
honors
you
and
every
one
doth
wish
You
had
but
that
opinion
of
yourself
Which
every
noble
Roman
bears
of
you
This
is
Trebonius
He
is
welcome
hither
This
Decius
Brutus
He
is
welcome
too
This
Casca
this
Cinna
and
this
Metellus
Cimber
They
are
all
welcome
What
watchful
cares
do
interpose
themselves
Betwixt
your
eyes
and
night
Shall
I
entreat
a
word
They
whisper
Here
lies
the
east
Doth
not
the
day
break
here
No
pardon
sir
it
doth
and
yongrey
lines
That
fret
the
clouds
are
messengers
of
day
You
shall
confess
that
you
are
both
deceived
Here
as
I
point
my
sword
the
sun
arises
Which
is
a
great
way
growing
on
the
south
Weighing
the
youthful
season
of
the
year
Some
two
months
hence
up
higher
toward
the
north
He
first
presents
his
fire
and
the
high
east
Stands
as
the
Capitol
directly
here
Give
me
your
hands
all
over
one
by
one
And
let
us
swear
our
resolution
No
not
an
oath
If
not
the
face
of
men
The
sufferance
of
our
souls
the
times
abuse
If
these
be
motives
weak
break
off
betimes
And
every
man
hence
to
his
idle
bed
So
let
highsighted
tyranny
range
on
Till
each
man
drop
by
lottery
But
if
these
As
I
am
sure
they
do
bear
fire
enough
To
kindle
cowards
and
to
steel
with
valor
The
melting
spirits
of
women
then
countrymen
What
need
we
any
spur
but
our
own
cause
To
prick
us
to
redress
What
other
bond
Than
secret
Romans
that
have
spoke
the
word
And
will
not
palter
And
what
other
oath
Than
honesty
to
honesty
engaged
That
this
shall
be
or
we
will
fall
for
it
Swear
priests
and
cowards
and
men
cautelous
Old
feeble
carrions
and
such
suffering
souls
That
welcome
wrongs
unto
bad
causes
swear
Such
creatures
as
men
doubt
but
do
not
stain
The
even
virtue
of
our
enterprise
Nor
the
insuppressive
mettle
of
our
spirits
To
think
that
or
our
cause
or
our
performance
Did
need
an
oath
when
every
drop
of
blood
That
every
Roman
bears
and
nobly
bears
Is
guilty
of
a
several
bastardy
If
he
do
break
the
smallest
particle
Of
any
promise
that
hath
passd
from
him
But
what
of
Cicero
Shall
we
sound
him
I
think
he
will
stand
very
strong
with
us
Let
us
not
leave
him
out
No
by
no
means
let
us
have
him
for
his
silver
hairs
Will
purchase
us
a
good
opinion
And
buy
mens
voices
to
commend
our
deeds
It
shall
be
said
his
judgement
ruled
our
hands
Our
youths
and
wildness
shall
no
whit
appear
But
all
be
buried
in
his
gravity
name
him
not
let
us
not
break
with
him
For
he
will
never
follow
anything
That
other
men
begin
Then
leave
him
out
Indeed
he
is
not
fit
Shall
no
man
else
be
touchd
but
only
Caesar
Decius
well
urged
I
think
it
is
not
meet
Mark
Antony
so
well
beloved
of
Caesar
Should
outlive
Caesar
We
shall
find
of
him
shrewd
contriver
and
you
know
his
means
If
he
improve
them
may
well
stretch
so
far
As
to
annoy
us
all
which
to
prevent
Let
Antony
and
Caesar
fall
together
Our
course
will
seem
too
bloody
Caius
Cassius
To
cut
the
head
off
and
then
hack
the
limbs
Like
wrath
in
death
and
envy
afterwards
For
Antony
is
but
a
limb
of
Caesar
Let
us
be
sacrificers
but
not
butchers
Caius
We
all
stand
up
against
the
spirit
of
Caesar
And
in
the
spirit
of
men
there
is
no
blood
that
we
then
could
come
by
Caesars
spirit
And
not
dismember
Caesar
But
alas
Caesar
must
bleed
for
it
And
gentle
friends
Lets
kill
him
boldly
but
not
wrathfully
Lets
carve
him
as
a
dish
fit
for
the
gods
Not
hew
him
as
a
carcass
fit
for
hounds
And
let
our
hearts
as
subtle
masters
do
Stir
up
their
servants
to
an
act
of
rage
And
after
seem
to
chide
em
This
shall
make
Our
purpose
necessary
and
not
envious
Which
so
appearing
to
the
common
eyes
We
shall
be
calld
purgers
not
murderers
And
for
Mark
Antony
think
not
of
him
For
he
can
do
no
more
than
Caesars
arm
When
Caesars
head
is
off
Yet
I
fear
him
For
in
the
ingrated
love
he
bears
to
Caesar
Alas
good
Cassius
do
not
think
of
him
If
he
love
Caesar
all
that
he
can
do
Is
to
himself
take
thought
and
die
for
Caesar
And
that
were
much
he
should
for
he
is
given
To
sports
to
wildness
and
much
company
There
is
no
fear
in
himlet
him
not
die
For
he
will
live
and
laugh
at
this
hereafter
Clock
strikes
Peace
count
the
clock
The
clock
hath
stricken
three
Tis
time
to
part
But
it
is
doubtful
yet
Whether
Caesar
will
come
forth
today
or
no
For
he
is
superstitious
grown
of
late
Quite
from
the
main
opinion
he
held
once
Of
fantasy
of
dreams
and
ceremonies
It
may
be
these
apparent
prodigies
The
unaccustomd
terror
of
this
night
And
the
persuasion
of
his
augurers
May
hold
him
from
the
Capitol
today
Never
fear
that
If
he
be
so
resolved
I
can
oersway
him
for
he
loves
to
hear
That
unicorns
may
be
betrayd
with
trees
And
bears
with
glasses
elephants
with
holes
Lions
with
toils
and
men
with
flatterers
But
when
I
tell
him
he
hates
flatterers
He
says
he
does
being
then
most
flattered
Let
me
work
For
I
can
give
his
humor
the
true
bent
And
I
will
bring
him
to
the
Capitol
Nay
we
will
all
of
us
be
there
to
fetch
him
By
the
eighth
hour
Is
that
the
utter
most
Be
that
the
uttermost
and
fail
not
then
Caius
Ligarius
doth
bear
Caesar
hard
Who
rated
him
for
speaking
well
of
Pompey
I
wonder
none
of
you
have
thought
of
him
Now
good
Metellus
go
along
by
him
He
loves
me
well
and
I
have
given
him
reasons
Send
him
but
hither
and
Ill
fashion
him
The
morning
comes
upon
s
Well
leave
you
Brutus
And
friends
disperse
yourselves
but
all
remember
What
you
have
said
and
show
yourselves
true
Romans
Good
gentlemen
look
fresh
and
merrily
Let
not
our
looks
put
on
our
purposes
But
bear
it
as
our
Roman
actors
do
With
untired
spirits
and
formal
constancy
And
so
good
morrow
to
you
every
one
Boy
Lucius
Fast
asleep
It
is
no
matter
Enjoy
the
honeyheavy
dew
of
slumber
Thou
hast
no
figures
nor
no
fantasies
Which
busy
care
draws
in
the
brains
of
men
Therefore
thou
sleepst
so
sound
Enter
Portia
Brutus
my
lord
Portia
what
mean
you
Wherefore
rise
you
now
It
is
not
for
your
health
thus
to
commit
Your
weak
condition
to
the
raw
cold
morning
Nor
for
yours
neither
have
ungently
Brutus
Stole
from
my
bed
and
yesternight
at
supper
You
suddenly
arose
and
walkd
about
Musing
and
sighing
with
your
arms
across
And
when
I
askd
you
what
the
matter
was
You
stared
upon
me
with
ungentle
looks
I
urged
you
further
then
you
scratchd
your
head
And
too
impatiently
stampd
with
your
foot
Yet
I
insisted
yet
you
answerd
not
But
with
an
angry
waiter
of
your
hand
Gave
sign
for
me
to
leave
you
So
I
did
Fearing
to
strengthen
that
impatience
Which
seemd
too
much
enkindled
and
withal
Hoping
it
was
but
an
effect
of
humor
Which
sometime
hath
his
hour
with
every
man
It
will
not
let
you
eat
nor
talk
nor
sleep
And
could
it
work
so
much
upon
your
shape
As
it
hath
much
prevaild
on
your
condition
I
should
not
know
you
Brutus
Dear
my
lord
Make
me
acquainted
with
your
cause
of
grief
I
am
not
well
in
health
and
that
is
all
Brutus
is
wise
and
were
he
not
in
health
He
would
embrace
the
means
to
come
by
it
Why
so
I
do
Good
Portia
go
to
bed
Is
Brutus
sick
and
is
it
physical
To
walk
unbraced
and
suck
up
the
humors
Of
the
dank
morning
What
is
Brutus
sick
And
will
he
steal
out
of
his
wholesome
bed
To
dare
the
vile
contagion
of
the
night
And
tempt
the
rheumy
and
unpurged
air
To
add
unto
his
sickness
No
my
Brutus
You
have
some
sick
offense
within
your
mind
Which
by
the
right
and
virtue
of
my
place
I
ought
to
know
of
and
upon
my
knees
I
charm
you
by
my
once
commended
beauty
By
all
your
vows
of
love
and
that
great
vow
Which
did
incorporate
and
make
us
one
That
you
unfold
to
me
yourself
your
half
Why
you
are
heavy
and
what
men
tonight
Have
had
resort
to
you
for
here
have
been
Some
six
or
seven
who
did
hide
their
faces
Even
from
darkness
Kneel
not
gentle
Portia
I
should
not
need
if
you
were
gentle
Brutus
Within
the
bond
of
marriage
tell
me
Brutus
Is
it
excepted
I
should
know
no
secrets
That
appertain
to
you
Am
I
yourself
But
as
it
were
in
sort
or
limitation
To
keep
with
you
at
meals
comfort
your
bed
And
talk
to
you
sometimes
Dwell
I
but
in
the
suburbs
Of
your
good
pleasure
If
it
be
no
more
Portia
is
Brutus
harlot
not
his
wife
You
are
my
true
and
honorable
wife
As
dear
to
me
as
are
the
ruddy
drops
That
visit
my
sad
heart
If
this
were
true
then
should
I
know
this
secret
I
grant
I
am
a
woman
but
withal
woman
that
Lord
Brutus
took
to
wife
I
grant
I
am
a
woman
but
withal
woman
well
reputed
Catos
daughter
Think
you
I
am
no
stronger
than
my
sex
Being
so
fatherd
and
so
husbanded
Tell
me
your
counsels
I
will
not
disclose
em
I
have
made
strong
proof
of
my
constancy
Giving
myself
a
voluntary
wound
Here
in
the
thigh
Can
I
bear
that
with
patience
And
not
my
husbands
secrets
ye
gods
Render
me
worthy
of
this
noble
wife
Knocking
within
Hark
hark
one
knocks
Portia
go
in
awhile
And
by
and
by
thy
bosom
shall
partake
The
secrets
of
my
heart
All
my
engagements
I
will
construe
to
thee
All
the
charactery
of
my
sad
brows
Leave
me
with
haste
Reenter
Lucius
with
Ligarius
Here
is
a
sick
man
that
would
speak
with
you
Caius
Ligarius
that
Metellus
spake
of
Boy
stand
aside
Caius
Ligarius
how
Vouchsafe
good
morrow
from
a
feeble
tongue
what
a
time
have
you
chose
out
brave
Caius
To
wear
a
kerchief
Would
you
were
not
sick
I
am
not
sick
if
Brutus
have
in
hand
Any
exploit
worthy
the
name
of
honor
Such
an
exploit
have
I
in
hand
Ligarius
Had
you
a
healthful
ear
to
hear
of
it
By
all
the
gods
that
Romans
bow
before
I
here
discard
my
sickness
Soul
of
Rome
Brave
son
derived
from
honorable
loins
Thou
like
an
exorcist
hast
conjured
up
My
mortified
spirit
Now
bid
me
run
And
I
will
strive
with
things
impossible
Yea
get
the
better
of
them
Whats
to
do
piece
of
work
that
will
make
sick
men
whole
But
are
not
some
whole
that
we
must
make
sick
That
must
we
also
What
it
is
my
Caius
I
shall
unfold
to
thee
as
we
are
going
To
whom
it
must
be
done
Set
on
your
foot
And
with
a
heart
newfired
I
follow
you
To
do
I
know
not
what
but
it
sufficeth
That
Brutus
leads
me
on
Follow
me
then
street
near
the
Capitol
Enter
Artemidorus
reading
paper
Caesar
beware
of
Brutus
take
heed
of
Cassius
come
not
near
Casca
have
an
eye
to
Cinna
trust
not
Trebonius
mark
well
Metellus
Cimber
Decius
Brutus
loves
thee
not
thou
hast
wronged
Caius
Ligarius
There
is
but
one
mind
in
all
these
men
and
it
is
bent
against
Caesar
If
thou
beest
not
immortal
look
about
you
Security
gives
way
to
conspiracy
The
mighty
gods
defend
thee
Thy
lover
Artemidorus
Here
will
I
stand
till
Caesar
pass
along
And
as
a
suitor
will
I
give
him
this
My
heart
laments
that
virtue
cannot
live
Out
of
the
teeth
of
emulation
If
thou
read
this
Caesar
thou
mayest
live
If
not
the
Fates
with
traitors
do
contrive
We
will
be
satisfied
Let
us
be
satisfied
Then
follow
me
and
give
me
audience
friends
Cassius
go
you
into
the
other
street
And
part
the
numbers
Those
that
will
hear
me
speak
let
em
stay
here
Those
that
will
follow
Cassius
go
with
him
And
public
reasons
shall
be
rendered
Of
Caesars
death
I
will
hear
Brutus
speak
I
will
hear
Cassius
and
compare
their
reasons
When
severally
we
hear
them
rendered
Brutus
goes
into
the
pulpit
The
noble
Brutus
is
ascended
Silence
Be
patient
till
the
last
Romans
countrymen
and
lovers
Hear
me
for
my
cause
and
be
silent
that
you
may
hear
Believe
me
for
mine
honor
and
have
respect
to
mine
honor
that
you
may
believe
Censure
me
in
your
wisdom
and
awake
your
senses
that
you
may
the
better
judge
If
there
be
any
in
this
assembly
any
dear
friend
of
Caesars
to
him
I
say
that
Brutus
love
to
Caesar
was
no
less
than
his
If
then
that
friend
demand
why
Brutus
rose
against
Caesar
this
is
my
answer
Not
that
I
loved
Caesar
less
but
that
I
loved
Rome
more
Had
you
rather
Caesar
were
living
and
die
all
slaves
than
that
Caesar
were
dead
to
live
all
freemen
As
Caesar
loved
me
I
weep
for
him
as
he
was
fortunate
I
rejoice
at
it
as
he
was
valiant
I
honor
him
but
as
he
was
ambitious
I
slew
him
There
is
tears
for
his
love
joy
for
his
fortune
honor
for
his
valor
and
death
for
his
ambition
Who
is
here
so
base
that
would
be
a
bondman
If
any
speak
for
him
have
I
offended
Who
is
here
so
rude
that
would
not
be
a
Roman
If
any
speak
for
him
have
I
offended
Who
is
here
so
vile
that
will
not
love
his
country
If
any
speak
for
him
have
I
offended
I
pause
for
a
reply
None
Brutus
none
Then
none
have
I
offended
I
have
done
no
more
to
Caesar
than
you
shall
do
to
Brutus
The
question
of
his
death
is
enrolled
in
the
Capitol
his
glory
not
extenuated
wherein
he
was
worthy
nor
his
offenses
enforced
for
which
he
suffered
death
Enter
Antony
and
others
with
Caesars
body
Here
comes
his
body
mourned
by
Mark
Antony
who
though
he
had
no
hand
in
his
death
shall
receive
the
benefit
of
his
dying
a
place
in
the
commonwealth
as
which
of
you
shall
not
With
this
I
depart
that
as
I
slew
my
best
lover
for
the
good
of
Rome
I
have
the
same
dagger
for
myself
when
it
shall
please
my
country
to
need
my
death
Live
Brutus
live
live
Bring
him
with
triumph
home
unto
his
house
Give
him
a
statue
with
his
ancestors
Let
him
be
Caesar
Caesars
better
parts
Shall
be
crownd
in
Brutus
Well
bring
him
to
his
house
with
shouts
and
clamors
My
countrymen
Peace
Silence
Brutus
speaks
Peace
ho
Good
countrymen
let
me
depart
alone
And
for
my
sake
stay
here
with
Antony
Do
grace
to
Caesars
corse
and
grace
his
speech
Tending
to
Caesars
glories
which
Mark
Antony
By
our
permission
is
allowd
to
make
I
do
entreat
you
not
a
man
depart
Save
I
alone
till
Antony
have
spoke
Stay
ho
and
let
us
hear
Mark
Antony
Let
him
go
up
into
the
public
chair
Well
hear
him
Noble
Antony
go
up
For
Brutus
sake
I
am
beholding
to
you
Goes
into
the
pulpit
What
does
he
say
of
Brutus
He
says
for
Brutus
sake
He
finds
himself
beholding
to
us
all
Twere
best
he
speak
no
harm
of
Brutus
here
This
Caesar
was
a
tyrant
Nay
thats
certain
We
are
blest
that
Rome
is
rid
of
him
Peace
Let
us
hear
what
Antony
can
say
You
gentle
Romans
Peace
ho
Let
us
hear
him
Friends
Romans
countrymen
lend
me
your
ears
I
come
to
bury
Caesar
not
to
praise
him
The
evil
that
men
do
lives
after
them
The
good
is
oft
interred
with
their
bones
So
let
it
be
with
Caesar
The
noble
Brutus
Hath
told
you
Caesar
was
ambitious
If
it
were
so
it
was
a
grievous
fault
And
grievously
hath
Caesar
answerd
it
Here
under
leave
of
Brutus
and
the
rest
For
Brutus
is
an
honorable
man
So
are
they
all
all
honorable
men
Come
I
to
speak
in
Caesars
funeral
He
was
my
friend
faithful
and
just
to
me
But
Brutus
says
he
was
ambitious
And
Brutus
is
an
honorable
man
He
hath
brought
many
captives
home
to
Rome
Whose
ransoms
did
the
general
coffers
fill
Did
this
in
Caesar
seem
ambitious
When
that
the
poor
have
cried
Caesar
hath
wept
Ambition
should
be
made
of
sterner
stuff
Yet
Brutus
says
he
was
ambitious
And
Brutus
is
an
honorable
man
You
all
did
see
that
on
the
Lupercal
I
thrice
presented
him
a
kingly
crown
Which
he
did
thrice
refuse
Was
this
ambition
Yet
Brutus
says
he
was
ambitious
And
sure
he
is
an
honorable
man
I
speak
not
to
disprove
what
Brutus
spoke
But
here
I
am
to
speak
what
I
do
know
You
all
did
love
him
once
not
without
cause
What
cause
withholds
you
then
to
mourn
for
him
judgement
thou
art
fled
to
brutish
beasts
And
men
have
lost
their
reason
Bear
with
me
My
heart
is
in
the
coffin
there
with
Caesar
And
I
must
pause
till
it
come
back
to
me
Methinks
there
is
much
reason
in
his
sayings
If
thou
consider
rightly
of
the
matter
Caesar
has
had
great
wrong
Has
he
masters
I
fear
there
will
a
worse
come
in
his
place
Markd
ye
his
words
He
would
not
take
the
crown
Therefore
tis
certain
he
was
not
ambitious
If
it
be
found
so
some
will
dear
abide
it
Poor
soul
his
eyes
are
red
as
fire
with
weeping
Theres
not
a
nobler
man
in
Rome
than
Antony
Now
mark
him
he
begins
again
to
speak
But
yesterday
the
word
of
Caesar
might
Have
stood
against
the
world
Now
lies
he
there
And
none
so
poor
to
do
him
reverence
masters
If
I
were
disposed
to
stir
Your
hearts
and
minds
to
mutiny
and
rage
I
should
do
Brutus
wrong
and
Cassius
wrong
Who
you
all
know
are
honorable
men
I
will
not
do
them
wrong
I
rather
choose
To
wrong
the
dead
to
wrong
myself
and
you
Than
I
will
wrong
such
honorable
men
But
heres
a
parchment
with
the
seal
of
Caesar
I
found
it
in
his
closet
tis
his
will
Let
but
the
commons
hear
this
testament
Which
pardon
me
I
do
not
mean
to
read
And
they
would
go
and
kiss
dead
Caesars
wounds
And
dip
their
napkins
in
his
sacred
blood
Yea
beg
a
hair
of
him
for
memory
And
dying
mention
it
within
their
wills
Bequeathing
it
as
a
rich
legacy
Unto
their
issue
Well
hear
the
will
Read
it
Mark
Antony
The
will
the
will
We
will
hear
Caesars
will
Have
patience
gentle
friends
I
must
not
read
it
It
is
not
meet
you
know
how
Caesar
loved
you
You
are
not
wood
you
are
not
stones
but
men
And
being
men
hearing
the
will
of
Caesar
It
will
inflame
you
it
will
make
you
mad
Tis
good
you
know
not
that
you
are
his
heirs
For
if
you
should
what
would
come
of
it
Read
the
will
well
hear
it
Antony
You
shall
read
us
the
will
Caesars
will
Will
you
be
patient
Will
you
stay
awhile
I
have
oershot
myself
to
tell
you
of
it
I
fear
I
wrong
the
honorable
men
Whose
daggers
have
stabbd
Caesar
I
do
fear
it
They
were
traitors
Honorable
men
The
will
The
testament
They
were
villains
murtherers
The
will
Read
the
will
You
will
compel
me
then
to
read
the
will
Then
make
a
ring
about
the
corse
of
Caesar
And
let
me
show
you
him
that
made
the
will
Shall
I
descend
And
will
you
give
me
leave
Come
down
Descend
He
comes
down
from
the
pulpit
You
shall
have
leave
ring
stand
round
Stand
from
the
hearse

Room

Antony
most
noble
Antony
Nay

so
upon
me
stand
far
off
Stand
back
room
bear
back
If
you
have
tears
prepare
to
shed
them
now
You
all
do
know
this
mantle
I
remember
The
first
time
ever
Caesar
put
it
on
Twas
on
a
summers
evening
in
his
tent
That
day
he
overcame
the
Nervii
Look
in
this
place
ran
Cassius
dagger
through
See
what
a
rent
the
envious
Casca
made
Through
this
the
wellbeloved
Brutus
stabbd
And
as
he
pluckd
his
cursed
steel
away
Mark
how
the
blood
of
Caesar
followd
it
As
rushing
out
of
doors
to
be
resolved
If
Brutus
so
unkindly
knockd
or
no
For
Brutus
as
you
know
was
Caesars
angel
Judge
you
gods
how
dearly
Caesar
loved
him
This
was
the
most
unkindest
cut
of
all
For
when
the
noble
Caesar
saw
him
stab
Ingratitude
more
strong
than
traitors
arms
Quite
vanquishd
him
Then
burst
his
mighty
heart
And
in
his
mantle
muffling
up
his
face
Even
at
the
base
of
Pompeys
statue
Which
all
the
while
ran
blood
great
Caesar
fell
what
a
fall
was
there
my
countrymen
Then
I
and
you
and
all
of
us
fell
down
Whilst
bloody
treason
flourishd
over
us
now
you
weep
and
I
perceive
you
feel
The
dint
of
pity
These
are
gracious
drops
Kind
souls
what
weep
you
when
you
but
behold
Our
Caesars
vesture
wounded
Look
you
here
Here
is
himself
marrd
as
you
see
with
traitors
piteous
spectacle
noble
Caesar
woeful
day
traitors
villains
most
bloody
sight
We
will
be
revenged
Revenge
About
Seek
Burn
Fire
Kill
Slay
Let
not
a
traitor
live
Stay
countrymen
Peace
there
Hear
the
noble
Antony
Well
hear
him
well
follow
him
well
die
with
him
Good
friends
sweet
friends
let
me
not
stir
you
up
To
such
a
sudden
flood
of
mutiny
They
that
have
done
this
deed
are
honorable
What
private
griefs
they
have
alas
I
know
not
That
made
them
do
it
They
are
wise
and
honorable
And
will
no
doubt
with
reasons
answer
you
I
come
not
friends
to
steal
away
your
hearts
I
am
no
orator
as
Brutus
is
But
as
you
know
me
all
a
plain
blunt
man
That
love
my
friend
and
that
they
know
full
well
That
gave
me
public
leave
to
speak
of
him
For
I
have
neither
wit
nor
words
nor
worth
Action
nor
utterance
nor
the
power
of
speech
To
stir
mens
blood
I
only
speak
right
on
I
tell
you
that
which
you
yourselves
do
know
Show
you
sweet
Caesars
wounds
poor
dumb
mouths
And
bid
them
speak
for
me
But
were
I
Brutus
And
Brutus
Antony
there
were
an
Antony
Would
ruffle
up
your
spirits
and
put
a
tongue
In
every
wound
of
Caesar
that
should
move
The
stones
of
Rome
to
rise
and
mutiny
Well
mutiny
Well
burn
the
house
of
Brutus
Away
then
Come
seek
the
conspirators
Yet
hear
me
countrymen
yet
hear
me
speak
Peace
ho
Hear
Antony
most
noble
Antony
Why
friends
you
go
to
do
you
know
not
what
Wherein
hath
Caesar
thus
deserved
your
loves
Alas
you
know
not
I
must
tell
you
then
You
have
forgot
the
will
I
told
you
of
Most
true
the
will
Lets
stay
and
hear
the
will
Here
is
the
will
and
under
Caesars
seal
To
every
Roman
citizen
he
gives
To
every
several
man
seventyfive
drachmas
Most
noble
Caesar
Well
revenge
his
death
royal
Caesar
Hear
me
with
patience
Peace
ho
Moreover
he
hath
left
you
all
his
walks
His
private
arbors
and
newplanted
orchards
On
this
side
Tiber
he
hath
left
them
you
And
to
your
heirs
forever
common
pleasures
To
walk
abroad
and
recreate
yourselves
Here
was
a
Caesar
When
comes
such
another
Never
never
Come
away
away
Well
burn
his
body
in
the
holy
place
And
with
the
brands
fire
the
traitors
houses
Take
up
the
body
Go
fetch
fire
Pluck
down
benches
Pluck
down
forms
windows
anything
Now
let
it
work
Mischief
thou
art
afoot
Take
thou
what
course
thou
wilt
Enter
a
Servant
How
now
fellow
Sir
Octavius
is
already
come
to
Rome
Where
is
he
He
and
Lepidus
are
at
Caesars
house
And
thither
will
I
straight
to
visit
him
He
comes
upon
a
wish
Fortune
is
merry
And
in
this
mood
will
give
us
anything
I
heard
him
say
Brutus
and
Cassius
Are
rid
like
madmen
through
the
gates
of
Rome
Be
like
they
had
some
notice
of
the
people
How
I
had
moved
them
Bring
me
to
Octavius
Stand
ho
Give
the
word
ho
and
stand
What
now
Lucilius
is
Cassius
near
He
is
at
hand
and
Pindarus
is
come
To
do
you
salutation
from
his
master
He
greets
me
well
Your
master
Pindarus
In
his
own
change
or
by
ill
officers
Hath
given
me
some
worthy
cause
to
wish
Things
done
undone
but
if
he
be
at
hand
I
shall
be
satisfied
I
do
not
doubt
But
that
my
noble
master
will
appear
Such
as
he
is
full
of
regard
and
honor
He
is
not
doubted
word
Lucilius
How
he
received
you
Let
me
be
resolved
With
courtesy
and
with
respect
enough
But
not
with
such
familiar
instances
Nor
with
such
free
and
friendly
conference
As
he
hath
used
of
old
Thou
hast
described
hot
friend
cooling
Ever
note
Lucilius
When
love
begins
to
sicken
and
decay
It
useth
an
enforced
ceremony
There
are
no
tricks
in
plain
and
simple
faith
But
hollow
men
like
horses
hot
at
hand
Make
gallant
show
and
promise
of
their
mettle
But
when
they
should
endure
the
bloody
spur
They
fall
their
crests
and
like
deceitful
jades
Sink
in
the
trial
Comes
his
army
on
They
meant
his
night
in
Sard
is
to
be
quarterd
The
greater
part
the
horse
in
general
Are
come
with
Cassius
Low
march
within
Hark
he
is
arrived
March
gently
on
to
meet
him
Enter
Cassius
and
his
Powers
Stand
ho
Stand
ho
Speak
the
word
along
Stand
Stand
Stand
Most
noble
brother
you
have
done
me
wrong
Judge
me
you
gods
Wrong
I
mine
enemies
And
if
not
so
how
should
I
wrong
a
brother
Brutus
this
sober
form
of
yours
hides
wrongs
And
when
you
do
them
Cassius
be
content
Speak
your
griefs
softly
I
do
know
you
well
Before
the
eyes
of
both
our
armies
here
Which
should
perceive
nothing
but
love
from
us
Let
us
not
wrangle
Bid
them
move
away
Then
in
my
tent
Cassius
enlarge
your
griefs
And
I
will
give
you
audience
Pindarus
Bid
our
commanders
lead
their
charges
off
little
from
this
ground
Lucilius
do
you
the
like
and
let
no
man
Come
to
our
tent
till
we
have
done
our
conference
Let
Lucius
and
Titinius
guard
our
door
Ride
ride
Messala
ride
and
give
these
bills
Unto
the
legions
on
the
other
side
Loud
alarum
Let
them
set
on
at
once
for
I
perceive
But
cold
demeanor
in
Octavias
wing
And
sudden
push
gives
them
the
overthrow
Ride
ride
Messala
Let
them
all
come
down
Yet
countrymen
yet
hold
up
your
heads
What
bastard
doth
not
Who
will
go
with
me
I
will
proclaim
my
name
about
the
field
I
am
the
son
of
Marcus
Cato
ho
foe
to
tyrants
and
my
countrys
friend
I
am
the
son
of
Marcus
Cato
ho
And
I
am
Brutus
Marcus
Brutus
I
Brutus
my
countrys
friend
know
me
for
Brutus
young
and
noble
Cato
art
thou
down
Why
now
thou
diest
as
bravely
as
Titinius
And
mayst
be
honord
being
Catos
son
Yield
or
thou
diest
Only
I
yield
to
die
Offers
money
There
is
so
much
that
thou
wilt
kill
me
straight
Kill
Brutus
and
be
honord
in
his
death
We
must
not
noble
prisoner
Room
ho
Tell
Antony
Brutus

taen
Ill
tell
the
news
Here
comes
the
general
Enter
Antony
Brutus
is
taen
Brutus
is
taen
my
lord
Where
is
he
Safe
Antony
Brutus
is
safe
enough
I
dare
assure
thee
that
no
enemy
Shall
ever
take
alive
the
noble
Brutus
The
gods
defend
him
from
so
great
a
shame
When
you
do
find
him
or
alive
or
dead
He
will
be
found
like
Brutus
like
himself
This
is
not
Brutus
friend
but
I
assure
you
prize
no
less
in
worth
Keep
this
man
safe
Give
him
all
kindness
I
had
rather
have
Such
men
my
friends
than
enemies
Go
on
And
see
wheer
Brutus
be
alive
or
dead
And
bring
us
word
unto
Octavius
tent
How
everything
is
chanced
I
I
Navarre
The
Kings
park
Enter
the
King
and
Let
fame
that
all
hunt
after
in
their
lives
Live
registred
upon
our
brazen
tombs
And
then
grace
us
in
the
disgrace
of
death
When
spite
of
cormorant
devouring
Time
Th
endeavour
of
this
present
breath
may
buy
That
honour
which
shall
bate
his
scythes
keen
edge
And
make
us
heirs
of
all
eternity
Therefore
brave
conquerors
for
so
you
are
That
war
against
your
own
affections
And
the
huge
army
of
the
worlds
desires
Our
late
edict
shall
strongly
stand
in
force
Navarre
shall
be
the
wonder
of
the
world
Our
court
shall
be
a
little
Academe
Still
and
contemplative
in
living
art
You
three
Berowne
Dumain
and
Longaville
Have
sworn
for
three
years
term
to
live
with
me
My
fellowscholars
and
to
keep
those
statutes
That
are
recorded
in
this
schedule
here
Your
oaths
are
passd
and
now
subscribe
your
names
That
his
own
hand
may
strike
his
honour
down
That
violates
the
smallest
branch
herein
If
you
are
armd
to
do
as
sworn
to
do
Subscribe
to
your
deep
oaths
and
keep
it
too
I
am
resolvd
tis
but
a
three
years
fast
The
mind
shall
banquet
though
the
body
pine
Fat
paunches
have
lean
pates
and
dainty
bits
Make
rich
the
ribs
but
bankrupt
quite
the
wits
My
loving
lord
Dumain
is
mortified
The
grosser
manner
of
these
worlds
delights
He
throws
upon
the
gross
worlds
baser
slaves
To
love
to
wealth
to
pomp
I
pine
and
die
With
all
these
living
in
philosophy
I
can
but
say
their
protestation
over
So
much
dear
liege
I
have
already
sworn
That
is
to
live
and
study
here
three
years
But
there
are
other
strict
observances
As
not
to
see
a
woman
in
that
term
Which
I
hope
well
is
not
enrolled
there
And
one
day
in
a
week
to
touch
no
food
And
but
one
meal
on
every
day
beside
The
which
I
hope
is
not
enrolled
there
And
then
to
sleep
but
three
hours
in
the
night
And
not
be
seen
to
wink
of
all
the
day
When
I
was
wont
to
think
no
harm
all
night
And
make
a
dark
night
too
of
half
the
day
Which
I
hope
well
is
not
enrolled
there
these
are
barren
tasks
too
hard
to
keep
Not
to
see
ladies
study
fast
not
sleep
Your
oath
is
passd
to
pass
away
from
these
Let
me
say
no
my
liege
an
if
you
please
I
only
swore
to
study
with
your
Grace
And
stay
here
in
your
court
for
three
years
space
You
swore
to
that
Berowne
and
to
the
rest
By
yea
and
nay
sir
then
I
swore
in
jest
What
is
the
end
of
study
let
me
know
Why
that
to
know
which
else
we
should
not
know
Things
hid
and
barrd
you
mean
from
common
sense
Ay
that
is
studys
godlike
recompense
Come
on
then
I
will
swear
to
study
so
To
know
the
thing
I
am
forbid
to
know
As
thus
to
study
where
I
well
may
dine
When
I
to
feast
expressly
am
forbid
Or
study
where
to
meet
some
mistress
fine
When
mistresses
from
common
sense
are
hid
Or
having
sworn
too
hardakeeping
oath
Study
to
break
it
and
not
break
my
troth
If
studys
gain
be
thus
and
this
be
so
Study
knows
that
which
yet
it
doth
not
know
Swear
me
to
this
and
I
will
neer
say
no
These
be
the
stops
that
hinder
study
quite
And
train
our
intellects
to
vain
delight
Why
all
delights
are
vain
but
that
most
vain
Which
with
pain
purchasd
doth
inherit
pain
As
painfully
to
pore
upon
a
book
To
seek
the
light
of
truth
while
truth
the
while
Doth
falsely
blind
the
eyesight
of
his
look
Light
seeking
light
doth
light
of
light
beguile
So
ere
you
find
where
light
in
darkness
lies
Your
light
grows
dark
by
losing
of
your
eyes
Study
me
how
to
please
the
eye
indeed
By
fixing
it
upon
a
fairer
eye
Who
dazzling
so
that
eye
shall
be
his
heed
And
give
him
light
that
it
was
blinded
by
Study
is
like
the
heavens
glorious
sun
That
will
not
be
deepsearchd
with
saucy
looks
Small
have
continual
plodders
ever
won
Save
base
authority
from
others
books
These
earthly
godfathers
of
heavens
lights
That
give
a
name
to
every
fixed
star
Have
no
more
profit
of
their
shining
nights
Than
those
that
walk
and
wot
not
what
they
are
Too
much
to
know
is
to
know
nought
but
fame
And
every
godfather
can
give
a
name
How
well
hes
read
to
reason
against
reading
Proceeded
well
to
stop
all
good
proceeding
He
weeds
the
corn
and
still
lets
grow
the
weeding
The
spring
is
near
when
green
geese
are
abreeding
How
follows
that
Fit
in
his
place
and
time
In
reason
nothing
Something
then
in
rhyme
Berowne
is
like
an
envious
sneaping
frost
That
bites
the
firstborn
infants
of
the
spring
Well
say
I
am
why
should
proud
summer
boast
Before
the
birds
have
any
cause
to
sing
Why
should
I
joy
in
any
abortive
birth
At
Christmas
I
no
more
desire
a
rose
Than
wish
a
snow
in
Mays
newfangled
shows
But
like
of
each
thing
that
in
season
grows
So
you
to
study
now
it
is
too
late
Climb
oer
the
house
to
unlock
the
little
gate
Well
sit
out
go
home
Berowne
adieu
No
my
good
lord
I
have
sworn
to
stay
with
you
And
though
I
have
for
barbarism
spoke
more
Than
for
that
angel
knowledge
you
can
say
Yet
confident
Ill
keep
what
I
have
swore
And
bide
the
penance
of
each
three
years
day
Give
me
the
paper
let
me
read
the
same
And
to
the
strictest
decrees
Ill
write
my
name
How
well
this
yielding
rescues
thee
from
shame
Reads
Item
That
no
woman
shall
come
within
a
mile
of
my
court
Hath
this
been
proclaimed
Four
days
ago
Lets
see
the
penalty
Reads
on
pain
of
losing
her
tongue
Who
devisd
this
penalty
Marry
that
did
I
Sweet
lord
and
why
To
fright
them
hence
with
that
dread
penalty
dangerous
law
against
gentility
Reads
Item
If
any
man
be
seen
to
talk
with
a
woman
within
the
term
of
three
years
he
shall
endure
such
public
shame
as
the
rest
of
the
court
can
possibly
devise
This
article
my
liege
yourself
must
break
For
well
you
know
here
comes
in
embassy
The
French
kings
daughter
with
yourself
to
speak
mild
of
grace
and
complete
majesty
About
surrender
up
of
Aquitaine
To
her
decrepit
sick
and
bedrid
father
Therefore
this
article
is
made
in
vain
Or
vainly
comes
th
admired
princess
hither
What
say
you
lords
Why
this
was
quite
forgot
So
study
evermore
is
overshot
While
it
doth
study
to
have
what
it
would
It
doth
forget
to
do
the
thing
it
should
And
when
it
hath
the
thing
it
hunteth
most
Tis
won
as
towns
with
fire
so
won
so
lost
We
must
of
force
dispense
with
this
decree
She
must
lie
here
on
mere
necessity
Necessity
will
make
us
all
forsworn
Three
thousand
times
within
this
three
years
space
For
every
man
with
his
affects
is
born
Not
by
might
mastred
but
by
special
grace
If
I
break
faith
this
word
shall
speak
for
me
I
am
forsworn
on
mere
necessity
So
to
the
laws
at
large
I
write
my
name
Subscribes
And
he
that
breaks
them
in
the
least
degree
Stands
in
attainder
of
eternal
shame
Suggestions
are
to
other
as
to
me
But
I
believe
although
I
seem
so
loath
I
am
the
last
that
will
last
keep
his
oath
But
is
there
no
quick
recreation
granted
Ay
that
there
is
Our
court
you
know
is
haunted
With
a
refined
traveller
of
Spain
man
in
all
the
worlds
new
fashion
planted
That
hath
a
mint
of
phrases
in
his
brain
One
who
the
music
of
his
own
vain
tongue
Doth
ravish
like
enchanting
harmony
man
of
complements
whom
right
and
wrong
Have
chose
as
umpire
of
their
mutiny
This
child
of
fancy
that
Armado
hight
For
interim
to
our
studies
shall
relate
In
highborn
words
the
worth
of
many
a
knight
From
tawny
Spain
lost
in
the
worlds
debate
How
you
delight
my
lords
I
know
not
I
But
I
protest
I
love
to
hear
him
lie
And
I
will
use
him
for
my
minstrelsy
Armado
is
a
most
illustrious
wight
man
of
firenew
words
fashions
own
knight
Costard
the
swain
and
he
shall
be
our
sport
And
so
to
study
three
years
is
but
short
Enter
a
constable
with
a
letter
and
Which
is
the
Dukes
own
person
This
fellow
What
wouldst
I
myself
reprehend
his
own
person
for
I
am
his
Graces
farborough
but
I
would
see
his
own
person
in
flesh
and
blood
This
is
he
Signior
Arme
Arme
commends
you
Theres
villainy
abroad
this
letter
will
tell
you
more
Sir
the
contempts
thereof
are
as
touching
me
letter
from
the
magnificent
Armado
How
low
soever
the
matter
I
hope
in
God
for
high
words
high
hope
for
a
low
heaven
God
grant
us
patience
To
hear
or
forbear
hearing
To
hear
meekly
sir
and
to
laugh
moderately
or
to
forbear
both
Well
sir
be
it
as
the
style
shall
give
us
cause
to
climb
in
the
merriness
The
matter
is
to
me
sir
as
concerning
Jaquenetta
The
manner
of
it
is
I
was
taken
with
the
manner
In
what
manner
In
manner
and
form
following
sir
all
those

I
was
seen
with
her
in
the
manorhouse
sitting
with
her
upon
the
form
and
taken
following
her
into
the
park
which
put
together
is
in
manner
and
form
following
Now
sir
for
the
manner
it
is
the
manner
of
a
man
to
speak
to
a
woman
For
the
form
in
some
form
For
the
following
sir
As
it
shall
follow
in
my
correction
and
God
defend
the
right
Will
you
hear
this
letter
with
attention
As
we
would
hear
an
oracle
Such
is
the
simplicity
of
man
to
hearken
after
the
flesh
Reads
Great
deputy

welkins
vicegerent
and
sole
dominator
of
Navarre
my

and

fostring
patron
Not
a
word
of
Costard
yet
Reads
So
it
is
It
may
be
so
but
if
he
say
it
is
so
he
is
in
telling
true
but
so
Peace
Be
to
me
and
every
man
that
dares
not
fight
No
words
Of
other
mens
secrets
I
beseech
you
Reads
So
it
is
besieged
with
sablecoloured
melancholy
I
did
commend
the
black
oppressing
humour
to
the
most
wholesome
physic
of
thy
healthgiving
air
and
as
I
am
a
gentleman
betook
myself
to
walk
The
time
When
About
the
sixth
hour
when
beasts
most
graze
birds
best
peck
and
men
sit
down
to
that
nourishment
which
is
called
supper
So
much
for
the
time
When
Now
for
the
ground
Which
which
I
mean
I
upon
it
is
ycleped
thy
park
Then
for
the
place
Where
where
I
mean
I
did
encounter
that
obscene
and
most
prepostrous
event
that
draweth
from
my
snowwhite
pen
the
eboncoloured
ink
which
here
thou
viewest
beholdest
surveyest
or
seest
But
to
the
place
Where
It
standeth
northnortheast
and
by
east
from
the
west
corner
of
thy
curiousknotted
garden
There
did
I
see
that
lowspirited
swain
that
base
minnow
of
thy
mirth
Me
that
unlettered
smallknowing
soul
Me
that
shallow
vassal
Still
me
which
as
I
remember
hight
Costard
me
sorted
and
consorted
contrary
to
thy
established
proclaimed
edict
and
continent
canon
which
with
with
but
with
this
I
passion
to
say
wherewith
With
a
wench
King
with
a
child
of
our
grandmother
Eve
a
female
or
for
thy
more
sweet
understanding
a
woman
Him
I
as
my
everesteemed
duty
pricks
me
on
have
sent
to
thee
to
receive
the
meed
of
punishment
by
thy
sweet
Graces
officer
Antony
Dull
a
man
of
good
repute
carriage
bearing
and
estimation
Me
ant
shall
please
you
I
am
Antony
Dull
For
Jaquenetta
so
is
the
weaker
vessel
called
which
I
apprehended
with
the
aforesaid
swain
I
keep
her
as
a
vessel
of
thy
laws
fury
and
shall
at
the
least
of
thy
sweet
notice
bring
her
to
trial
Thine
in
all
compliments
of
devoted
and
heartburning
heat
of
duty
This
is
not
so
well
as
I
lookd
for
but
the
best
that
ever
I
heard
Ay
the
best
for
the
worst
But
sirrah
what
say
you
to
this
Sir
I
confess
the
wench
Did
you
hear
the
proclamation
I
do
confess
much
of
the
hearing
it
but
little
of
the
marking
of
it
It
was
proclaimed
a
years
imprisonment
to
be
taken
with
a
wench
I
was
taken
with
none
sir
I
was
taken
with
a
damsel
Well
it
was
proclaimed
damsel
This
was
no
damsel
neither
sir
she
was
a
virgin
It
is
so
varied
too
for
it
was
proclaimed
virgin
If
it
were
I
deny
her
virginity
I
was
taken
with
a
maid
This
maid
not
serve
your
turn
sir
This
maid
will
serve
my
turn
sir
Sir
I
will
pronounce
your
sentence
you
shall
fast
a
week
with
bran
and
water
I
had
rather
pray
a
month
with
mutton
and
porridge
And
Don
Armado
shall
be
your
keeper
My
Lord
Berowne
see
him
delivered
oer
And
go
we
lords
to
put
in
practice
that
Which
each
to
other
hath
so
strongly
sworn
Ill
lay
my
head
to
any
good
mans
hat
These
oaths
and
laws
will
prove
an
idle
scorn
Sirrah
come
on
I
suffer
for
the
truth
sir
for
true
it
is
I
was
taken
with
Jaquenetta
and
Jaquenetta
is
a
true
girl
and
therefore
welcome
the
sour
cup
of
prosperity
Affliction
may
one
day
smile
again
and
till
then
sit
thee
down
sorrow
Very
reverent
sport
truly
and
done
in
the
testimony
of
a
good
conscience
The
deer
was
as
you
know
sanguis
in
blood
ripe
as
the
pomewater
who
now
hangeth
like
a
jewel
in
the
ear
of
caelo
the
sky
the
welkin
the
heaven
and
anon
falleth
like
a
crab
on
the
face
of
terra
the
soil
the
land
the
earth
Truly
Master
Holofernes
the
epithets
are
sweetly
varied
like
a
scholar
at
the
least
but
sir
I
assure
ye
it
was
a
buck
of
the
first
head
Sir
Nathaniel
haud
credo
Twas
not
a
haud
credo
twas
a
pricket
Most
barbarous
intimation
yet
a
kind
of
insinuation
as
it
were
in
via
in
way
of
explication
facere
as
it
were
replication
or
rather
ostentare
to
show
as
it
were
his
inclination
after
his
undressed
unpolished
uneducated
unpruned
untrained
or
rather
unlettered
or
ratherest
unconfirmed
fashion
to
insert
again
my
haud
credo
for
a
deer
I
Said
the
deer
was
not
a
haud
credo
twas
a
pricket
Twicesod

thou

Ignorance
how
deformed
dost
thou
look
Sir
he
hath
never
fed
of
the
dainties
that
are
bred
in
a
book
He
hath
not
eat
paper
as
it
were
he
hath
not
drunk
ink
his
intellect
is
not
replenished
he
is
only
an
animal
only
sensible
in
the
duller
parts
And
such
barren
plants
are
set
before
us
that
we
thankful
should
be
Which
we
of
taste
and
feeling
are
for
those
parts
that
do
fructify
in
us
more
than
he
For
as
it
would
ill
become
me
to
be
vain
indiscreet
or
a
fool
So
were
there
a
patch
set
on
learning
to
see
him
in
a
school
But
omne
bene
say
I
being
of
an
old
fathers
mind
Many
can
brook
the
weather
that
love
not
the
wind
You
two
are
bookmen
can
you
tell
me
by
your
wit
What
was
a
month
old
at
Cains
birth
thats
not
five
weeks
old
as
yet
Dictynna

Dictynna

What

to

to

The

was
a
month
old
when
Adam
was
no
more
And
raught
not
to
five
weeks
when
he
came
to
fivescore
Th
allusion
holds
in

Tis
true
indeed
the
collusion
holds
in
the
exchange
God
comfort
thy
capacity
I
say
th
allusion
holds
in
the
exchange
And
I
say
the
polusion
holds
in
the
exchange
for
the
moon
is
never
but
a
month
old
and
I
say
beside
that
twas
a
pricket
that
the
Princess
killd
Sir
Nathaniel
will
you
hear
an
extemporal
epitaph
on
the
death
of
the
deer
And
to
humour
the
ignorant
call
the
deer
the
Princess
killd
a
pricket
Perge
good
Master
Holofernes
perge
so
it
shall
please
you
to
abrogate
scurrility
I
Will
something
affect
the
letter
for
it
argues
facility
The
preyful
Princess
piercd
and
prickd
a
pretty
pleasing
pricket
Some
say
a
sore
but
not
a
sore
till
now
made
sore

The

Or

If

then

fifty

Of
one

I
an

make
by
adding
but
one
more
rare
talent
Aside
If
a
talent
be
a
claw
look
how
he
claws
him
with
a
talent
This
is
a
gift
that
I
have
simple
simple
a
foolish
extravagant
spirit
full
of
forms
figures
shapes
objects
ideas
apprehensions
motions
revolutions
These
are
begot
in
the
ventricle
of
memory
nourishd
in
the
womb
of
pia
mater
and
delivered
upon
the
mellowing
of
occasion
But
the
gift
is
good
in
those
in
whom
it
is
acute
and
I
am
thankful
for
it
Sir
I
praise
the
Lord
for
you
and
so
may
my
parishioners
for
their

profit
very
greatly

You
are

of

Mehercle
if
their

be
ingenious
they
shall
want
no

if
their

Under
pardon
sir
what
are
the
contents
or
rather
as
Horace
says
in
his
What
my

verses
Ay
sir
and
very
learned
Let
me
hear
a
staff
a
stanze
a
verse
lege

Reads
If
love
make
me
forsworn
how
shall
I
swear
to
love
Ah
never
faith
could
hold
if
not
to
beauty
vowed
Though
to
myself
forsworn
to
thee
Ill
faithful
prove
Those
thoughts
to
me
were
oaks
to
thee
like
osiers
bowed
Study
his
bias
leaves
and
makes
his

thine
eyes
Where
all
those
pleasures
live
that
art
would
comprehend
If
knowledge
be
the
mark
to
know
thee
shall
suffice
Well
learned
is
that
tongue
that
well
can
thee
commend
All
ignorant
that
soul
that
sees
thee
without
wonder
Which
is
to
me
some
praise
that
I
thy
parts
admire
Thy
eye
Joves
lightning
bears
thy
voice
his
dreadful
thunder
Which
not
to
anger
bent
is
music
and
sweet
fire
Celestial
as
thou
art
pardon
love
this
wrong
That
singes
heavens
praise
with
such
an
earthly
tongue
You
find
not
the
apostrophas
and
so
miss
the

let
me
supervise
the
canzonet
Here
are
only
numbers
ratified
but
for
the
elegancy
facility
and
golden
cadence
of
poesy
caret
Ovidius
Naso
was

man
And
why
indeed
Naso
but
for
smelling
out
the
odoriferous
flowers
of

the

of

Imitari

Ay

from
one
Monsieur
Berowne
one
of
the
strange
queens
lords
I
will
overglance
the
superscript
To
the
snowwhite
hand
of
the
most
beauteous
Lady
Rosaline
I
will
look
again
on

Berowne
Sir
Nathaniel
this
Berowne
is
one
of
the
votaries
with
the
King
and
here
he
hath
framed
a
letter
to
a
sequent
of
the
stranger
queens
which
accidentally
or
by
the
way
of
progression
hath
miscarried
Trip
and
go
my
sweet
deliver
this
paper
into
the
royal
hand
of
the
King
it
may
concern
much
Stay
not
thy
compliment
I
forgive
thy
duty
Adieu
Good
Costard
go
with
me
Sir
God
save
your
life
Have
with
thee
my
girl
Sir
you
have
done
this
in
the
fear
of
God
very
religiously
and
as
a
certain
father
saith
Sir
tell
not
me
of
the
father
I
do
fear
colourable
colours
But
to
return
to
the
verses
did
they
please
you
Sir
Nathaniel
Marvellous
well
for
the
pen
I
do
dine
today
at
the
fathers
of
a
certain
pupil
of
mine
where
if
before
repast
it
shall
please
you
to
gratify
the
table
with
a
grace
I
will
on
my
privilege
I
have
with
the
parents
of
the
foresaid
child
or
pupil
undertake
your
ben
venuto
where
I
will
prove
those
verses
to
be
very
unlearned
neither
savouring
of
poetry
wit
nor
invention
I
beseech
your
society
And
thank
you
too
for
society
saith
the
text
is
the
happiness
of
life
And
certes
the
text
most
infallibly
concludes
it
To
Sir
I
do
invite
you
too
you
shall
not
say
me
nay
pauca

Away
the
gentles
are
at
their
game
and
we
will
to
our
recreation
Sweet
hearts
we
shall
be
rich
ere
we
depart
If
fairings
come
thus
plentifully
in
lady
walld
about
with
diamonds
Look
you
what
I
have
from
the
loving
King
Madam
came
nothing
else
along
with
that
Nothing
but
this
Yes
as
much
love
in
rhyme
As
would
be
crammd
up
in
a
sheet
of
paper
Writ
o
both
sides
the
leaf
margent
and
all
That
he
was
fain
to
seal
on
Cupids
name
That
was
the
way
to
make
his
godhead
wax
For
he
hath
been
five
thousand
year
a
boy
Ay
and
a
shrewd
unhappy
gallows
too
Youll
neer
be
friends
with
him
a
killd
your
sister
He
made
her
melancholy
sad
and
heavy
And
so
she
died
Had
she
been
light
like
you
Of
such
a
merry
nimble
stirring
spirit
She
might
a
been
a
grandam
ere
she
died
And
so
may
you
for
a
light
heart
lives
long
Whats
your
dark
meaning
mouse
of
this
light
word
light
condition
in
a
beauty
dark
We
need
more
light
to
find
your
meaning
out
Youll
mar
the
light
by
taking
it
in
snuff
Therefore
Ill
darkly
end
the
argument
Look
what
you
do
you
do
it
still
i
th
dark
So
do
not
you
for
you
are
a
light
wench
Indeed
I
weigh
not
you
and
therefore
light
You
weigh
me
not
thats
you
care
not
for
me
Great
reason
for
past
cure
is
still
past
care
Well
bandied

set
of
wit
well
playd
But
Rosaline
you
have
a
favour

Who

I
would

An
if
my
face
were
but
as
fair
as
yours
My
favour
were
as
great
be

this
Nay

I
thank
Berowne
The

the
numbring

I
were
the
fairest
goddess
on
the
ground
I
am
compard
to
twenty
thousand
fairs
he
hath
drawn
my
picture
in
his
letter
Anything
like
Much
in
the
letters
nothing
in
the
praise
Beauteous
as
ink
a
good
conclusion
Fair
as
a
text
in
a
copybook
Ware
pencils
ho
Let
me
not
die
your
debtor
My
red
dominical
my
golden
letter
that

But
Katharine

Yes

Vilely

This
and

me
sent
Longaville
The
letter
is
too
long
by
half
a
mile
I
think
no
less
Dost
thou
not
wish
in
heart
The
chain
were
longer
and
the
letter
short
Ay
or
I
would
these
hands
might
never
part
We
are
wise
girls
to
mock
our
lovers
so
They
are
worse
fools
to
purchase
mocking
so
That
same
Berowne
Ill
torture
ere
I
go
that
I
knew
he
were
but
in
by
th
week
How
I
would
make
him
fawn
and
beg
and
seek
And
wait
the
season
and
observe
the
times
And
spend
his
prodigal
wits
in
bootless
rhymes
And
shape
his
service
wholly
to
my
hests
And
make
him
proud
to
make
me
proud
that
jests
So
pertauntlike
would
I
oersway
his
state
That
he
should
be
my
fool
and
I
his
fate
None
are
so
surely
caught
when
they
are
catchd
As
wit
turnd
fool
folly
in
wisdom
hatchd
Hath
wisdoms
warrant
and
the
help
of
school
And
wits
own
grace
to
grace
a
learned
fool
The
blood
of
youth
burns
not
with
such
excess
As
gravitys
revolt
to
wantonness
Folly
in
fools
bears
not
so
strong
a
note
As
foolry
in
the
wise
when
wit
doth
dote
Since
all
the
power
thereof
it
doth
apply
To
prove
by
wit
worth
in
simplicity
Enter
Here
comes
Boyet
and
mirth
is
in
his
face
I
am
stabbd
with
laughter
Wheres
her
Grace
Thy
news
Boyet
Prepare
madam
prepare
Arm
wenches
arm
Encounters
mounted
are
Against
your
peace
Love
doth
approach
disguisd
Armed
in
arguments
youll
be
surprisd
Muster
your
wits
stand
in
your
own
defence
Or
hide
your
heads
like
cowards
and
fly
hence
Saint
Dennis
to
Saint
Cupid
What
are
they
That
charge
their
breath
against
us
Say
scout
say
Under
the
cool
shade
of
a
sycamore
I
thought
to
close
mine
eyes
some
half
an
hour
When
lo
to
interrupt
my
purposd
rest
Toward
that
shade
I
might
behold
addrest
The
King
and
his
companions
warily
I
stole
into
a
neighbour
thicket
by
And
overheard
what
you
shall
overhear
That
by
and
by
disguisd
they
will
be
here
Their
herald
is
a
pretty
knavish
page
That
well
by
heart
hath
connd
his
embassage
Action
and
accent
did
they
teach
him
there
Thus
must
thou
speak
and
thus
thy
body
bear
And
ever
and
anon
they
made
a
doubt
Presence
majestical
would
put
him
out
For
quoth
the
King
an
angel
shalt
thou
see
Yet
fear
not
thou
but
speak
audaciously
The
boy
replied
An
angel
is
not
evil
I
should
have
feard
her
had
she
been
a
devil
With
that
all
laughd
and
clappd
him
on
the
shoulder
Making
the
bold
wag
by
their
praises
bolder
One
rubbd
his
elbow
thus
and
fleerd
and
swore
better
speech
was
never
spoke
before
Another
with
his
finger
and
his
thumb
Cried
Via
we
will
dot
come
what
will
come
The
third
he
caperd
and
cried
All
goes
well
The
fourth
turnd
on
the
toe
and
down
he
fell
With
that
they
all
did
tumble
on
the
ground
With
such
a
zealous
laughter
so
profound
That
in
this
spleen
ridiculous
appears
To
check
their
folly
passions
solemn
tears
But
what
but
what
come
they
to
visit
us
They
do
they
do
and
are
apparelld
thus
Like
Muscovites
or
Russians
as
I
guess
Their
purpose
is
to
parley
court
and
dance
And
every
one
his
lovefeat
will
advance
Unto
his
several
mistress
which
theyll
know
By
favours
several
which
they
did
bestow
And
will
they
so
The
gallants
shall
be
taskd
For
ladies
we
will
every
one
be
maskd
And
not
a
man
of
them
shall
have
the
grace
Despite
of
suit
to
see
a
ladys
face
Hold
Rosaline
this
favour
thou
shalt
wear
And
then
the
King
will
court
thee
for
his
dear
Hold
take
thou
this
my
sweet
and
give
me
thine
So
shall
Berowne
take
me
for
Rosaline
And
change
you
favours
too
so
shall
your
loves
Woo
contrary
deceivd
by
these
removes
Come
on
then
wear
the
favours
most
in
sight
But
in
this
changing
what
is
your
intent
The
effect
of
my
intent
is
to
cross
theirs
They
do
it
but
in
mocking
merriment
And
mock
for
mock
is
only
my
intent
Their
several
counsels
they
unbosom
shall
To
loves
mistook
and
so
be
mockd
withal
Upon
the
next
occasion
that
we
meet
With
visages
displayd
to
talk
and
greet
But
shall
we
dance
if
they
desire
us
tot
No
to
the
death
we
will
not
move
a
foot
Nor
to
their
pennd
speech
render
we
no
grace
But
while
tis
spoke
each
turn
away
her
face
Why
that
contempt
will
kill
the
speakers
heart
And
quite
divorce
his
memory
from
his
part
Therefore
I
do
it
and
I
make
no
doubt
The
rest
will
neer
come
in
if
he
be
out
Theres
no
such
sport
as
sport
by
sport
oerthrown
To
make
theirs
ours
and
ours
none
but
our
own
So
shall
we
stay
mocking
intended
game
And
they
well
mockd
depart
away
with
shame
Trumpet
sounds
within
The
trumpet
sounds
be
maskd
the
maskers
come
The
mask
Enter
music
as
Prologue
the
and
his
as
maskers
in
the
guise
of
Russians
All
hail
the
richest
heauties
on
the
earth
Beauties
no
richer
than
rich
taffeta
holy
parcel
of
the
fairest
dames
The
turn
their
backs
to
him
That
ever
turnd
their
backs
to
mortal
views
Their
eyes
villain
their
eyes
That
ever
turnd
their
eyes
to
mortal
views
Out
True
out
indeed
Out
of
your
favours
heavenly
spirits
vouchsafe
Not
to
behold
Once
to
behold
rogue
Once
to
behold
with
your
sunbeamed
eyes
with
your
sunbeamed
eyes
They
will
not
answer
to
that
epithet
You
were
best
call
it
daughterbeamed
eyes
They
do
not
mark
me
and
that
brings
me
out
Is
this
your
perfectness
Be
gone
you
rogue
What
would
these
strangers
Know
their
minds
Boyet
If
they
do
speak
our
language
tis
our
will
That
some
plain
man
recount
their
purposes
Know
what
they
would
What
would
you
with
the
Princess
Nothing
but
peace
and
gentle
visitation
What
would
they
say
they
Nothing
but
peace
and
gentle
visitation
Why
that
they
have
and
bid
them
so
be
gone
She
says
you
have
it
and
you
may
be
gone
Say
to
her
we
have
measurd
many
miles
To
tread
a
measure
with
her
on
this
grass
They
say
that
they
have
measurd
many
a
mile
To
tread
a
measure
with
you
on
this
grass
It
is
not
so
Ask
them
how
many
inches
Is
in
one
mile
If
they
have
measured
many
The
measure
then
of
one
is
easly
told
If
to
come
hither
you
have
measurd
miles
And
many
miles
the
Princess
bids
you
tell
How
many
inches
doth
fill
up
one
mile
Tell
her
we
measure
them
by
weary
steps
She
hears
herself
How
many
weary
steps
Of
many
weary
miles
you
have
oergone
Are
numbred
in
the
travel
of
one
mile
We
number
nothing
that
we
spend
for
you
Our
duty
is
so
rich
so
infinite
That
we
may
do
it
still
without
accompt
Vouchsafe
to
show
the
sunshine
of
your
face
That
we
like
savages
may
worship
it
My
face
is
but
a
moon
and
clouded
too
Blessed
are
clouds
to
do
as
such
clouds
do
Vouchsafe
bright
moon
and
these
thy
stars
to
shine
Those
clouds
removed
upon
our
watery
eyne
vain
petitioner
beg
a
greater
matter
Thou
now
requests
but
moonshine
in
the
water
Then
in
our
measure
do
but
vouchsafe
one
change
Thou
bidst
me
beg
this
begging
is
not
strange
Play
music
then
Nay
you
must
do
it
soon
Not
yet
No
dance
Thus
change
I
like
the
moon
Will
you
not
dance
How
come
you
thus
estranged
You
took
the
moon
at
full
but
now
shes
changed
Yet
still
she
is
the
Moon
and
I
the
Man
The
music
plays
vouchsafe
some
motion
to
it
Our
ears
vouchsafe
it
But
your
legs
should
do
it
Since
you
are
strangers
and
come
here
by
chance
Well
not
be
nice
take
hands
We
will
not
dance
Why
take
we
hands
then
Only
to
part
friends
Curtsy
sweet
hearts
and
so
the
measure
ends
More
measure
of
this
measure
be
not
nice
We
can
afford
no
more
at
such
a
price
Price
you
yourselves
What
buys
your
company
Your
absence
only
That
can
never
be
Then
cannot
we
be
bought
and
so
adieu
Twice
to
your
visor
and
half
once
to
you
If
you
deny
to
dance
lets
hold
more
chat
In
private
then
I
am
best
pleasd
with
that
They
converse
apart
Whitehanded
mistress

sweet
word
with
thee
Honey

milk
and
sugar

Nay

Metheglin

Theres

a
dozen
sweets
Seventh
sweet
adieu
Since
you
can
cog
Ill
play
no
more
with
you
One
word
in
secret
Let
it
not
be
sweet
Thou
grievest
my
gall
Gall
bitter
Therefore

They
converse
apart
Will
you
vouchsafe
with
me
to
change
a
word
Name

Fair
lady
Say

so
Fair
lord
Take
that
for
your
fair
lady
Please

you
As
much
in
private
and
Ill
bid
adieu
They
converse
apart
What
was
your
vizard
made
without
a
tongue
I
know
the
reason
lady
why
you
ask
for
your
reason
Quickly
sir
I
long
You
have
a
double
tongue
within
your
mask
And
would
afford
my
speechless
vizard
half
Veal
quoth
the
Dutchman
Is
not
veal
a
calf
calf
fair
lady
No
a
fair
lord
calf
Lets
part
the
word
No
Ill
not
be
your
half
Take
all
and
wean
it
it
may
prove
an
ox
Look
how
you
butt
yourself
in
these
sharp
mocks
Will
you
give
horns
chaste
lady
Do
not
so
Then
die
a
calf
before
your
horns
do
grow
One
word
in
private
with
you
ere
I
die
Bleat
softly
then
the
butcher
hears
you
cry
They
converse
apart
The
tongues
of
mocking
wenches
are
as
keen
As
is
the
razors
edge
invisible
Cutting
a
smaller
hair
than
may
be
seen
Above
the
sense
of
sense
so
sensible
Seemeth
their
conference
their
conceits
have
wings
Fleeter
than
arrows
bullets
wind
thought
swifter
things
Not
one
word
more
my
maids
break
off
break
off
By
heaven
all
drybeaten
with
pure
scoff
Farewell
mad
wenches
you
have
simple
wits
Twenty
adieus
my
frozen
Muscovits
Are
these
the
breed
of
wits
so
wondered
at
Tapers
they
are
with
your
sweet
breaths
puffd
out
Wellliking
wits
they
have
gross
gross
fat
fat
poverty
in
wit
kinglypoor
flout
Will
they
not
think
you
hang
themselves
tonight
Or
ever
but
in
vizards
show
their
faces
This
pert
Berowne
was
out
of
countnance
quite
They
were
all
in
lamentable
cases
The
King
was
weepingripe
for
a
good
word
Berowne
did
swear
himself
out
of
all
suit
Dumain
was
at
my
service
and
his
sword
No
point
quoth
I
my
servant
straight
was
mute
Lord
Longaville
said
I
came
oer
his
heart
And
trow
you
what
he
calld
me
Qualm
perhaps
Yes
in
good
faith
Go
sickness
as
thou
art
Well
better
wits
have
worn
plain
statutecaps
But
will
you
hear
The
King
is
my
love
sworn
And
quick
Berowne
hath
plighted
faith
to
me
And
Longaville
was
for
my
service
born
Dumain
is
mine
as
sure
as
bark
on
tree
Madam
and
pretty
mistresses
give
ear
Immediately
they
will
again
be
here
In
their
own
shapes
for
it
can
never
be
They
will
digest
this
harsh
indignity
Will
they
return
They
will
they
will
God
knows
And
leap
for
joy
though
they
are
lame
with
blows
Therefore
change
favours
and
when
they
repair
Blow
like
sweet
roses
in
this
summer
air
How
blow
how
blow
Speak
to
be
understood
Fair
ladies
maskd
are
roses
in
their
bud
Dismaskd
their
damask
sweet
commixture
shown
Are
angels
vailing
clouds
or
roses
blown
Avaunt
perplexity
What
shall
we
do
If
they
return
in
their
own
shapes
to
woo
Good
madam
if
by
me
youll
be
advisd
Lets
mock
them
still
as
well
known
as
disguisd
Let
us
complain
to
them
what
fools
were
here
Disguisd
like
Muscovites
in
shapeless
gear
And
wonder
what
they
were
and
to
what
end
Their
shallow
shows
and
prologue
vilely
pennd
And
their
rough
carriage
so
ridiculous
Should
be
presented
at
our
tent
to
us
Ladies
withdraw
the
gallants
are
at
hand
Whip
to
our
tents
as
roes
run
oer
land
Reenter
the
and
in
their
proper
habits
Fair
sir
God
save
you
Wheres
the
Princess
Gone
to
her
tent
Please
it
your
Majesty
Command
me
any
service
to
her
thither
That
she
vouchsafe
me
audience
for
one
word
I
will
and
so
will
she
I
know
my
lord
This
fellow
pecks
up
wit
as
pigeons
pease
And
utters
it
again
when
God
doth
please
He
is
wits
pedlar
and
retails
his
wares
At
wakes
and
wassails
meetings
markets
fairs
And
we
that
sell
by
gross
the
Lord
doth
know
Have
not
the
grace
to
grace
it
with
such
show
This
gallant
pins
the
wenches
on
his
sleeve
Had
he
been
Adam
he
had
tempted
Eve
can
carve
too
and
lisp
why
this
is
he
That
kissd
his
hand
away
in
courtesy
This
is
the
ape
of
form
Monsieur
the
Nice
That
when
he
plays
at
tables
chides
the
dice
In
honourable
terms
nay
he
can
sing
mean
most
meanly
and
in
ushering
Mend
him
who
can
The
ladies
call
him
sweet
The
stairs
as
he
treads
on
them
kiss
his
feet
This
is
the
flowr
that
smiles
on
every
one
To
show
his
teeth
as
white
as
whalesbone
And
consciences
that
will
not
die
in
debt
Pay
him
the
due
of
honeytongued
Boyet
blister
on
his
sweet
tongue
with
my
heart
That
put
Armados
page
out
of
his
part
Reenter
the
ushered
by
and
See
where
it
comes
Behaviour
what
wert
thou
Till
this
man
showd
thee
And
what
art
thou
now
All
hail
sweet
madam
and
fair
time
of
day
Fair
in
all
hail
is
foul
as
I
conceive
Construe
my
speeches
better
if
you
may
Then
wish
me
better
I
will
give
you
leave
We
came
to
visit
you
and
purpose
now
To
lead
you
to
our
court
vouchsafe
it
then
This
field
shall
hold
me
and
so
hold
your
vow
Nor
God
nor
I
delights
in
perjurd
men
Rebuke
me
not
for
that
which
you
provoke
The
virtue
of
your
eye
must
break
my
oath
You
nickname
virtue
vice
you
should
have
spoke
For
virtues
office
never
breaks
mens
troth
Now
by
my
maiden
honour
yet
as
pure
As
the
unsullied
lily
I
protest
world
of
torments
though
I
should
endure
I
would
not
yield
to
be
your
houses
guest
So
much
I
hate
a
breaking
cause
to
be
Of
heavenly
oaths
vowed
with
integrity
you
have
livd
in
desolation
here
Unseen
unvisited
much
to
our
shame
Not
so
my
lord
it
is
not
so
I
swear
We
have
had
pastimes
here
and
pleasant
game
mess
of
Russians
left
us
but
of
late
How
madam
Russians
Ay
in
truth
my
lord
Trim
gallants
full
of
courtship
and
of
state
Madam
speak
true
It
is
not
so
my
lord
My
lady
to
the
manner
of
the
days
In
courtesy
gives
undeserving
praise
We
four
indeed
confronted
were
with
four
In
Russian
habit
here
they
stayed
an
hour
And
talkd
apace
and
in
that
hour
my
lord
They
did
not
bless
us
with
one
happy
word
I
dare
not
call
them
fools
but
this
I
think
When
they
are
thirsty
fools
would
fain
have
drink
This
jest
is
dry
to
me
Fair
gentle
sweet
Your
wit
makes
wise
things
foolish
when
we
greet
With
eyes
best
seeing
heavens
fiery
eye
By
light
we
lose
light
your
capacity
Is
of
that
nature
that
to
your
huge
store
Wise
things
seem
foolish
and
rich
things
but
poor
This
proves
you
wise
and
rich
for
in
my
eye
I
am
a
fool
and
full
of
poverty
But
that
you
take
what
doth
to
you
belong
It
were
a
fault
to
snatch
words
from
my
tongue
I
am
yours
and
all
that
I
possess
All
the
fool
mine
I
cannot
give
you
less
Which
of
the
vizards
was
it
that
you
wore
Where
when
what
vizard
Why
demand
you
this
There
then
that
vizard
that
superfluous
case
That
hid
the
worse
and
showd
the
better
face
We
were
descried
theyll
mock
us
now
downright
Let
us
confess
and
turn
it
to
a
jest
Amazd
my
lord
Why
looks
your
Highness
sad
Help
hold
his
brows
hell
swoon
Why
look
you
pale
Seasick
I
think
coming
from
Muscovy
Thus
pour
the
stars
down
plagues
for
perjury
Can
any
face
of
brass
hold
longer
out
Here
stand
I
lady
dart
thy
skill
at
me
Bruise
me
with
scorn
confound
me
with
a
flout
Thrust
thy
sharp
wit
quite
through
my
ignorance
Cut
me
to
pieces
with
thy
keen
conceit
And
I
will
wish
thee
never
more
to
dance
Nor
never
more
in
Russian
habit
wait
never
will
I
trust
to
speeches
pennd
Nor
to
the
motion
of
a
schoolboys
tongue
Nor
never
come
in
vizard
to
my
friend
Nor
woo
in
rhyme
like
a
blind
harpers
song
Taffeta
phrases
silken
terms
precise
Threepild
hyperboles
spruce
affectation
Figures
pedantical
these
summerflies
Have
blown
me
full
of
maggot
ostentation
I
do
forswear
them
and
I
here
protest
By
this
white
glove
how
white
the
hand
God
knows
Henceforth
my
wooing
mind
shall
be
expressd
In
russet
yeas
and
honest
kersey
noes
And
to
begin
wench
so
God
help
me
law
My
love
to
thee
is
sound
sans
crack
or
flaw
Sans

I
pray

Yet
I

a
trick
Of
the
old
rage

with
me
I
am
sick
Ill
leave
it
by
degrees
Soft
let
us
see
Write
Lord
have
mercy
on
us
on
those
three
They
are
infected
in
their
hearts
it
lies
They
have
the
plague
and
caught
it
of
your
eyes
These
lords
are
visited
you
are
not
free
For
the
Lords
tokens
on
you
do
I
see
No
they
are
free
that
gave
these
tokens
to
us
Our
states
are
forfeit
seek
not
to
undo
us
It
is
not
so
for
how
can
this
be
true
That
you
stand
forfeit
being
those
that
sue
Peace
for
I
will
not
have
to
do
with
you
Nor
shall
not
if
I
do
as
I
intend
Speak
for
yourselves
my
wit
is
at
an
end
Teach
us
sweet
madam
for
our
rude
transgression
Some
fair
excuse
The
fairest
is
confession
Were
not
you
here
but
even
now
disguisd
Madam
I
was
And
were
you
well
advisd
I
was
fair
madam
When
you
then
were
here
What
did
you
whisper
in
your
ladys
ear
That
more
than
all
the
world
I
did
respect
her
When
she
shall
challenge
this
you
will
reject
her
Upon
mine
honour
no
Peace
peace
forbear
Your
oath
once
broke
you
force
not
to
forswear
Despise
me
when
I
break
this
oath
of
mine
I
will
and
therefore
keep
it
Rosaline
What
did
the
Russian
whisper
in
your
ear
Madam
he
swore
that
he
did
hold
me
dear
As
precious
eyesight
and
did
value
me
Above
this
world
adding
thereto
moreover
That
he
would
wed
me
or
else
die
my
lover
God
give
thee
joy
of
him
The
noble
lord
Most
honourably
doth
uphold
his
word
What
mean
you
madam
By
my
life
my
troth
I
never
swore
this
lady
such
an
oath
By
heaven
you
did
and
to
confirm
it
plain
You
gave
me
this
but
take
it
sir
again
My
faith
and
this
the
Princess
I
did
give
I
knew
her
by
this
jewel
on
her
sleeve
Pardon
me
sir
this
jewel
did
she
wear
And
Lord
Berowne
I
thank
him
is
my
dear
What
will
you
have
me
or
your
pearl
again
Neither
of
either
I
remit
both
twain
I
see
the
trick
ont
here
was
a
consent
Knowing
aforehand
of
our
merriment
To
dash
it
like
a
Christmas
comedy
Some
carrytale
some
pleaseman
some
slight
zany
Some
mumblenews
some
trencherknight
some
Dick
That
smiles
his
cheek
in
years
and
knows
the
trick
To
make
my
lady
laugh
when
shes
disposd
Told
our
intents
before
which
once
disclosd
The
ladies
did
change
favours
and
then
we
Following
the
signs
wood
but
the
sign
of
she
Now
to
our
perjury
to
add
more
terror
We
are
again
forsworn
in
will
and
error
Much
upon
this
it
is
To
and
might
not
you
Forestall
our
sport
to
make
us
thus
untrue
Do
not
you
know
my
ladys
foot
by
th
squier
And
laugh
upon
the
apple
of
her
eye
And
stand
between
her
back

and
the
fire
Holding
a
trencher
jesting
merrily
You

Go

a

be
your

You

Wounds

Full

Whether

What

No

vara
fine
For

pursents
three
And

Not

Under

By
Jove
I
always

threes
for

Lord
sir
it
were
pity
you
should
get
your
living
by
reckning
sir
How
much
is
it
Lord

the
parties
themselves
the
actors
sir
will
show
whereuntil
it
doth
amount
For
mine
own
part
I
am

but
to
parfect
one
man
in
one
poor
man
Pompion
the
Great
sir
Art
thou
one
of
the
Worthies
It
pleased
them
to
think
me
worthy
of
Pompey
the
Great
for
mine
own
part
I
know
not
the
degree
of
the
Worthy
but
I
am
to
stand
for

Go

prepare
We
will
turn

will
take
some
care
Berowne
they
will
shame
us
let

not
approach
We
are
shameproof
my
lord
and
tis
some
policy
To
have
one
show
worse
than
the
Kings
and
his
company
I
say
they
shall
not
come
Nay
my
good
lord
let
me
oerrule
you
now
That
sport
best
pleases
that
doth
least

how
Where
zeal
strives
to
content
and
the
contents
Dies
in
the
zeal
of
that
which
it
presents
Their
form
confounded
makes
most
form
in
mirth
When
great
things
labouring
perish
in
their
birth

Doth

Why

That

Stand

Thus
did
he
strangle

Quoniam

apology
Keep

The

The

But

Hector

cleantimberd
His

Hectors
More

No

This

I

Worthies
Ill

Most

a
buttonhole

Do
you

Pompey

combat
What
mean
you
You
will
lose
your
reputation
Gentlemen
and
soldiers
pardon
me
I
will
not
combat
in
my
shirt
You
may
not
deny
it
Pompey
hath
made
the
challenge
Sweet
bloods
I
both
may
and
will
What
reason
have
you
for
t
The
naked
truth
of
it
is
I
have
no
shirt
I
go
woolward
for
penance
True
and
it
was
enjoined
him
in
Rome
for
want
of
linen
since
when
Ill
be
sworn
he
wore
none
but
a
dishclout
of
Jaquenettas
and
that
a
wears
next
his
heart
for
a
favour
Enter
as
messenger
God
save
you
madam
Welcome
Marcade
But
that
thou
interruptest
our
merriment
I
am
sorry
madam
for
the
news
I
bring
Is
heavy
in
my
tongue
The
King
your
father
Dead
for
my
life
Even
so
my
tale
is
told
WOrthies
away
the
scene
begins
to
cloud
For
mine
own
part
I
breathe
free
breath
I
have
seen
the
day
of
wrong
through
the
little
hole
of
discretion
and
I
will
right
myself
like
a
soldier
How
fares
your
Majesty
Boyet
prepare
I
will
away
tonight
Madam
not
so
I
do
beseech
you
stay
Prepare
I
say
I
thank
you
gracious
lords
For
all
your
fair
endeavours
and
entreat
Out
of
a
newsad
soul
that
you
vouchsafe
In
your
rich
wisdom
to
excuse
or
hide
The
liberal
opposition
of
our
spirits
If
overboldly
we
have
borne
ourselves
In
the
converse
of
breath
your
gentleness
Was
guilty
of
it
Farewell
worthy
lord
heavy
heart
bears
not
a
nimble
tongue
Excuse
me
so
coming
too
short
of
thanks
For
my
great
suit
so
easily
obtaind
The
extreme
parts
of
time
extremely
forms
All
causes
to
the
purpose
of
his
speed
And
often
at
his
very
loose
decides
That
which
long
process
could
not
arbitrate
And
though
the
mourning
brow
of
progeny
Forbid
the
smiling
courtesy
of
love
The
holy
suit
which
fain
it
would
convince
Yet
since
loves
argument
was
first
on
foot
Let
not
the
cloud
of
sorrow
justle
it
From
what
it
purposd
since
to
wail
friends
lost
Is
not
by
much
so

As
to
rejoice
at
friends
but
newly
found
I
understand
you
not
my
griefs
are
double
Honest
plain
words
best
pierce
the
ear
of
grief
And
by
these
badges
understand
the
King
For
your
fair
sakes
have
we
neglected
time
Playd
foul
play
with
our
oaths
your
beauty
ladies
Hath
much
deformed
us
fashioning
our
humours
Even
to
the
opposed
end
of
our
intents
And
what
in
us
hath
seemd
ridiculous
As
love
is
full
of
unbefitting
strains
All
wanton
as
a
child
skipping
and
vain
Formd
by
the
eye
and
therefore
like
the
eye
Full
of
strange
shapes
of
habits
and
of
forms
Varying
in
subjects
as
the
eye
doth
roll
To
every
varied
object
in
his
glance
Which
particoated
presence
of
loose
love
Put
on
by
us
if
in
your
heavenly
eyes
Have
misbecomd
our
oaths
and
gravities
Those
heavenly
eyes
that
look
into
these
faults
Suggested
us
to
make
Therefore
ladies
Our
love
being
yours
the
error
that
love
makes
Is
likewise
yours
We
to
ourselves
prove
false
By
being
once
false
for
ever
to
be
true
To
those
that
make
us
both
fair
ladies
you
And
even
that
falsehood
in
itself
a
sin
Thus
purifies
itself
and
turns
to
grace
We
have
receivd
your
letters
full
of
love
Your
favours
the
ambassadors
of
love
And
in
our
maiden
council
rated
them
At
courtship
pleasant
jest
and
courtesy
As
bombast
and
as
lining
to
the
time
But
more
devout
than
this
in
our
respects
Have
we
not
been
and
therefore
met
your
loves
In
their
own
fashion
like
a
merriment
Our
letters
madam
showd
much
more
than
jest
So
did
our
looks
We
did
not
quote
them
so
Now
at
the
latest
minute
of
the
hour
Grant
us
your
loves
time
methinks
too
short
To
make
a
worldwithoutend
bargain
in
No
no
my
lord
your
Grace
is
perjurd
much
Full
of
dear
guiltiness
and
therefore
this
If
for
my
love
as
there
is
no
such
cause
You
will
do
aught
this
shall
you
do
for
me
Your
oath
I
will
not
trust
but
go
with
speed
To
some
forlorn
and
naked
hermitage
Remote
from
all
the
pleasures
of
the
world
There
stay
until
the
twelve
celestial
signs
Have
brought
about
the
annual
reckoning
If
this
austere
insociable
life
Change
not
your
offer
made
in
heat
of
blood
If
frosts
and
fasts
hard
lodging
and
thin
weeds
Nip
not
the
gaudy
blossoms
of
your
love
But
that
it
bear
this
trial
and
last
love
Then
at
the
expiration
of
the
year
Come
challenge
me
challenge
me
by
these
deserts
And
by
this
virgin
palm
now
kissing
thine
I
will
be
thine
and
till
that
instant
shut
My
woeful
self
up
in
a
mournful
house
Raining
the
tears
of
lamentation
For
the
remembrance
of
my
fathers
death
If
this
thou
do
deny
let
our
hands
part
Neither
intitled
in
the
others
heart
If
this
or
more
than
this
I
would
deny
To
flatter
up
these
powers
of
mine
with
rest
The
sudden
hand
of
death
close
up
mine
eye
Hence
hermit
then
my
heart
is
in
thy
breast
And
what
to
me
my
love
and
what
to
me
You
must
he
purged
too
your
sins
are
rackd
You
are
attaint
with
faults
and
perjury
Therefore
if
you
my
favour
mean
to
get
twelvemonth
shall
you
spend
and
never
rest
But
seek
the
weary
beds
of
people
sick
But
what
to
me
my
love
but
what
to
me
wife
beard
fair
health
and
honesty
With
threefold
love
I
wish
you
all
these
three
shall
I
say
I
thank
you
gentle
wife
No
so
my
lord
a
twelvemonth
and
a
day
Ill
mark
no
words
that
smoothfacd
wooers
say
Come
when
the
King
doth
to
my
lady
come
Then
if
I
have
much
love
Ill
give
you
some
Ill
serve
thee
true
and
faithfully
till
then
Yet
swear
not
lest
ye
be
forsworn
again
What
says
Maria
At
the
twelvemonths
end
Ill
change
my
black
gown
for
a
faithful
friend
Ill
stay
with
patience
but
the
time
is
long
The
liker
you
few
taller
are
so
young
Studies
my
lady
Mistress
look
on
me
Behold
the
window
of
my
heart
mine
eye
What
humble
suit
attends
thy
answer
there
Impose
some
service
on
me
for
thy
love
Oft
have
I
heard
of
you
my
Lord
Berowne
Before
I
saw
you
and
the
worlds
large
tongue
Proclaims
you
for
a
man
replete
with
mocks
Full
of
comparisons
and
wounding
flouts
Which
you
on
all
estates
will
execute
That
lie
within
the
mercy
of
your
wit
To
weed
this
wormwood
from
your
fruitful
brain
And
therewithal
to
win
me
if
you
please
Without
the
which
I
am
not
to
be
won
You
shall
this
twelvemonth
term
from
day
to
day
Visit
the
speechless
sick
and
still
converse
With
groaning
wretches
and
your
task
shall
be
With
all
the
fierce
endeavour
of
your
wit
To
enforce
the
pained
impotent
to
smile
To
move
wild
laughter
in
the
throat
of
death
It
cannot
be
it
is
impossible
Mirth
cannot
move
a
soul
in
agony
Why
thats
the
way
to
choke
a
gibing
spirit
Whose
influence
is
begot
of
that
loose
grace
Which
shallow
laughing
hearers
give
to
fools
jests
prosperity
lies
in
the
ear
Of
him
that
hears
it
never
in
the
tongue
Of
him
that
makes
it
then
if
sickly
ears
Deafd
with
the
clamours
of
their
own
dear
groans
Will
hear
your
idle
scorns
continue
then
And
I
will
have
you
and
that
fault
withal
But
if
they
will
not
throw
away
that
spirit
And
I
shall
find
you
empty
of
that
fault
Right
joyful
of
your
reformation
twelvemonth
Well
befall
what
will
befall
Ill
jest
a
twelvemonth
in
an
hospital
To
the
King
Ay
sweet
my
lord
and
so
I
take
my
leave
No
madam
we
will
bring
you
on
your
way
Our
wooing
doth
not
end
like
an
old
play
Jack
hath
not
Jill
These
ladies
courtesy
Might
well
have
made
our
sport
a
comedy
Come
sir
it
wants
a
twelvemonth
an
a
day
And
then
twill
end
Thats
too
long
for
a
play
Reenter
Sweet
Majesty
vouchsafe
me
Was
not
that
not
Hector
The
worthy
knight
of
Troy
I
will
kiss
thy
royal
finger
and
take
leave
I
am
a
votary
I
have
vowd
to
Jaquenetta
to
hold
the
plough
for
her
sweet
love
three
year
But
most
esteemed
greatness
will
you
hear
the
dialogue
that
the
two
learned
men
have
compiled
in
praise
of
the
Owl
and
the
Cuckoo
It
should
have
followed
in
the
end
of
our
show
Call
them
forth

Peace

Enter
Macbeth

So
foul
and
fair
a

I
have
not
seen
How
far
ist
calld
to
Forres
What
are
these
So
witherd
and
so
wild
in
their
attire
That
look
not
like
the
inhabitants
o
the
earth
And
yet
are
ont
Live
you
or
are
you
aught
That
man
may
question
You
seem
to
understand
me
By
each
at
once
her
choppy
finger
laying
Upon
her
skinny
lips
You
should
be
women
And
yet
your
beards
forbid
me
to
interpret
That
you
are
so
Speak
if
you
can
What
are
you
All
hail
Macbeth
hail
to
thee
Thane
of
Glamis
All
hail
Macbeth
hail
to
thee
Thane
of
Cawdor
All
hail
Macbeth
that
shalt
be
King
hereafter
Good
sir
why
do
you
start
and
seem
to
fear
Things
that
do
sound
so
fair
I
the
name
of
truth
Are
ye
fantastical
or
that
indeed
Which
outwardly
ye
show
My
noble
partner
You
greet
with
present
grace
and
great
prediction
Of
noble
having
and
of
royal
hope
That
he
seems
rapt
withal
To
me
you
speak
not
If
you
can
look
into
the
seeds
of
time
And
say
which
grain
will
grow
and
which
will
not
Speak
then
to
me
who
neither
beg
nor
fear
Your
favors
nor
your
hate
Hail
Hail
Hail
Lesser
than
Macbeth
and
greater
Not
so
happy
yet
much
happier
Thou
shalt
get
kings
though
thou
be
none
So
all
hail
Macbeth
and
Banquo
Banquo
and
Macbeth
all
hail
Stay
you
imperfect
speakers
tell
me
more
By
Sinels
death
I
know
I
am
Thane
of
Glamis
But
how
of
Cawdor
The
Thane
of
Cawdor
lives
prosperous
gentleman
and
to
be
King
Stands
not
within
the
prospect
of
belief
No
more
than
to
be
Cawdor
Say
from
whence
You
owe
this
strange
intelligence
or
why
Upon
this
blasted
heath
you
stop
our
way
With
such
prophetic
greeting
Speak
I
charge
you
Witches
vanish
The
earth
hath
bubbles
as
the
water
has
And
these
are
of
them
Whither
are
they
vanishd
Into
the
air
and
what
seemd
corporal
melted
As
breath
into
the
wind
Would
they
had
stayd
Were
such
things
here
as
we
do
speak
about
Or
have
we
eaten
on
the
insane
root
That
takes
the
reason
prisoner
Your
children
shall
be
kings
You
shall
be
King
And
Thane
of
Cawdor
too
Went
it
not
so
To
the
selfsame
tune
and
words
Whos
here
Enter
Ross
and
Angus
The
King
hath
happily
received
Macbeth
The
news
of
thy
success
and
when
he
reads
Thy
personal
venture
in
the
rebels
fight
His
wonders
and
his
praises
do
contend
Which
should
be
thine
or
his
Silenced
with
that
In
viewing
oer
the
rest
o
the
selfsame
day
He
finds
thee
in
the
stout
Norweyan
ranks
Nothing
afeard
of
what
thyself
didst
make
Strange
images
of
death
As
thick
as
hail
Came
post
with
post
and
every
one
did
bear
Thy
praises
in
his
kingdoms
great
defense
And
pourd
them
down
before
him
We
are
sent
To
give
thee
from
our
royal
master
thanks
Only
to
herald
thee
into
his
sight
Not
pay
thee
And
for
an
earnest
of
a
greater
honor
He
bade
me
from
him
call
thee
Thane
of
Cawdor
In
which
addition
hail
most
worthy
Thane
For
it
is
thine
What
can
the
devil
speak
true
The
Thane
of
Cawdor
lives
Why
do
you
dress
me
In
borrowd
robes
Who
was
the
Thane
lives
yet
But
under
heavy
judgement
bears
that
life
Which
he
deserves
to
lose
Whether
he
was
combined
With
those
of
Norway
or
did
line
the
rebel
With
hidden
help
and
vantage
or
that
with
both
He
labord
in
his
countrys
wreck
I
know
not
But
treasons
capital
confessd
and
proved
Have
overthrown
him
Aside
Glamis
and
Thane
of
Cawdor
The
greatest
is
behind
To
Ross
and
Angus
Thanks
for
your
pains
Aside
to
Banquo
Do
you
not
hope
your
children
shall
be
kings
When
those
that
gave
the
Thane
of
Cawdor
to
me
Promised
no
less
to
them
Aside
to
Macbeth
That
trusted
home
Might
yet
enkindle
you
unto
the
crown
Besides
the
Thane
of
Cawdor
But
tis
strange
And
oftentimes
to
win
us
to
our
harm
The
instruments
of
darkness
tell
us
truths
Win
us
with
honest
trifles
to
betrays
In
deepest
consequence
Cousins
a
word
I
pray
you
Aside
Two
truths
are
told
As
happy
prologues
to
the
swelling
act
Of
the
imperial
themeI
thank
you
gentlemen
Aside
This
supernatural
soliciting
Cannot
be
ill
cannot
be
good
If
ill
Why
hath
it
given
me
earnest
of
success
Commencing
in
a
truth
I
am
Thane
of
Cawdor
If
good
why
do
I
yield
to
that
suggestion
Whose
horrid
image
doth
unfix
my
hair
And
make
my
seated
heart
knock
at
my
ribs
Against
the
use
of
nature
Present
fears
Are
less
than
horrible
imaginings
My
thought
whose
murther
yet
is
but
fantastical
Shakes
so
my
single
state
of
man
that
function
Is
smotherd
in
surmise
and
nothing
is
But
what
is
not
Look
how
our
partners
rapt
Aside
If
chance
will
have
me
King
why
chance
may
crown
me
Without
my
stir
New
honors
come
upon
him
Like
our
strange
garments
cleave
not
to
their
mould
But
with
the
aid
of
use
Aside
Come
what
come
may
Time
and
the
hour
runs
through
the
roughest
day
Worthy
Macbeth
we
stay
upon
your
leisure
Give
me
your
favor
my
dull
brain
was
wrought
With
things
forgotten
Kind
gentlemen
your
pains
Are
registerd
where
every
day
I
turn
The
leaf
to
read
them
Let
us
toward
the
King
Think
upon
what
hath
chanced
and
at
more
time
The
interim
having
weighd
it
let
us
speak
Our
free
hearts
each
to
other
Very
gladly
Till
then
enough
Come
friends
They
met
me
in
the
day
of
success
and
I
have
learned
by
the
perfectest
report
they
have
more
in
them
than
mortal
knowledge
When
I
burned
in
desire
to
question
them
further
they
made
themselves
air
into
which
they
vanished
Whiles
I
stood
rapt
in
the
wonder
of
it
came
missives
from
the
King
who
allhailed
me
Thane
of
Cawdor
by
which
title
before
these
weird
sisters
saluted
me
and
referred
me
to
the
coming
on
of
time
with
Hail
King
that
shalt
be
This
have
I
thought
good
to
deliver
thee
my
dearest
partner
of
greatness
that
thou
mightst
not
lose
the
dues
of
rejoicing
by
being
ignorant
of
what
greatness
is
promised
thee
Lay
it
to
thy
heart
and
farewell
Glamis
thou
art
and
Cawdor
and
shalt
be
What
thou
art
promised
Yet
do
I
fear
thy
nature
It
is
too
full
o
the
milk
of
human
kindness
To
catch
the
nearest
way
Thou
wouldst
be
great
Art
not
without
ambition
but
without
The
illness
should
attend
it
What
thou
wouldst
highly
That
wouldst
thou
holily
wouldst
not
play
false
And
yet
wouldst
wrongly
win
Thouldst
have
great
Glamis
That
which
cries
Thus
thou
must
do
if
thou
have
it
And
that
which
rather
thou
dost
fear
to
do
Than
wishest
should
be
undone
Hie
thee
hither
That
I
may
pour
my
spirits
in
thine
ear
And
chastise
with
the
valor
of
my
tongue
All
that
impedes
thee
from
the
golden
round
Which
fate
and
metaphysical
aid
doth
seem
To
have
thee
crownd
withal
Enter
a
Messenger
What
is
your
tidings
The
King
comes
here
tonight
Thourt
mad
to
say
it
Is
not
thy
master
with
him
who
weret
so
Would
have
informd
for
preparation
So
please
you
it
is
true
our
Thane
is
coming
One
of
my
fellows
had
the
speed
of
him
Who
almost
dead
for
breath
had
scarcely
more
Than
would
make
up
his
message
Give
him
tending
He
brings
great
news
The
raven
himself
is
hoarse
That
croaks
the
fatal
entrance
of
Duncan
Under
my
battlements
Come
you
spirits
That
tend
on
mortal
thoughts
unsex
me
here
And
fill
me
from
the
crown
to
the
toe
topfull
Of
direst
cruelty
Make
thick
my
blood
Stop
up
the
access
and
passage
to
remorse
That
no
compunctious
visitings
of
nature
Shake
my
fell
purpose
nor
keep
peace
between
The
effect
and
it
Come
to
my
womans
breasts
And
take
my
milk
for
gall
your
murthering
ministers
Wherever
in
your
sightless
substances
You
wait
on
natures
mischief
Come
thick
night
And
pall
thee
in
the
dunnest
smoke
of
hell
That
my
keen
knife
see
not
the
wound
it
makes
Nor
heaven
peep
through
the
blanket
of
the
dark
To
cry
Hold
hold
Enter
Macbeth
Great
Glamis
Worthy
Cawdor
Greater
than
both
by
the
allhail
hereafter
Thy
letters
have
transported
me
beyond
This
ignorant
present
and
I
feel
now
The
future
in
the
instant
My
dearest
love
Duncan
comes
here
tonight
And
when
goes
hence
Tomorrow
as
he
purposes
never
Shall
sun
that
morrow
see
Your
face
my
Thane
is
as
a
book
where
men
May
read
strange
matters
To
beguile
the
time
Look
like
the
time
bear
welcome
in
your
eye
Your
hand
your
tongue
look
like
the
innocent
flower
But
be
the
serpent
under
it
He
thats
coming
Must
be
provided
for
and
you
shall
put
This
nights
great
business
into
my
dispatch
Which
shall
to
all
our
nights
and
days
to
come
Give
solely
sovereign
sway
and
masterdom
We
will
speak
further
Only
look
up
clear
To
alter
favor
ever
is
to
fear
Leave
all
the
rest
to
me
If
it
were
done
when
tis
done
then
twere
well
It
were
done
quickly
If
the
assassination
Could
trammel
up
the
consequence
and
catch
With
his
surcease
success
that
but
this
blow
Might
be
the
beall
and
the
endall
here
But
here
upon
this
bank
and
shoal
of
time
Weld
jump
the
life
to
come
But
in
these
cases
We
still
have
judgement
here
that
we
but
teach
Bloody
instructions
which
being
taught
return
To
plague
the
inventor
This
evenhanded
justice
Commends
the
ingredients
of
our
poisond
chalice
To
our
own
lips
Hes
here
in
double
trust
First
as
I
am
his
kinsman
and
his
subject
Strong
both
against
the
deed
then
as
his
host
Who
should
against
his
murtherer
shut
the
door
Not
bear
the
knife
myself
Besides
this
Duncan
Hath
borne
his
faculties
so
meek
hath
been
So
clear
in
his
great
office
that
his
virtues
Will
plead
like
angels
trumpettongued
against
The
deep
damnation
of
his
takingoff
And
pity
like
a
naked
newborn
babe
Striding
the
blast
or
heavens
cherubin
horsed
Upon
the
sightless
couriers
of
the
air
Shall
blow
the
horrid
deed
in
every
eye
That
tears
shall
drown
the
wind
I
have
no
spur
To
prick
the
sides
of
my
intent
but
only
Vaulting
ambition
which
oerleaps
itself
And
falls
on
the
other
Enter
Lady
Macbeth
How
now
what
news
He
has
almost
suppd
Why
have
you
left
the
chamber
Hath
he
askd
for
me
Know
you
not
he
has
We
will
proceed
no
further
in
this
business
He
hath
honord
me
of
late
and
I
have
bought
Golden
opinions
from
all
sorts
of
people
Which
would
be
worn
now
in
their
newest
gloss
Not
cast
aside
so
soon
Was
the
hope
drunk
Wherein
you
dressd
yourself
Hath
it
slept
since
And
wakes
it
now
to
look
so
green
and
pale
At
what
it
did
so
freely
From
this
time
Such
I
account
thy
love
Art
thou
afeard
To
be
the
same
in
thine
own
act
and
valor
As
thou
art
in
desire
Wouldst
thou
have
that
Which
thou
esteemst
the
ornament
of
life
And
live
a
coward
in
thine
own
esteem
Letting
I
dare
not
wait
upon
I
would
Like
the
poor
cat
i
the
adage
Prithee
peace
I
dare
do
all
that
may
become
a
man
Who
dares
do
more
is
none
What
beast
wast
then
That
made
you
break
this
enterprise
to
me
When
you
durst
do
it
then
you
were
a
man
And
to
be
more
than
what
you
were
you
would
Be
so
much
more
the
man
Nor
time
nor
place
Did
then
adhere
and
yet
you
would
make
both
They
have
made
themselves
and
that
their
fitness
now
Does
unmake
you
I
have
given
suck
and
know
How
tender
tis
to
love
the
babe
that
milks
me
I
would
while
it
was
smiling
in
my
face
Have
pluckd
my
nipple
from
his
boneless
gums
And
dashd
the
brains
out
had
I
so
sworn
as
you
Have
done
to
this
If
we
should
fail
We
fail
But
screw
your
courage
to
the
stickingplace
And
well
not
fail
When
Duncan
is
asleep
Whereto
the
rather
shall
his
days
hard
journey
Soundly
invite
him
his
two
chamberlains
Will
I
with
wine
and
wassail
so
convince
That
memory
the
warder
of
the
brain
Shall
be
a
fume
and
the
receipt
of
reason
limbeck
only
When
in
swinish
sleep
Their
drenched
natures
lie
as
in
a
death
What
cannot
you
and
I
perform
upon
The
unguarded
Duncan
What
not
put
upon
His
spongy
officers
who
shall
bear
the
guilt
Of
our
great
quell
Bring
forth
menchildren
only
For
thy
undaunted
mettle
should
compose
Nothing
but
males
Will
it
not
be
received
When
we
have
markd
with
blood
those
sleepy
two
Of
his
own
chamber
and
used
their
very
daggers
That
they
have
donet
Who
dares
receive
it
other
As
we
shall
make
our
griefs
and
clamor
roar
Upon
his
death
I
am
settled
and
bend
up
Each
corporal
agent
to
this
terrible
feat
Away
and
mock
the
time
with
fairest
show
False
face
must
hide
what
the
false
heart
doth
know
I
Inverness
Court
of
Macbeths
castle
Enter
Banquo
and
Fleance
bearing
a
torch
before
him
How
goes
the
night
boy
The
moon
is
down
I
have
not
heard
the
clock
And
she
goes
down
at
twelve
I
taket
tis
later
sir
Hold
take
my
sword
Theres
husbandry
in
heaven
Their
candles
are
all
out
Take
thee
that
too
heavy
summons
lies
like
lead
upon
me
And
yet
I
would
not
sleep
Merciful
powers
Restrain
in
me
the
cursed
thoughts
that
nature
Gives
way
to
in
repose
Enter
Macbeth
and
a
Servant
with
a
torch
Give
me
my
sword
Whos
there
friend
What
sir
not
yet
at
rest
The
Kings
abed
He
hath
been
in
unusual
pleasure
and
Sent
forth
great
largess
to
your
offices
This
diamond
he
greets
your
wife
withal
By
the
name
of
most
kind
hostess
and
shut
up
In
measureless
content
Being
unprepared
Our
will
became
the
servant
to
defect
Which
else
should
free
have
wrought
Alls
well
I
dreamt
last
night
of
the
three
weird
sisters
To
you
they
have
showd
some
truth
I
think
not
of
them
Yet
when
we
can
entreat
an
hour
to
serve
We
would
spend
it
in
some
words
upon
that
business
If
you
would
grant
the
time
At
your
kindst
leisure
If
you
shall
cleave
to
my
consent
when
tis
It
shall
make
honor
for
you
So
I
lose
none
In
seeking
to
augment
it
but
still
keep
My
bosom
franchised
and
allegiance
clear
I
shall
be
counseld
Good
repose
the
while
Thanks
sir
the
like
to
you
Go
bid
thy
mistress
when
my
drink
is
ready
She
strike
upon
the
bell
Get
thee
to
bed
Is
this
a
dagger
which
I
see
before
me
The
handle
toward
my
hand
Come
let
me
clutch
thee
I
have
thee
not
and
yet
I
see
thee
still
Art
thou
not
fatal
vision
sensible
To
feeling
as
to
sight
Or
art
thou
but
dagger
of
the
mind
a
false
creation
Proceeding
from
the
heatoppressed
brain
I
see
thee
yet
in
form
as
palpable
As
this
which
now
I
draw
Thou
marshalst
me
the
way
that
I
was
going
And
such
an
instrument
I
was
to
use
Mine
eyes
are
made
the
fools
o
the
other
senses
Or
else
worth
all
the
rest
I
see
thee
still
And
on
thy
blade
and
dudgeon
gouts
of
blood
Which
was
not
so
before
Theres
no
such
thing
It
is
the
bloody
business
which
informs
Thus
to
mine
eyes
Now
oer
the
one
halfworld
Nature
seems
dead
and
wicked
dreams
abuse
The
curtaind
sleep
witchcraft

Pale
Hecates
offerings
and

Murther
Alarumd
by
his
sentinel
the
wolf
Whose
howls
his
watch
thus
with
his
stealthy
pace
With
Tarquins
ravishing
strides
towards
his
design
Moves
like
a
ghost
Thou
sure
and
firmset
earth
Hear
not
my
steps
which
way
they
walk
for
fear
Thy
very
stones
prate
of
my
whereabout
And
take
the
present
horror
from
the
time
Which
now
suits
with
it
Whiles
I
threat
he
lives
Words
to
the
heat
of
deeds
too
cold

bell

I
go
and
it
is
done
the
bell
invites
me
Hear
it
not
Duncan
for
it
is
a
knell
That
summons
thee
to
heaven
or
to
hell
Heres
a
knocking
indeed
If
a
man
were
porter
of
Hell
Gate
he
should
have

Knocking

Knocking

Anon

Opens

Enter
Macduff

Was
it
so

ere
you
went
to
bed
That
you
do
lie
so
late
Faith
sir
we
were
carousing
till
the
second
cock
and
drink
sir
is
a
great
provoker
of
three
things
What
three
things
does
drink
especially
provoke
Marry
sir
nosepainting
sleep
and
urine
Lechery
sir
it
provokes
and
unprovokes
it
provokes
the
desire
but
it
takes
away
the
performance
Therefore
much
drink
may
be
said
to
be
an
equivocator
with
lechery
it
makes
him
and
it
mars
him
it
sets
him
on
and
it
takes
him
off
it
persuades
him
and
disheartens
him
makes
him
stand
to
and
not
stand
to
in
conclusion
equivocates
him
in
a
sleep
and
giving
him
the
lie
leaves
him
I
believe
drink
gave
thee
the
lie
last
night
That
it
did
sir
i
the
very
throat
on
me
but
requited
him
for
his
lie
and
I
think
being
too
strong
for
him
though
he
took
up
my
legs
sometime
yet
I
made
shift
to
cast
him
Is
thy
master
stirring
Enter
Macbeth
Our
knocking
has
awaked
him
here
he
comes
Good
morrow
noble
sir
morrow
both
Is
the
King
stirring
worthy
Thane
Not
yet
He
did
command
me
to
call
timely
on
him
I
have
almost
slippd
the
hour
Ill
bring
you
to
him
I
know
this
is
a
joyful
trouble
to
you
But
yet
tis
one
The
labor
we
delight
in
physics
pain
This
is
the
door
Ill
make
so
bold
to
call
For
tis
my
limited
service
Goes
the
King
hence
today
He
does
he
did
appoint
so
The
night
has
been
unruly
Where
we
lay
Our
chimneys
were
blown
down
and
as
they
say
Lamentings
heard
i
the
air
strange
screams
of
death
And
prophesying
with
accents
terrible
Of
dire
combustion
and
confused
events
New
hatchd
to
the
woeful
time
The
obscure
bird
Clamord
the
livelong
night
Some
say
the
earth
Was
feverous
and
did
shake
Twas
a
rough
fight
My
young
remembrance
cannot
parallel
fellow
to
it
Reenter
Macduff
horror
horror
horror
Tongue

Cannot
conceive
nor

Whats
the
matter
Confusion
now
hath
made
his
masterpiece
Most
sacrilegious
murther
hath
broke
ope
The
Lords
anointed
temple
and
stole
thence
The
life
o
the
building
What
ist
you
say
the
life
Mean
you
his
Majesty
Approach
the
chamber
and
destroy
your
sight
With
a
new
Gorgon
Do
not

See
and
then
speak
yourselves
Awake

Ring

alarum

Murther

Donalbain
Malcolm

Shake

And
look
on
death

Up

and
see
The
great

As
from
your
graves
rise
up
and
walk
like
sprites
To
countenance

horror
Ring

bell
Bell

Enter
Lady
Macbeth
Whats
the
business
That
such
a
hideous
trumpet
calls
to
parley
The
sleepers
of
the
house
Speak
speak
gentle
lady
Tis
not
for
you
to
hear
what
I
can
speak
The
repetition
in
a
womans
ear
Would
murther
as
it
fell
Enter
Banquo
Banquo
Banquo
Our
royal
masters
murtherd
Woe
alas
What
in
our
house
Too
cruel
anywhere
Dear
Duff
I
prithee
contradict
thyself
And
say
it
is
not
so
Reenter
Macbeth
and
Lennox
with
Ross
Had
I
but
died
an
hour
before
this
chance
I
had
lived
a
blessed
time
for
from
this
instant
Theres
nothing
serious
in
mortality
All
is
but
toys
renown
and
grace
is
dead
The
wine
of
life
is
drawn
and
the
mere
lees
Is
left
this
vault
to
brag
of
Enter
Malcolm
and
Donalbain
What
is
amiss
You
are
and
do
not
knowt
The
spring
the
head
the
fountain
of
your
blood
Is
stopped
the
very
source
of
it
is
stoppd
Your
royal
fathers
murtherd
by
whom
Those
of
his
chamber
as
it
seemd
had
donet
Their
hands
and
faces
were
all
badged
with
blood
So
were
their
daggers
which
unwiped
we
found
Upon
their
pillows
They
stared
and
were
distracted
no
mans
life
Was
to
be
trusted
with
them
yet
I
do
repent
me
of
my
fury
That
I
did
kill
them
Wherefore
did
you
so
Who
can
be
wise
amazed
temperate
and
furious
Loyal
and
neutral
in
a
moment
No
man
The
expedition
of
my
violent
love
Outrun
the
pauser
reason
Here
lay
Duncan
His
silver
skin
laced
with
his
golden
blood
And
his
gashd
stabs
lookd
like
a
breach
in
nature
For
ruins
wasteful
entrance
there
the
murtherers
Steepd
in
the
colors
of
their
trade
their
daggers
Unmannerly
breechd
with
gore
Who
could
refrain
That
had
a
heart
to
love
and
in
that
heart
Courage
to
make
s
love
known
Help
me
hence
ho
Look
to
the
lady
Aside
to
Donalbain
Why
do
we
hold
our
tongues
That
most
may
claim
this
argument
for
ours
Aside
to
Malcolm
What
should
be
spoken
here
where
our
fate
Hid
in
an
auger
hole
may
rush
and
seize
us
Lets
away
Our
tears
are
not
yet
brewd
Aside
to
Donalbain
Nor
our
strong
sorrow
Upon
the
foot
of
motion
Look
to
the
lady
Lady
Macbeth
is
carried
out
And
when
we
have
our
naked
frailties
hid
That
suffer
in
exposure
let
us
meet
And
question
this
most
bloody
piece
of
work
To
know
it
further
Fears
and
scruples
shake
us
In
the
great
hand
of
God
I
stand
and
thence
Against
the
undivulged
pretense
I
fight
Of
treasonous
malice
And
so
do
I
So
all
Lets
briefly
put
on
manly
readiness
And
meet
i
the
hall
together
Well
contented
What
will
you
do
Lets
not
consort
with
them
To
show
an
unfelt
sorrow
is
an
office
Which
the
false
man
does
easy
Ill
to
England
To
Ireland
I
our
separated
fortune
Shall
keep
us
both
the
safer
Where
we
are
Theres
daggers
in
mens
smiles
the
near
in
blood
The
nearer
bloody
This
murtherous
shaft
thats
shot
Hath
not
yet
lighted
and
our
safest
way
Is
to
avoid
the
aim
Therefore
to
horse
And
let
us
not
be
dainty
of
leavetaking
But
shift
away
Theres
warrant
in
that
theft
Which
steals
itself
when
theres
no
mercy
left
Is
Banquo
gone
from
court
Ay
madam
but
returns
again
tonight
Say
to
the
King
I
would
attend
his
leisure
For
a
few
words
Madam
I
will
Noughts
had
alls
spent
Where
our
desire
is
got
without
content
Tis
safer
to
be
that
which
we
destroy
Than
by
destruction
dwell
in
doubtful
joy
Enter
Macbeth
How
now
my
lord
Why
do
you
keep
alone
Of
sorriest
fancies
your
companions
making
Using
those
thoughts
which
should
indeed
have
died
With
them
they
think
on
Things
without
all
remedy
Should
be
without
regard
Whats
done
is
done
We
have
scotchd
the
snake
not
killd
it
Shell
close
and
be
herself
whilst
our
poor
malice
Remains
in
danger
of
her
former
tooth
But
let
the
frame
of
things
disjoint
both
the
worlds
suffer
Ere
we
will
eat
our
meal
in
fear
and
sleep
In
the
affliction
of
these
terrible
dreams
That
shake
us
nightly
Better
be
with
the
dead
Whom
we
to
gain
our
peace
have
sent
to
peace
Than
on
the
torture
of
the
mind
to
lie
In
restless
ecstasy
Duncan
is
in
his
grave
After
lifes
fitful
fever
he
sleeps
well
Treason
has
done
his
worst
nor
steel
nor
poison
Malice
domestic
foreign
levy
nothing
Can
touch
him
further
Come
on
Gentle
my
lord
sleek
oer
your
rugged
looks
Be
bright
and
jovial
among
your
guests
tonight
So
shall
I
love
and
so
I
pray
be
you
Let
your
remembrance
apply
to
Banquo
Present
him
eminence
both
with
eye
and
tongue
Unsafe
the
while
that
we
Must
lave
our
honors
in
these
flattering
streams
And
make
our
faces
vizards
to
our
hearts
Disguising
what
they
are
You
must
leave
this
full
of
scorpions
is
my
mind
dear
wife
Thou
knowst
that
Banquo
and
his
Fleance
lives
But
in
them
natures
copys
not
eterne
Theres
comfort
yet
they
are
assailable
Then
be
thou
jocund
Ere
the
bat
hath
flown
His
cloisterd
flight
ere
to
black
Hecates
summons
The
shardborne
beetle
with
his
drowsy
hums
Hath
rung
nights
yawning
peal
there
shall
be
done
deed
of
dreadful
note
Whats
to
be
done
Be
innocent
of
the
knowledge
dearest
chuck
Till
thou
applaud
the
deed
Come
seeling
night
Scarf
up
the
tender
eye
of
pitiful
day
And
with
thy
bloody
and
invisible
hand
Cancel
and
tear
to
pieces
that
great
bond
Which
keeps
me
pale
Light
thickens
and
the
crow
Makes
wing
to
the
rooky
wood
Good
things
of
day
begin
to
droop
and
drowse
Whiles
nights
black
agents
to
their
preys
do
rouse
Thou
marvelst
at
my
words
but
hold
thee
still
Things
bad
begun
make
strong
themselves
by
ill
So
prithee
go
with
me
Hall
in
the
palace
banquet
prepared
Enter
Macbeth
Lady

Ross
Lennox
Lords

Attendants
You

At
first
And
last
the
hearty
welcome
Thanks
to
your
Majesty
Ourself
will
mingle
with
society
And
play
the
humble
host
Our
hostess
keeps
her
state
but
in
best
time
We
will
require
her
welcome
Pronounce
it
for
me
sir
to
all
our
friends
For
my
heart
speaks
they
are
welcome
Enter
first
Murtherer
to
the
door
See

thee
with
their
hearts
thanks
Both
sides
are
even
here
Ill
sit
i
the
midst
Be
large
in
mirth
anon
well
drink
a
measure
The
table
round
Approaches
the
door
Theres
blood
upon
thy
face
Tis
Banquos
then
Tis
better
thee
without
than
he
within
Is
he
dispatchd
My
lord
his
throat
is
cut
that
I
did
for
him
Thou
art
the
best
o
the
cutthroats
Yet
hes
good
That
did
the
like
for
Fleance
If
thou
didst
it
Thou
art
the
nonpareil
Most
royal
sir
Fleance
is
scaped
Aside
Then
comes
my
fit
again
I
had
else
been
perfect
Whole
as
the
marble
founded
as
the
rock
As
broad
and
general
as
the
casing
air
But
now
I
am
cabind
cribbd
confind
bound
in
To
saucy
doubts
and
fears
But
Banquos
safe
Ay
my
good
lord
Safe
in
a
ditch
he
bides
With
twenty
trenched
gashes
on
his
head
The
least
a
death
to
nature
Thanks
for
that
There
the
grown
serpent
lies
the
worm
thats
fled
Hath
nature
that
in
time
will
venom
breed
No
teeth
for
the
present
Get
thee
gone
Tomorrow
Well
hear
ourselves
again
My
royal
lord
You
do
not
give
the
cheer
The
feast
is
sold
That
is
not
often
vouchd
while
tis
amaking
Tis
given
with
welcome
To
feed
were
best
at
home
From
thence
the
sauce
to
meat
is
ceremony
Meeting
were
bare
without
it
Sweet
remembrancer
Now
good
digestion
wait
on
appetite
And
health
on
both
Mayt
please
your
Highness
sit
The
Ghost
of
Banquo
enters
and
sits
in
Macbeths
place
Here
had
we
now
our
countrys
honor
roofd
Were
the
graced
person
of
our
Banquo
present
Who
may
I
rather
challenge
for
unkindness
Than
pity
for
mischance
His
absence
sir
Lays
blame
upon
his
promise
Pleaset
your
Highness
To
grace
us
with
your
royal
company
The
tables
full
Here
is
a
place
reserved
sir
Where
Here
my
good
lord
What
ist
that
moves
your
Highness
Which
of
you
have
done
this
What
my
good
lord
Thou
canst
not
say
I
did
it
never
shake
Thy
gory
locks
at
me
Gentlemen
rise
his
Highness
is
well
Sit
worthy
friends
my
lord
is
often
thus
And
hath
been
from
his
youth
Pray
you
keep
seat
The
fit
is
momentary
upon
a
thought
He
will
again
be
well
If
much
you
note
him
You
shall
offend
him
and
extend
his
passion
Feed
and
regard
him
notAre
you
a
man
Ay
and
a
bold
one
that
dare
look
on
that
Which
might
appal
the
devil
proper
stuff
This
is
the
very
painting
of
your
fear
This
is
the
airdrawn
dagger
which
you
said
Led
you
to
Duncan
these
flaws
and
starts
Impostors
to
true
fear
would
well
become
womans
story
at
a
winters
fire
Authorized
by
her
grandam
Shame
itself
Why
do
you
make
such
faces
When
alls
done
You
look
but
on
a
stool
Prithee
see
there
Behold
Look
Lo
How
say
you
Why
what
care
I
If
thou
canst
nod
speak
too
If
charnel
houses
and
our
graves
must
send
Those
that
we
bury
back
our
monuments
Shall
be
the
maws
of
kites
What
quite
unmannd
in
folly
If
I
stand
here
I
saw
him
Fie
for
shame
Blood
hath
been
shed
ere
now
i
the
olden
time
Ere
humane
statute
purged
the
gentle
weal
Ay
and
since
too
murthers
have
been
performd
Too
terrible
for
the
ear
The
time
has
been
That
when
the
brains
were
out
the
man
would
die
And
there
an
end
but
now
they
rise
again
With
twenty
mortal
murthers
on
their
crowns
And
push
us
from
our
stools
This
is
more
strange
Than
such
a
murther
is
My
worthy
lord
Your
noble
friends
do
lack
you
I
do
forget
Do
not
muse
at
me
my
most
worthy
friends
I
have
a
strange
infirmity
which
is
nothing
To
those
that
know
me
Come
love
and
health
to
all
Then
Ill
sit
down
Give
me
some
wine
fill
full
I
drink
to
the
general
joy
o
the
whole
table
And
to
our
dear
friend
Banquo
whom
we
miss
Would
he
were
here
To
all
and
him
we
thirst
And
all
to
all
Our
duties
and
the
pledge
Reenter
Ghost
Avaunt
and
quit
my
sight
Let
the
earth
hide
thee
Thy
bones
are
marrowless
thy
blood
is
cold
Thou
hast
no
speculation
in
those
eyes
Which
thou
dost
glare
with
Think
of
this
good
peers
But
as
a
thing
of
custom
Tis
no
other
Only
it
spoils
the
pleasure
of
the
time
What
man
dare
I
dare
Approach
thou
like
the
rugged
Russian
bear
The
armd
rhinoceros
or
the
Hyrcan
tiger
Take
any
shape
but
that
and
my
firm
nerves
Shall
never
tremble
Or
be
alive
again
And
dare
me
to
the
desert
with
thy
sword
If
trembling
I
inhabit
then
protest
me
The
baby
of
a
girl
Hence
horrible
shadow
Unreal
mockery
hence
Why
so
being
gone
I
am
a
man
again
Pray
you
sit
still
You
have
displaced
the
mirth
broke
the
good
meeting
With
most
admired
disorder
Can
such
things
be
And
overcome
us
like
a
summers
cloud
Without
our
special
wonder
You
make
me
strange
Even
to
the
disposition
that
I
owe
When
now
I
think
you
can
behold
such
sights
And
keep
the
natural
ruby
of
your
cheeks
When
mine
is
blanchd
with
fear
What
sights
my
lord
I
pray
you
speak
not
he
grows
worse
and
worse
Question
enrages
him
At
once
good
night
Stand
not
upon
the
order
of
your
going
But
go
at
once
Good
night
and
better
health
Attend
his
Majesty
kind
good
night
to
all
will
have
blood
they
say
blood
will
have
blood
Stones
have
been
known
to
move
and
trees
to
speak
Augures
and
understood
relations
have
By
maggot
pies
and
choughs
and
rooks
brought
forth
The
secretst
man
of
blood
What
is
the
night
Almost
at
odds
with
morning
which
is
which
How
sayst
thou
that
Macduff
denies
his
person
At
our
great
bidding
Did
you
send
to
him
sir
I
hear
it
by
the
way
but
I
will
send
Theres
not
a
one
of
them
but
in
his
house
I
keep
a
servant
feed
I
will
tomorrow
And
betimes
I
will
to
the
weird
sisters
More
shall
they
speak
for
now
I
am
bent
to
know
By
the
worst
means
the
worst
For
mine
own
good
All
causes
shall
give
way
I
am
in
blood
Steppd
in
so
far
that
should
I
wade
no
more
Returning
were
as
tedious
as
go
oer
Strange
things
I
have
in
head
that
will
to
hand
Which
must
be
acted
ere
they
may
be
scannd
You
lack
the
season
of
all
natures
sleep
Come
well
to
sleep
My
strange
and
selfabuse
Is
the
initiate
fear
that
wants
hard
use
We
are
yet
but
young
in
deed
My
former
speeches
have
but
hit
your
thoughts
Which
can
interpret
farther
only
I
say
Things
have
been
strangely
borne
The
gracious
Duncan
Was
pitied
of
Macbeth
marry
he
was
dead
And
the
right
valiant
Banquo
walkd
too
late
Whom
you
may
say
ift
please
you
Fleance
killd
For
Fleance
fled
Men
must
not
walk
too
late
Who
cannot
want
the
thought
how
monstrous
It
was
for
Malcolm
and
for
Donalbain
To
kill
their
gracious
father
Damned
fact
How
it
did
grieve
Macbeth
Did
he
not
straight
In
pious
rage
the
two
delinquents
tear
That
were
the
slaves
of
drink
and
thralls
of
sleep
Was
not
that
nobly
done
Ay
and
wisely
too
For
twould
have
angerd
any
heart
alive
To
hear
the
men
denyt
So
that
I
say
He
has
borne
all
things
well
and
I
do
think
That
had
he
Duncans
sons
under
his
key
As
ant
please
heaven
he
shall
not
they
should
find
What
twere
to
kill
a
father
so
should
Fleance
But
peace
For
from
broad
words
and
cause
he
faild
His
presence
at
the
tyrants
feast
I
hear
Macduff
lives
in
disgrace
Sir
can
you
tell
Where
he
bestows
himself
The
son
of
Duncan
From
whom
this
tyrant
holds
the
due
of
birth
Lives
in
the
English
court
and
is
received
Of
the
most
pious
Edward
with
such
grace
That
the
malevolence
of
fortune
nothing
Takes
from
his
high
respect
Thither
Macduff
Is
gone
to
pray
the
holy
King
upon
his
aid
To
wake
Northumberland
and
warlike
Siward
That
by
the
help
of
these
with
Him
above
To
ratify
the
work
we
may
again
Give
to
our
tables
meat
sleep
to
our
nights
Free
from
our
feasts
and
banquets
bloody
knives
Do
faithful
homage
and
receive
free
honors
All
which
we
pine
for
now
And
this
report
Hath
so
exasperate
the
King
that
he
Prepares
for
some
attempt
of
war
Sent
he
to
Macduff
He
did
and
with
an
absolute
Sir
not
I
The
cloudy
messenger
turns
me
his
back
And
hums
as
who
should
say
Youll
rue
the
time
That
clogs
me
with
this
answer
And
that
well
might
Advise
him
to
a
caution
to
hold
what
distance
His
wisdom
can
provide
Some
holy
angel
Fly
to
the
court
of
England
and
unfold
His
message
ere
he
come
that
a
swift
blessing
May
soon
return
to
this
our
suffering
country
Under

hand
accursed
Ill
send

prayers

Though

Though

on
their
warders
heads
Though
palaces
and
pyramids

slope
Their
heads
to
their
foundations
though

Of

germaines

Even

And

And

Thunder
Third
Apparition
a
Child
crowned
with
a
tree
in
his
hand
What
is
this
That
rises
like
the
issue
of
a
king
And
wears
upon
his
baby
brow
the
round
And
top
of
sovereignty
Listen

Be

proud
and
take
no

Who

be
until
Great
Birnam
Wood

Dunsinane
Hill
Shall
come
against

Descends
That

Who

Unfix

earthbound

Sweet

good
Rebellions
head
rise
never
till
the
Wood
Of
Birnam
rise
and
our
highplaced
Macbeth
Shall
live
the
lease
of
nature
pay
his
breath
To
time
and
mortal
custom
Yet
my
heart
Throbs
to
know
one
thing
tell
me
if
your
art
Can
tell
so
much
shall
Banquos
issue
ever
Reign
in
this
kingdom
Seek
to
know
no
more
I
will
be
satisfied
Deny
me
this
And
an
eternal
curse
fall
on
you
Let
me
know
Why
sinks
that
cauldron
and
what
noise
is
this
Hautboys
Show
Show
Show
Show
his
eyes
and
grieve
his
heart
Come
like
shadows
so
depart
show
of
eight
Kings
the
last
with
a
glass
in
his
hand
Banquos
Ghost
following
Thou
are
too
like
the
spirit
of
Banquo
Down
Thy
crown
does
sear
mine
eyeballs
And
thy
hair
Thou
other
goldbound
brow
is
like
the
first
third
is
like
the
former
Filthy
hags
Why
do
you
show
me
this
fourth
Start
eyes
What
will
the
line
stretch
out
to
the
crack
of
doom
Another
yet
seventh
Ill
see
no
more
And
yet
the
eighth
appears
who
bears
a
glass
Which
shows
me
many
more
and
some
I
see
That
twofold
balls
and
treble
sceptres
carry
Horrible
sight
Now
I
see
tis
true
For
the
bloodbolterd
Banquo
smiles
upon
me
And
points
at
them
for
his
What
is
this
so
Ay
sir
all
this
is
so
But
why
Stands
Macbeth
thus
amazedly
Comesisters
cheer
we
up
his
sprites
And
show
the
best
of
our
delights
Ill
charm
the
air
to
give
a
sound
While
you
perform
your
antic
round
That
this
great
King
may
kindly
say
Our
duties
did
his
welcome
pay
Music
The
Witches
dance
and
then
vanish
with
Hecate
are
they
Gone
Let
this
pernicious
hour
Stand
ay
accursed
in
the
calendar
Come
in
without
there
Enter
Lennox
Whats
your
Graces
will
Saw
you
the
weird
sisters
No
my
lord
Came
they
not
by
you
No
indeed
my
lord
Infected
be
the
air
whereon
they
ride
And
damnd
all
those
that
trust
them
I
did
hear
The
galloping
of
horse
Who
wast
came
by
Tis
two
or
three
my
lord
that
bring
you
word
Macduff
is
fled
to
England
Fled
to
England
Ay
my
good
lord
Aside
Time
thou
anticipatest
my
dread
exploits
The
flighty
purpose
never
is
oertook
Unless
the
deed
go
with
it
From
this
moment
The
very
firstlings
of
my
heart
shall
be
The
firstlings
of
my
hand
And
even
now
To
crown
my
thoughts
with
acts
be
it
thought
and
done
The
castle
of
Macduff
I
will
surprise
Seize
upon
Fife
give
to
the
edge
o
the
sword
His
wife
his
babes
and
all
unfortunate
souls
That
trace
him
in
his
line
No
boasting
like
a
fool
This
deed
Ill
do
before
this
purpose
cool
But
no
more
sights
Where
are
these
gentlemen
Come
bring
me
where
they
are
Let
us
seek
out
some
desolate
shade
and
there
Weep
our
sad
bosoms
empty
Let
us
rather
Hold
fast
the
mortal
sword
and
like
good
men
Bestride
our
downfalln
birthdom
Each
new
morn
New
widows
howl
new
orphans
cry
new
sorrows
Strike
heaven
on
the
face
that
it
resounds
As
if
it
felt
with
Scotland
and
yelld
out
Like
syllable
of
dolor
What
I
believe
Ill
wall
What
know
believe
and
what
I
can
redress
As
I
shall
find
the
time
to
friend
I
will
What
you
have
spoke
it
may
be
so
perchance
This
tyrant
whose
sole
name
blisters
our
tongues
Was
once
thought
honest
You
have
loved
him
well
He
hath
not
touchd
you
yet
I
am
young
but
something
You
may
deserve
of
him
through
me
and
wisdom
To
offer
up
a
weak
poor
innocent
lamb
To
appease
an
angry
god
I
am
not
treacherous
But
Macbeth
is
good
and
virtuous
nature
may
recoil
In
an
imperial
charge
But
I
shall
crave
your
pardon
That
which
you
are
my
thoughts
cannot
transpose
Angels
are
bright
still
though
the
brightest
fell
Though
all
things
foul
would
wear
the
brows
of
grace
Yet
grace
must
still
look
so
I
have
lost
my
hopes
Perchance
even
there
where
I
did
find
my
doubts
Why
in
that
rawness
left
you
wife
and
child
Those
precious
motives
those
strong
knots
of
love
Without
leavetaking
I
pray
you
Let
not
my
jealousies
be
your
dishonors
But
mine
own
safeties
You
may
be
rightly
just
Whatever
I
shall
think
Bleed
bleed
poor
country
Great
tyranny
lay
thou
thy
basis
sure
For
goodness
dare
not
check
thee
Wear
thou
thy
wrongs
The
title
is
affeerd
Fare
thee
well
lord
I
would
not
be
the
villain
that
thou
thinkst
For
the
whole
space
thats
in
the
tyrants
grasp
And
the
rich
East
to
boot
Be
not
offended
I
speak
not
as
in
absolute
fear
of
you
I
think
our
country
sinks
beneath
the
yoke
It
weeps
it
bleeds
and
each
new
day
a
gash
Is
added
to
her
wounds
I
think
withal
There
would
be
hands
uplifted
in
my
right
And
here
from
gracious
England
have
I
offer
Of
goodly
thousands
But
for
all
this
When
I
shall
tread
upon
the
tyrants
head
Or
wear
it
on
my
sword
yet
my
poor
country
Shall
have
more
vices
than
it
had
before
More
suffer
and
more
sundry
ways
than
ever
By
him
that
shall
succeed
What
should
he
be
It
is
myself
I
mean
in
whom
I
know
All
the
particulars
of
vice
so
grafted
That
when
they
shall
be
opend
black
Macbeth
Will
seem
as
pure
as
snow
and
the
poor
state
Esteem
him
as
a
lamb
being
compared
With
my
confineless
harms
Not
in
the
legions
Of
horrid
hell
can
come
a
devil
more
damnd
In
evils
to
top
Macbeth
I
grant
him
bloody
Luxurious
avaricious
false
deceitful
Sudden
malicious
smacking
of
every
sin
That
has
a
name
But
theres
no
bottom
none
In
my
voluptuousness
Your
wives
your
daughters
Your
matrons
and
your
maids
could
not
fill
up
The
cestern
of
my
lust
and
my
desire
All
continent
impediments
would
oerbear
That
did
oppose
my
will
Better
Macbeth
Than
such
an
one
to
reign
Boundless
intemperance
In
nature
is
a
tyranny
it
hath
been
The
untimely
emptying
of
the
happy
throne
And
fall
of
many
kings
But
fear
not
yet
To
take
upon
you
what
is
yours
You
may
Convey
your
pleasures
in
a
spacious
plenty
And
yet
seem
cold
the
time
you
may
so
hoodwink
We
have
willing
dames
enough
there
cannot
be
That
vulture
in
you
to
devour
so
many
As
will
to
greatness
dedicate
themselves
Finding
it
so
inclined
With
this
there
grows
In
my
most
illcomposed
affection
such
stanchless
avarice
that
were
I
King
I
should
cut
off
the
nobles
for
their
lands
Desire
his
jewels
and
this
others
house
And
my
morehaving
would
be
as
a
sauce
To
make
me
hunger
more
that
I
should
forge
Quarrels
unjust
against
the
good
and
loyal
Destroying
them
for
wealth
This
avarice
Sticks
deeper
grows
with
more
pernicious
root
Than
summerseeming
lust
and
it
hath
been
The
sword
of
our
slain
kings
Yet
do
not
fear
Scotland
hath
foisons
to
fill
up
your
will
Of
your
mere
own
All
these
are
portable
With
other
graces
weighd
But
I
have
none
The
kingbecoming
graces
As
justice
verity
temperance
stableness
Bounty
perseverance
mercy
lowliness
Devotion
patience
courage
fortitude
I
have
no
relish
of
them
but
abound
In
the
division
of
each
several
crime
Acting
it
many
ways
Nay
had
I
power
I
should
Pour
the
sweet
milk
of
concord
into
hell
Uproar
the
universal
peace
confound
All
unity
on
earth
Scotland
Scotland
If
such
a
one
be
fit
to
govern
speak
I
am
as
I
have
spoken
Fit
to
govern
No
not
to
live
nation
miserable
With
an
untitled
tyrant
bloodyscepterd
When
shalt
thou
see
thy
wholesome
days
again
Since
that
the
truest
issue
of
thy
throne
By
his
own
interdiction
stands
accursed
And
does
blaspheme
his
breed
Thy
royal
father
Was
a
most
sainted
king
the
queen
that
bore
thee
Oftener
upon
her
knees
than
on
her
feet
Died
every
day
she
lived
Fare
thee
well
These
evils
thou
repeatst
upon
thyself
Have
banishd
me
from
Scotland
my
breast
Thy
hope
ends
here
Macduff
this
noble
passion
Child
of
integrity
hath
from
my
soul
Wiped
the
black
scruples
reconciled
my
thoughts
To
thy
good
truth
and
honor
Devilish
Macbeth
By
many
of
these
trains
hath
sought
to
win
me
Into
his
power
and
modest
wisdom
plucks
me
From
overcredulous
haste
But
God
above
Deal
between
thee
and
me
For
even
now
I
put
myself
to
thy
direction
and
Unspeak
mine
own
detraction
here
abjure
The
taints
and
blames
I
laid
upon
myself
For
strangers
to
my
nature
I
am
yet
Unknown
to
woman
never
was
forsworn
Scarcely
have
coveted
what
was
mine
own
At
no
time
broke
my
faith
would
not
betray
The
devil
to
his
fellow
and
delight
No
less
in
truth
than
life
My
first
false
speaking
Was
this
upon
myself
What
I
am
truly
Is
thine
and
my
poor
countrys
to
command
Whither
indeed
before
thy
hereapproach
Old
Siward
with
ten
thousand
warlike
men
Already
at
a
point
was
setting
forth
Now
well
together
and
the
chance
of
goodness
Be
like
our
warranted
quarrel
Why
are
you
silent
Such
welcome
and
unwelcome
things
at
once
Tis
hard
to
reconcile
Enter
a
Doctor
Well
more
anon
Comes
the
King
forth
I
pray
you
Ay
sir
there
are
a
crew
of
wretched
souls
That
stay
his
cure
Their
malady
convinces
The
great
assay
of
art
but
at
his
touch
Such
sanctity
hath
heaven
given
his
hand
They
presently
amend
I
thank
you
Doctor
Whats
the
disease
he
means
Tis
calld
the
evil
most
miraculous
work
in
this
good
King
Which
often
since
my
hereremain
in
England
I
have
seen
him
do
How
he
solicits
heaven
Himself
best
knows
but
strangelyvisited
people
All
swoln
and
ulcerous
pitiful
to
the
eye
The
mere
despair
of
surgery
he
cures
Hanging
a
golden
stamp
about
their
necks
Put
on
with
holy
prayers
and
tis
spoken
To
the
succeeding
royalty
he
leaves
The
healing
benediction
With
this
strange
virtue
He
hath
a
heavenly
gift
of
prophecy
And
sundry
blessings
hang
about
his
throne
That
speak
him
full
of
grace
Enter
Ross
See
who
comes
here
My
countryman
but
yet
I
know
him
not
My
ever
gentle
cousin
welcome
hither
I
know
him
now
Good
God
betimes
remove
The
means
that
makes
us
strangers
Sir
amen
Stands
Scotland
where
it
did
Alas
poor
country
Almost
afraid
to
know
itself
It
cannot
Be
calld
our
mother
but
our
grave
Where
nothing
But
who
knows
nothing
is
once
seen
to
smile
Where
sighs
and
groans
and
shrieks
that
rend
the
air
Are
made
not
markd
where
violent
sorrow
seems
modern
ecstasy
The
dead
mans
knell
Is
there
scarce
askd
for
who
and
good
mens
lives
Expire
before
the
flowers
in
their
caps
Dying
or
ere
they
sicken
relation
Too
nice
and
yet
too
true
Whats
the
newest
grief
That
of
an
hours
age
doth
hiss
the
speaker
Each
minute
teems
a
new
one
How
does
my
wife
Why
well
And
all
my
children
Well
too
The
tyrant
has
not
batterd
at
their
peace
No
they
were
well
at
peace
when
I
did
leave
em
Be
not
a
niggard
of
your
speech
How
goest
When
I
came
hither
to
transport
the
tidings
Which
I
have
heavily
borne
there
ran
a
rumor
Of
many
worthy
fellows
that
were
out
Which
was
to
my
belief
witnessd
the
rather
For
that
I
saw
the
tyrants
power
afoot
Now
is
the
time
of
help
your
eye
in
Scotland
Would
create
soldiers
make
our
women
fight
To
doff
their
dire
distresses
Bet
their
comfort
We
are
coming
thither
Gracious
England
hath
Lent
us
good
Siward
and
ten
thousand
men
An
older
and
a
better
soldier
none
That
Christendom
gives
out
Would
I
could
answer
This
comfort
with
the
like
But
I
have
words
That
would
be
howld
out
in
the
desert
air
Where
hearing
should
not
latch
them
What
concern
they
The
general
cause
Or
is
it
a
feegrief
Due
to
some
single
breast
No
mind
thats
honest
But
in
it
shares
some
woe
though
the
main
part
Pertains
to
you
alone
If
it
be
mine
Keep
it
not
from
me
quickly
let
me
have
it
Let
not
your
ears
despise
my
tongue
forever
Which
shall
possess
them
with
the
heaviest
sound
That
ever
yet
they
heard
Humh
I
guess
at
it
Your
castle
is
surprised
your
wife
and
babes
Savagely
slaughterd
To
relate
the
manner
Were
on
the
quarry
of
these
murtherd
deer
To
add
the
death
of
you
Merciful
heaven
What
man
Neer
pull
your
hat
upon
your
brows
Give
sorrow
words
The
grief
that
does
not
speak
Whispers
the
oerfraught
heart
and
bids
it
break
My
children
too
Wife
children
servants
all
That
could
be
found
And
I
must
be
from
thence
My
wife
killd
too
I
have
said
Be
comforted
Lets
make
us
medicines
of
our
great
revenge
To
cure
this
deadly
grief
He
has
no
children
All
my
pretty
ones
Did
you
say
all
hellkite
All
What
all
my
pretty
chickens
and
their
dam
At
one
fell
swoop
Dispute
it
like
a
man
I
shall
do
so
But
I
must
also
feel
it
as
a
man
I
cannot
but
remember
such
things
were
That
were
most
precious
to
me
Did
heaven
look
on
And
would
not
take
their
part
Sinful
Macduff
They
were
all
struck
for
thee
Naught
that
I
am
Not
for
their
own
demerits
but
for
mine
Fell
slaughter
on
their
souls
Heaven
rest
them
now
Be
this
the
whetstone
of
your
sword
Let
grief
Convert
to
anger
blunt
not
the
heart
enrage
it
I
could
play
the
woman
with
mine
eyes
And
braggart
with
my
tongue
But
gentle
heavens
Cut
short
all
intermission
front
to
front
Bring
thou
this
fiend
of
Scotland
and
myself
Within
my
swords
length
set
him
if
he
scape
Heaven
forgive
him
too
This
tune
goes
manly
Come
go
we
to
the
King
our
power
is
ready
Our
lack
is
nothing
but
our
leave
Macbeth
Is
ripe
for
shaking
and
the
powers
above
Put
on
their
instruments
Receive
what
cheer
you
may
The
night
is
long
that
never
finds
the
day
I
Dunsinane
Anteroom
in
the
castle
Enter
a
Doctor
of
Physic
and
a
Waiting
Gentlewoman
I
have
two
nights
watched
with
you
but
can
perceive
no
truth
in
your
report
When
was
it
she
last
walked
Since
his
Majesty
went
into
the
field
have
seen
her
rise
from
her
bed
throw
her
nightgown
upon
her
unlock
her
closet
take
forth
paper
fold
it
write
upont
read
it
afterwards
seal
it
and
again
return
to
bed
yet
all
this
while
in
a
most
fast
sleep
great
perturbation
in
nature
to
receive
at
once
the
benefit
of
sleep
and
do
the
effects
of
watching
In
this
slumbery
agitation
besides
her
walking
and
other
actual
performances
what
at
any
time
have
you
heard
her
say
That
sir
which
I
will
not
report
after
her
You
may
to
me
and
tis
most
meet
you
should
Neither
to
you
nor
anyone
having
no
witness
to
confirm
my
speech
Enter
Lady
Macbeth
with
a
taper
Lo
you
here
she
comes
This
is
her
very
guise
and
upon
my
life
fast
asleep
Observe
her
stand
close
How
came
she
by
that
light
Why
it
stood
by
her
She
has
light
by
her
continually
tis
her
command
You
see
her
eyes
are
open
Ay
but
their
sense
is
shut
What
is
it
she
does
now
Look
how
she
rubs
her
hands
It
is
an
accustomed
action
with
her
to
seem
thus
washing
her
hands
I
have
known
her
continue
in
this
a
quarter
of
an
hour
Yet
heres
a
spot
Hark
she
speaks
I
will
set
down
what
comes
from
her
to
satisfy
my
remembrance
the
more
strongly
Out
damned
spot
Out
I
say
One
two
why
then
tis
time
to
dot
Hell
is
murky
Fie
my
lord
fie
soldier
and
afeard
What
need
we
fear
who
knows
it
when
none
can
call
our
power
to
account
Yet
who
would
have
thought
the
old
man
to
have
had
so
much
blood
in
him
Do
you
mark
that
The
Thane
of
Fife
had
a
wife
where
is
she
now
What
will
these
hands
neer
be
clean
No
more
o
that
my
lord
no
more
o
that
You
mar
all
with
this
starting
Go
to
go
to
you
have
known
what
you
should
not
She
has
spoke
what
she
should
not
I
am
sure
of
that
Heaven
knows
what
she
has
known
Heres
the
smell
of
the
blood
still
All
the
perfumes
of
Arabia
will
not
sweeten
this
little
hand
Oh
oh
oh
What
a
sigh
is
there
The
heart
is
sorely
charged
I
would
not
have
such
a
heart
in
my
bosom
for
the
dignity
of
the
whole
body
Well
well
well
Pray
God
it
be
sir
This
disease
is
beyond
my
practice
Yet
I
have
known
those
which
have
walked
in
their
sleep
who
have
died
holily
in
their
beds
Wash
your
hands
put
on
your
nightgown
look
not
so
pale
I
tell
you
yet
again
Banquos
buried
he
cannot
come
out
ons
grave
Even
so
To
bed
to
bed
theres
knocking
at
the
gate
Come
come
come
come
give
me
your
handWhats
done
cannot
be
undone
To
bed
to
bed
to
bed
Will
she
go
now
to
bed
Directly
Foul
whisperings
are
abroad
Unnatural
deeds
Do
breed
unnatural
troubles
infected
minds
To
their
deaf
pillows
will
discharge
their
secrets
More
needs
she
the
divine
than
the
physician
God
God
forgive
us
all
Look
after
her
Remove
from
her
the
means
of
all
annoyance
And
still
keep
eyes
upon
her
So
good
night
My
mind
she
has
mated
and
amazed
my
sight
I
think
but
dare
not
speak
Good
night
good
doctor
Bring
me
no
more
reports
let
them
fly
all
Till
Birnam
Wood
remove
to
Dunsinane
I
cannot
taint
with
fear
Whats
the
boy
Malcolm
Was
he
not
born
of
woman
The
spirits
that
know
All
mortal
consequences
have
pronounced
me
thus
Fear
not
Macbeth
no
man
thats
born
of
woman
Shall
eer
have
power
upon
thee
Then
fly
false
Thanes
And
mingle
with
the
English
epicures
The
mind
I
sway
by
and
the
heart
I
bear
Shall
never
sag
with
doubt
nor
shake
with
fear
Enter
a
Servant
The
devil
damn
thee
black
thou
creamfaced
loon
Where
gotst
thou
that
goose
look
There
is
ten
thousand
Geese
villain
Soldiers
sir
Go
prick
thy
face
and
overred
thy
fear
Thou
lilyliverd
boy
What
soldiers
patch
Death
of
thy
soul
Those
linen
cheeks
of
thine
Are
counselors
to
fear
What
soldiers
wheyface
The
English
force
so
please
you
Take
thy
face
hence
SeytonI
am
sick
at
heart
When
I
behold
Seyton
I
say
This
push
Will
cheer
me
ever
or
disseat
me
now
I
have
lived
long
enough
My
way
of
life
Is
falln
into
the
sear
the
yellow
leaf
And
that
which
should
accompany
old
age
As
honor
love
obedience
troops
of
friends
I
must
not
look
to
have
but
in
their
stead
Curses
not
loud
but
deep
mouthhonor
breath
Which
the
poor
heart
would
fain
deny
and
dare
not
Seyton
Enter
Seyton
Whats
your
gracious
pleasure
What
news
more
All
is
confirmd
my
lord
which
was
reported
Ill
fight
til
from
my
bones
my
flesh
be
hackd
Give
me
my
armor
Tis
not
needed
yet
Ill
put
it
on
Send
out
more
horses
skirr
the
country
round
Hang
those
that
talk
of
fear
Give
me
mine
armor
How
does
your
patient
doctor
Not
so
sick
my
lord
As
she
is
troubled
with
thickcoming
fancies
That
keep
her
from
her
rest
Cure
her
of
that
Canst
thou
not
minister
to
a
mind
diseased
Pluck
from
the
memory
a
rooted
sorrow
Raze
out
the
written
troubles
of
the
brain
And
with
some
sweet
oblivious
antidote
Cleanse
the
stuffd
bosom
of
that
perilous
stuff
Which
weighs
upon
the
heart
Therein
the
patient
Must
minister
to
himself
Throw
physic
to
the
dogs
Ill
none
of
it
Come
put
mine
armor
on
give
me
my
staff
Seyton
send
out
Doctor
the
Thanes
fly
from
me
Come
sir
dispatch
If
thou
couldst
doctor
cast
The
water
of
my
land
find
her
disease
And
purge
it
to
a
sound
and
pristine
health
I
would
applaud
thee
to
the
very
echo
That
should
applaud
again
Pullt
off
I
say
What
rhubarb
cyme
or
what
purgative
drug
Would
scour
these
English
hence
Hearst
thou
of
them
Ay
my
good
lord
your
royal
preparation
Makes
us
hear
something
Bring
it
after
me
I
will
not
be
afraid
of
death
and
bane
Till
Birnam
Forest
come
to
Dunsinane
Aside
Were
I
from
Dunsinane
away
and
clear
Profit
again
should
hardly
draw
me
here
Hang
out
our
banners
on
the
outward
walls
The
cry
is
still
They
come
Our
castles
strength
Will
laugh
a
siege
to
scorn
Here
let
them
lie
Till
famine
and
the
ague
eat
them
up
Were
they
not
forced
with
those
that
should
be
ours
We
might
have
met
them
dareful
beard
to
beard
And
beat
them
backward
home
cry
of
women
within
What
is
that
noise
It
is
the
cry
of
women
my
good
lord
I
have
almost
forgot
the
taste
of
fears
The
time
has
been
my
senses
would
have
coold
To
hear
a
nightshriek
and
my
fell
of
hair
Would
at
a
dismal
treatise
rouse
and
stir
As
life
were
int
I
have
suppd
full
with
horrors
Direness
familiar
to
my
slaughterous
thoughts
Cannot
once
start
me
Reenter
Seyton
Wherefore
was
that
cry
The
Queen
my
lord
is
dead
She
should
have
died
hereafter
There
would
have
been
a
time
for
such
a
word
Tomorrow
and
tomorrow
and
tomorrow
Creeps
in
this
petty
pace
from
day
to
day
To
the
last
syllable
of
recorded
time
And
all
our
yesterdays
have
lighted
fools
The
way
to
dusty
death
Out
out
brief
candle
Lifes
but
a
walking
shadow
a
poor
player
That
struts
and
frets
his
hour
upon
the
stage
And
then
is
heard
no
more
It
is
a
tale
Told
by
an
idiot
full
of
sound
and
fury
Signifying
nothing
Enter
a
Messenger
Thou
comest
to
use
thy
tongue
thy
story
quickly
Gracious
my
lord
I
should
report
that
which
I
say
I
saw
But
know
not
how
to
do
it
Well
say
sir
As
I
did
stand
my
watch
upon
the
hill
I
lookd
toward
Birnam
and
anon
methought
The
Wood
began
to
move
Liar
and
slave
Let
me
endure
your
wrath
ift
be
not
so
Within
this
three
mile
may
you
see
it
coming
I
say
a
moving
grove
If
thou
speakst
false
Upon
the
next
tree
shalt
thou
hang
alive
Till
famine
cling
thee
if
thy
speech
be
sooth
I
care
not
if
thou
dost
for
me
as
much
I
pull
in
resolution
and
begin
To
doubt
the
equivocation
of
the
fiend
That
lies
like
truth
Fear
not
till
Birnam
Wood
Do
come
to
Dunsinane
and
now
a
wood
Comes
toward
Dunsinane
Arm
arm
and
out
If
this
which
he
avouches
does
appear
There
is
nor
flying
hence
nor
tarrying
here
I
gin
to
be
aweary
of
the
sun
And
wish
the
estate
o
the
world
were
now
undone
Ring
the
alarum
bell
Blow
wind
Come
wrack
At
least
well
die
with
harness
on
our
back
They
have
tied
me
to
a
stake
I
cannot
fly
But
bearlike
I
must
fight
the
course
Whats
he
That
was
not
born
of
woman
Such
a
one
Am
I
to
fear
or
none
Enter
young
Siward
What
is
thy
name
Thoult
be
afraid
to
hear
it
No
though
thou
callst
thyself
a
hotter
name
Than
any
is
in
hell
My
names
Macbeth
The
devil
himself
could
not
pronounce
a
title
More
hateful
to
mine
ear
No
nor
more
fearful
Thou
liest
abhorred
tyrant
with
my
sword
Ill
prove
the
lie
thou
speakst
They
fight
and
young
Seward
is
slain
Thou
wast
born
of
woman
But
swords
I
smile
at
weapons
laugh
to
scorn
Brandishd
by
man
thats
of
a
woman
born
Alarums
Enter
Macduff
That
way
the
noise
is
Tyrant
show
thy
face
If
thou
best
slain
and
with
no
stroke
of
mine
My
wife
and
childrens
ghosts
will
haunt
me
still
I
cannot
strike
at
wretched
kerns
whose
arms
Are
hired
to
bear
their
staves
Either
thou
Macbeth
Or
else
my
sword
with
an
unbatterd
edge
I
sheathe
again
undeeded
There
thou
shouldst
be
By
this
great
clatter
one
of
greatest
note
Seems
bruited
Let
me
find
him
Fortune
And
more
I
beg
not
Enter
Malcolm
and
old
Siward
This
way
my
lord
the
castles
gently
renderd
The
tyrants
people
on
both
sides
do
fight
The
noble
Thanes
do
bravely
in
the
war
The
day
almost
itself
professes
yours
And
little
is
to
do
We
have
met
with
foes
That
strike
beside
us
Enter
sir
the
castle
I
would
the
friends
we
miss
were
safe
arrived
Some
must
go
off
and
yet
by
these
I
see
So
great
a
day
as
this
is
cheaply
bought
Macduff
is
missing
and
your
noble
son
Your
son
my
lord
has
paid
a
soldiers
debt
He
only
lived
but
till
he
was
a
man
The
which
no
sooner
had
his
prowess
confirmd
In
the
unshrinking
station
where
he
fought
But
like
a
man
he
died
Then
he
is
dead
Ay
and
brought
off
the
field
Your
cause
of
sorrow
Must
not
be
measured
by
his
worth
for
then
It
hath
no
end
Had
he
his
hurts
before
Ay
on
the
front
Why
then
Gods
soldier
be
he
Had
I
as
many
sons
as
I
have
hairs
I
would
not
wish
them
to
a
fairer
death
And
so
his
knell
is
knolld
Hes
worth
more
sorrow
And
that
Ill
spend
for
him
Hes
worth
no
more
They
say
he
parted
well
and
paid
his
score
And
so
God
be
with
him
Here
comes
newer
comfort
Reenter
Macduff
with
Macbeths
head
Hail
King
for
so
thou
art
Behold
where
stands
The
usurpers
cursed
head
The
time
is
free
I
see
thee
compassd
with
thy
kingdoms
pearl
That
speak
my
salutation
in
their
minds
Whose
voices
I
desire
aloud
with
mine
Hail
King
of
Scotland
Hail
King
of
Scotland
Flourish
We
shall
not
spend
a
large
expense
of
time
Before
we
reckon
with
your
several
loves
And
make
us
even
with
you
My
Thanes
and
kinsmen
Henceforth
be
Earls
the
first
that
ever
Scotland
In
such
an
honor
named
Whats
more
to
do
Which
would
be
planted
newly
with
the
time
As
calling
home
our
exiled
friends
abroad
That
fled
the
snares
of
watchful
tyranny
Producing
forth
the
cruel
ministers
Of
this
dead
butcher
and
his
fiendlike
queen
Who
as
tis
thought
by
self
and
violent
hands
Took
off
her
life
this
and
what
needful
else
That
calls
upon
us
by
the
grace
of
Grace
We
will
perform
in
measure
time
and
place
So
thanks
to
all
at
once
and
to
each
one
Whom
we
invite
to
see
us
crownd
at
Scone
Flourish
I
I
The
palace
Enter
and
Escalus
My
lord
Of
government
the
properties
to
unfold
Would
seem
in
me
t
affect
speech
and
discourse
Since
I
am
put
to
know
that
your
own
science
Exceeds
in
that
the
lists
of
all
advice
My
strength
can
give
you
then
no
more
remains
But
that
to
your
sufficiency
as
your
worth
is
able
And
let
them
work
The
nature
of
our
people
Our
citys
institutions
and
the
terms
For
common
justice
yare
as
pregnant
in
As
art
and
practice
hath
enriched
any
That
we
remember
There
is
our
commission
From
which
we
would
not
have
you
warp
Call
hither
I
say
bid
come
before
us
Angelo
What
figure
of
us
think
you
he
will
bear
For
you
must
know
we
have
with
special
soul
Elected
him
our
absence
to
supply
Lent
him
our
terror
dressd
him
with
our
love
And
given
his
deputation
all
the
organs
Of
our
own
power
What
think
you
of
it
If
any
in
Vienna
be
of
worth
To
undergo
such
ample
grace
and
honour
It
is
Lord
Angelo
Enter
Look
where
he
comes
Always
obedient
to
your
Graces
will
I
come
to
know
your
pleasure
Angelo
There
is
a
kind
of
character
in
thy
life
That
to
th
observer
doth
thy
history
Fully
unfold
Thyself
and
thy
belongings
Are
not
thine
own
so
proper
as
to
waste
Thyself
upon
thy
virtues
they
on
thee
Heaven
doth
with
us
as
we
with
torches
do
Not
light
them
for
themselves
for
if
our
virtues
Did
not
go
forth
of
us
twere
all
alike
As
if
we
had
them
not
Spirits
are
not
finely
touchd
But
to
fine
issues
nor
Nature
never
lends
The
smallest
scruple
of
her
excellence
But
like
a
thrifty
goddess
she
determines
Herself
the
glory
of
a
creditor
Both
thanks
and
use
But
I
do
bend
my
speech
To
one
that
can
my
part
in
him
advertise
Hold
therefore
Angelo
In
our
remove
be
thou
at
full
ourself
Mortality
and
mercy
in
Vienna
Live
in
thy
tongue
and
heart
Old
Escalus
Though
first
in
question
is
thy
secondary
Take
thy
commission
Now
good
my
lord
Let
there
be
some
more
test
made
of
my
metal
Before
so
noble
and
so
great
a
figure
Be
stampd
upon
it
No
more
evasion
We
have
with
a
leavend
and
prepared
choice
Proceeded
to
you
therefore
take
your
honours
Our
haste
from
hence
is
of
so
quick
condition
That
it
prefers
itself
and
leaves
unquestiond
Matters
of
needful
value
We
shall
write
to
you
As
time
and
our
concernings
shall
importune
How
it
goes
with
us
and
do
look
to
know
What
doth
befall
you
here
So
fare
you
well
To
th
hopeful
execution
do
I
leave
you
Of
your
commissions
Yet
give
leave
my
lord
That
we
may
bring
you
something
on
the
way
My
haste
may
not
admit
it
Nor
need
you
on
mine
honour
have
to
do
With
any
scruple
your
scope
is
as
mine
own
So
to
enforce
or
qualify
the
laws
As
to
your
soul
seems
good
Give
me
your
hand
Ill
privily
away
I
love
the
people
But
do
not
like
to
stage
me
to
their
eyes
Though
it
do
well
I
do
not
relish
well
Their
loud
applause
and
Aves
vehement
Nor
do
I
think
the
man
of
safe
discretion
That
does
affect
it
Once
more
fare
you
well
The
heavens
give
safety
to
your
purposes
Lead
forth
and
bring
you
back
in
happiness
I
thank
you
Fare
you
well
I
shall
desire
you
sir
to
give
me
leave
To
have
free
speech
with
you
and
it
concerns
me
To
look
into
the
bottom
of
my
place
powr
I
have
but
of
what
strength
and
nature
I
am
not
yet
instructed
Tis
so
with
me
Let
us
withdraw
together
And
we
may
soon
our
satisfaction
have
Touching
that
point
Ill
wait
upon
your
honour
monastery
Enter
and
No
holy
father
throw
away
that
thought
Believe
not
that
the
dribbling
dart
of
love
Can
pierce
a
complete
bosom
Why
I
desire
thee
To
give
me
secret
harbour
hath
a
purpose
More
grave
and
wrinkled
than
the
aims
and
ends
Of
burning
youth
May
your
Grace
speak
of
it
My
holy
sir
none
better
knows
than
you
How
I
have
ever
lovd
the
life
removed
And
held
in
idle
price
to
haunt
assemblies
Where
youth
and
cost
a
witless
bravery
keeps
I
have
deliverd
to
Lord
Angelo
man
of
stricture
and
firm
abstinence
My
absolute
power
and
place
here
in
Vienna
And
he
supposes
me
travelld
to
Poland
For
so
I
have
strewd
it
in
the
common
ear
And
so
it
is
received
Now
pious
sir
You
will
demand
of
me
why
I
do
this
Gladly
my
lord
We
have
strict
statutes
and
most
biting
laws
The
needful
bits
and
curbs
to
headstrong
steeds
Which
for
this
fourteen
years
we
have
let
slip
Even
like
an
oergrown
lion
in
a
cave
That
goes
not
out
to
prey
Now
as
fond
fathers
Having
bound
up
the
threatning
twigs
of
birch
Only
to
stick
it
in
their
childrens
sight
For
terror
not
to
use
in
time
the
rod
Becomes
more
mockd
than
feard
so
our
decrees
Dead
to
infliction
to
themselves
are
dead
And
liberty
plucks
justice
by
the
nose
The
baby
beats
the
nurse
and
quite
athwart
Goes
all
decorum
It
rested
in
your
Grace
To
unloose
this
tiedup
justice
when
you
pleasd
And
it
in
you
more
dreadful
would
have
seemd
Than
in
Lord
Angelo
I
do
fear
too
dreadful
Sith
twas
my
fault
to
give
the
people
scope
Twould
be
my
tyranny
to
strike
and
gall
them
For
what
I
bid
them
do
for
we
bid
this
be
done
When
evil
deeds
have
their
permissive
pass
And
not
the
punishment
Therefore
indeed
my
father
I
have
on
Angelo
imposd
the
office
Who
may
in
th
ambush
of
my
name
strike
home
And
yet
my
nature
never
in
the
fight
To
do
in
slander
And
to
behold
his
sway
I
will
as
twere
a
brother
of
your
order
Visit
both
prince
and
people
Therefore
I
prithee
Supply
me
with
the
habit
and
instruct
me
How
I
may
formally
in
person
bear
me
Like
a
true
friar
Moe
reasons
for
this
action
At
our
more
leisure
shall
I
render
you
Only
this
one
Lord
Angelo
is
precise
Stands
at
a
guard
with
envy
scarce
confesses
That
his
blood
flows
or
that
his
appetite
Is
more
to
bread
than
stone
Hence
shall
we
see
If
power
change
purpose
what
our
seemers
be
Hes
hearing
of
a
cause
he
will
come
straight
Ill
tell
him
of
you
Pray
you
do
His
pleasure
may
be
he
will
relent
Alas
He
hath
but
as
offended
in
a
dream
All
sects
all
ages
smack
of
this
vice
and
he
To
die
for
t
Enter
Now
whats
the
matter
Provost
Is
it
your
will
Claudio
shall
die
tomorrow
Did
not
I
tell
thee
yea
Hadst
thou
not
order
Why
dost
thou
ask
again
Lest
I
might
be
too
rash
Under
your
good
correction
I
have
seen
When
after
execution
judgment
hath
Repented
oer
his
doom
Go
to
let
that
be
mine
Do
you
your
office
or
give
up
your
place
And
you
shall
well
be
spard
I
crave
your
honours
pardon
What
shall
be
done
sir
with
the
groaning
Juliet
Shes
very
near
her
hour
Dispose
of
her
To
some
more
fitter
place
and

speed
Reenter
Here

the
sister
of
the
man

Desires

Hath

Ay

good
lord

very
virtuous
maid
And

be
shortly
of
a
sisterhood
If
not
already
Well
let
her
be
admitted
See
you
the
fornicatress
be
removd
Let
her
have
needful
but
not
lavish
means
There
shall
be

Enter
Lucio
and
Going
Save
your
honour
Stay
a
little
while
To
Yare
welcome
whats
your
will
I
am
a
woeful
suitor
to
your
honour
Please
but
your
honour
hear
me
Well
whats
your
suit
There
is
a
vice
that
most
I
do
abhor
And
most
desire
should
meet
the
blow
of
justice
For
which
I
would
not
plead
but
that
I
must
For
which
I
must
not
plead
but
that
I
am
At
war
twixt
will
and
will
not
Well
the
matter
I
have
a
brother
is
condemnd
to
die
I
do
beseech
you
let
it
be
his
fault
And
not
my
brother
Aside
Heaven
give
thee
moving
graces
Condemn
the
fault
and
not
the
actor
of
it
Why
every
faults
condemnd
ere
it
be
done
Mine
were
the
very
cipher
of
a
function
To
fine
the
faults
whose
fine
stands
in
record
And
let
go
by
the
actor
just
but
severe
law
I
had
a
brother
then
Heaven
keep
your
honour
To
Givet
not
oer
so
to
him
again
entreat
him
Kneel
down
before
him
hang
upon
his
gown
You
are
too
cold
if
you
should
need
a
pin
You
could
not
with
more
tame
a
tongue
desire
it
To
him
I
say
Must
he
needs
die
Maiden
no
remedy
Yes
I
do
think
that
you
might
pardon
him
And
neither
heaven
nor
man
grieve
at
the
mercy
I
will
not
dot
But
can
you
if
you
would
Look
what
I
will
not
that
I
cannot
do
But
might
you
dot
and
do
the
world
no
wrong
If
so
your
heart
were
touchd
with
that
remorse
As
mine
is
to
him
Hes
sentencd
tis
too
late
To
You
are
too
cold
Too
late
Why
no
I
that
do
speak
a
word
May
call
it
back
again
Well
believe
this
No
ceremony
that
to
great
ones
longs
Not
the
kings
crown
nor
the
deputed
sword
The
marshals
truncheon
nor
the
judges
robe
Become
them
with
one
half
so
good
a
grace
As
mercy
does
If
he
had
been
as
you
and
you
as
he
You
would
have
slippd
like
him
but
he
like
you
Would
not
have
been
so
stern
Pray
you
be
gone
I
would
to
heaven
I
had
your
potency
And
you
were
Isabel
Should
it
then
be
thus
No
I
would
tell
what
twere
to
be
a
judge
And
what
a
prisoner
To
Ay
touch
him
theres
the
vein
Your
brother
is
a
forfeit
of
the
law
And
you
but
waste
your
words
Alas
Alas
Why
all
the
souls
that
were
were
forfeit
once
And
He
that
might
the
vantage
best
have
took
Found
out
the
remedy
How
would
you
be
If
He
which
is
the
top
of
judgment
should
But
judge
you
as
you
are
think
on
that
And
mercy
then
will
breathe
within
your
lips
Like
man
new
made
Be
you
content
fair
maid
It
is
the
law
not
I
condemn
your
brother
Were
he
my
kinsman
brother
or
my
son
It
should
be
thus
with
him
He
must
die
tomorrow
Tomorrow
thats
sudden
Spare
him
spare
him
Hes
not
prepard
for
death
Even
for
our
kitchens
We
kill
the
fowl
of
season
shall
we
serve
heaven
With
less
respect
than
we
do
minister
To
our
gross
selves
Good
good
my
lord
bethink
you
Who
is
it
that
hath
died
for
this
offence
Theres
many
have
committed
it
Aside
Ay
well
said
The
law
hath
not
been
dead
though
it
hath
slept
Those
many
had
not
dard
to
do
that
evil
If
the
first
that
did
th
edict
infringe
Had
answerd
for
his
deed
Now
tis
awake
Takes
note
of
what
is
done
and
like
a
prophet
Looks
in
a
glass
that
shows
what
future
evils
Either
now
or
by
remissness
new
conceivd
And
so
in
progress
to
be
hatchd
and
born
Are
now
to
have
no
successive
degrees
But
here
they
live
to
end
Yet
show
some
pity
I
show
it
most
of
all
when
I
show
justice
For
then
I
pity
those
I
do
not
know
Which
a
dismissd
offence
would
after
gall
And
do
him
right
that
answering
one
foul
wrong
Lives
not
to
act
another
Be
satisfied
Your
brother
dies
tomorrow
be
content
So
you
must
be
the
first
that
gives
this
sentence
And
he
that
suffers
it
is
excellent
To
have
a
giants
strength
But
it
is
tyrannous
To
use
it
like
a
giant
To
Thats
well
said
Could
great
men
thunder
As
Jove
himself
does
Jove
would
never
be
quiet
For
every
pelting
petty
officer
Would
use
his
heaven
for
thunder
Nothing
but
thunder
Merciful
Heaven
Thou
rather
with
thy
sharp
and
sulphurous
bolt
Splits
the
unwedgeable
and
gnarled
oak
Than
the
soft
myrtle
But
man
proud
man
Dressd
in
a
little
brief
authority
Most
ignorant
of
what
hes
most
assurd
His
glassy
essence
like
an
angry
ape
Plays
such
fantastic
tricks
before
high
heaven
As
makes
the
angels
weep
who
with
our
speens
Would
all
themselves
laugh
mortal
To
to
him
to
him
wench
He
will
relent
Hes
coming
I
perceive
t
Aside
Pray
heaven
she
win
him
We
cannot
weigh
our
brother
with
ourself
Great
men
may
jest
with
saints
tis
wit
in
them
But
in
the
less
foul
profanation
To
Thourt
i
th
right
girl
more
o
that
That
in
the
captains
but
a
choleric
word
Which
in
the
soldier
is
flat
blasphemy
To
Art
avisd
o
that
More
ont
Why
do
you
put
these
sayings
upon
me
Because
authority
though
it
err
like
others
Hath
yet
a
kind
of
medicine
in
itself
That
skins
the
vice
o
th
top
Go
to
your
bosom
Knock
there
and
ask
your
heart
what
it
doth
know
Thats
like
my
brothers
fault
If
it
confess
natural
guiltiness
such
as
is
his
Let
it
not
sound
a
thought
upon
your
tongue
Against
my
brothers
life
Aside
She
speaks
and
tis
Such
sense
that
my
sense
breeds
with
it
Fare
you
well
Gentle
my
lord
turn
back
I
will
bethink
me
Come
again
tomorrow
Hark
how
Ill
bribe
you
good
my
lord
turn
back
How
bribe
me
Ay
with
such
gifts
that
heaven
shall
share
with
you
To
You
had
marrd
all
else
Not
with
fond
sicles
of
the
tested
gold
Or
stones
whose
rate
are
either
rich
or
poor
As
fancy
values
them
but
with
true
prayers
That
shall
be
up
at
heaven
and
enter
there
Ere
sunrise
prayers
from
preserved
souls
From
fasting
maids
whose
minds
are
dedicate
To
nothing
temporal
Well
come
to
me
tomorrow
To
Go
to
tis
well
away
Heaven
keep
your
honour
safe
Aside
Amen
for
I
Am
that
way
going
to
temptation
Where
prayers
cross
At
what
hour
tomorrow
Shall
I
attend
your
lordship
At
any
time
fore
noon
Save
your
honour
From
thee
even
from
thy
virtue
Whats
this
whats
this
Is
this
her
fault
or
mine
The
tempter
or
the
tempted
who
sins
most
Ha
Not
she
nor
doth
she
tempt
but
it
is
I
That
lying
by
the
violet
in
the
sun
Do
as
the
carrion
does
not
as
the
flowr
Corrupt
with
virtuous
season
Can
it
be
That
modesty
may
more
betray
our
sense
Than
womans
lightness
Having
waste
ground
enough
Shall
we
desire
to
raze
the
sanctuary
And
pitch
our
evils
there
fie
fie
fie
What
dost
thou
or
what
art
thou
Angelo
Dost
thou
desire
her
foully
for
those
things
That
make
her
good
let
her
brother
live
Thieves
for
their
robbery
have
authority
When
judges
steal
themselves
What
do
I
love
her
That
I
desire
to
hear
her
speak
again
And
feast
upon
her
eyes
What
ist
I
dream
on
cunning
enemy
that
to
catch
a
saint
With
saints
dost
bait
thy
hook
Most
dangerous
Is
that
temptation
that
doth
goad
us
on
To
sin
in
loving
virtue
Never
could
the
strumpet
With
all
her
double
vigour
art
and
nature
Once
stir
my
temper
but
this
virtuous
maid
Subdues
me
quite
Ever
till
now
When
men
were
fond
I
smild
and
wondred
how
house
Enter
When
I
would
pray
and
think
I
think
and
pray
To
several
subjects
Heaven
hath
my
empty
words
Whilst
my
invention
hearing
not
my
tongue
Anchors
on
Isabel
Heaven
in
my
mouth
As
if
I
did
but
only
chew
his
name
And
in
my
heart
the
strong
and
swelling
evil
Of
my
conception
The
state
whereon
I
studied
Is
like
a
good
thing
being
often
read
Grown
sere
and
tedious
yea
my
gravity
Wherein
let
no
man
hear
me
I
take
pride
Could
I
with
boot
change
for
an
idle
plume
Which
the
air
beats
for
vain
place
form
How
often
dost
thou
with
thy
case
thy
habit
Wrench
awe
from
fools
and
tie
the
wiser
souls
To
thy
false
seeming
Blood
thou
art
blood
Lets
write
good
angel
on
the
devils
horn
Tis
not
the
devils
crest
Enter
How
now
whos
there
One
Isabel
a
sister
desires
access
to
you
Teach
her
the
way
Why
does
my
blood
thus
muster
to
my
heart
Making
both
it
unable
for
itself
And
dispossessing
all
my
other
parts
Of
necessary
fitness
So
play
the
foolish
throngs
with
one
that
swoons
Come
all
to
help
him
and
so
stop
the
air
By
which
he
should
revive
and
even
so
The
general
subject
to
a
wellwishd
king
Quit
their
own
part
and
in
obsequious
fondness
Crowd
to
his
presence
where
their
untaught
love
Must
needs
appear
offence
Enter
How
now
fair
maid
I
am
come
to
know
your
pleasure
That
you
might
know
it
would
much
better
please
me
Than
to
demand
what
tis
Your
brother
cannot
live
Even
so
Heaven
keep
your
honour
Yet
may
he
live
awhile
and
it
may
be
As
long
as
you
or
I
yet
he
must
die
Under
your
sentence
Yea
When
I
beseech
you
that
in
his
reprieve
Longer
or
shorter
he
may
be
so
fitted
That
his
soul
sicken
not
Ha
Fie
these
filthy
vices
It
were
as
good
To
pardon
him
that
hath
from
nature
stoln
man
already
made
as
to
remit
Their
saucy
sweetness
that
do
coin
heavens
image
In
stamps
that
are
forbid
tis
all
as
easy
Falsely
to
take
away
a
life
true
made
As
to
put
metal
in
restrained
means
To
make
a
false
one
Tis
set
down
so
in
heaven
but
not
in
earth
Say
you
so
Then
I
shall
pose
you
quickly
Which
had
you
rather
that
the
most
just
law
Now
took
your
brothers
life
or
to
redeem
him
Give
up
your
body
to
such
sweet
uncleanness
As
she
that
he
hath
staind
Sir
believe
this
I
had
rather
give
my
body
than
my
soul
I
talk
not
of
your
soul
our
compelld
sins
Stand
more
for
number
than
for
accompt
How
say
you
Nay
Ill
not
warrant
that
for
I
can
speak
Against
the
thing
I
say
Answer
to
this
I
now
the
voice
of
the
recorded
law
Pronounce
a
sentence
on
your
brothers
life
Might
there
not
be
a
charity
in
sin
To
save
this
brothers
life
Please
you
to
dot
Ill
take
it
as
a
peril
to
my
soul
It
is
no
sin
at
all
but
charity
Pleasd
you
to
dot
at
peril
of
your
soul
Were
equal
poise
of
sin
and
charity
That
I
do
beg
his
life
if
it
be
sin
Heaven
let
me
bear
it
You
granting
of
my
suit
If
that
be
sin
Ill
make
it
my
morn
prayer
To
have
it
added
to
the
faults
of
mine
And
nothing
of
your
answer
Nay
but
hear
me
Your
sense
pursues
not
mine
either
you
are
ignorant
Or
seem
so
craftily
and
thats
not
good
Let
me
be
ignorant
and
in
nothing
good
But
graciously
to
know
I
am
no
better
Thus
wisdom
wishes
to
appear
most
bright
When
it
doth
tax
itself
as
these
black
masks
Proclaim
an
enshielded
beauty
ten
times
louder
Than
beauty
could
displayd
But
mark
me
To
be
received
plain
Ill
speak
more
gross
Your
brother
is
to
die
So
And
his
offence
is
so
as
it
appears
Accountant
to
the
law
upon
that
pain
True
Admit
no
other
way
to
save
his
life
As
I
subscribe
not
that
nor
any
other
But
in
the
loss
of
question
that
you
his
sister
Finding
yourself
desird
of
such
a
person
Whose
credit
with
the
judge
or
own
great
place
Could
fetch
your
brother
from
the
manacles
Of
the
allbinding
law
and
that
there
were
No
earthly
mean
to
save
him
but
that
either
You
must
lay
down
the
treasures
of
your
body
To
this
supposed
or
else
to
let
him
suffer
What
would
you
do
As
much
for
my
poor
brother
as
myself
That
is
were
I
under
the
terms
of
death
Th
impression
of
keen
whips
Id
wear
as
rubies
And
strip
myself
to
death
as
to
a
bed
That
longing
have
been
sick
for
ere
Id
yield
My
body
up
to
shame
Then
must
your
brother
die
And
twere
the
cheaper
way
Better
it
were
a
brother
died
at
once
Than
that
a
sister
by
redeeming
him
Should
die
for
ever
Were
not
you
then
as
cruel
as
the
sentence
That
you
have
slanderd
so
Ignominy
in
ransom
and
free
pardon
Are
of
two
houses
lawful
mercy
Is
nothing
kin
to
foul
redemption
You
seemd
of
late
to
make
the
law
a
tyrant
And
rather
provd
the
sliding
of
your
brother
merriment
than
a
vice
pardon
me
my
lord
It
oft
falls
out
To
have
what
we
would
have
we
speak
not
what
we
mean
I
something
do
excuse
the
thing
I
hate
For
his
advantage
that
I
dearly
love
We
are
all
frail
Else
let
my
brother
die
If
not
a
fedary
but
only
he
Owe
and
succeed
thy
weakness
Nay
women
are
frail
too
Ay
as
the
glasses
where
they
view
themselves
Which
are
as
easy
broke
as
they
make
forms
Women
help
heaven
Men
their
creation
mar
In
profiting
by
them
Nay
call
us
ten
times
frail
For
we
are
soft
as
our
complexions
are
And
credulous
to
false
prints
I
think
it
well
And
from
this
testimony
of
your
own
sex
Since
I
suppose
we
are
made
to
be
no
stronger
Than
faults
may
shake
our
frames
let
me
be
bold
I
do
arrest
your
words
Be
that
you
are
That
is
a
woman
if
you
be
more
youre
none
If
you
be
one
as
you
are
well
expressd
By
all
external
warrants
show
it
now
By
putting
on
the
destind
livery
I
have
no
tongue
but
one
gentle
my
lord
Let
me
intreat
you
speak
the
former
language
Plainly
conceive
I
love
you
My
brother
did
love
Juliet
And
you
tell
me
that
he
shall
die
fort
He
shall
not
Isabel
if
you
give
me
love
I
know
your
virtue
hath
a
license
int
Which
seems
a
little
fouler
than
it
is
To
pluck
on
others
Believe
me
on
mine
honour
My
words
express
my
purpose
Ha
little
honour
to
be
much
believd
And
most
pernicious
purpose
Seeming
seeming
I
will
proclaim
thee
Angelo
look
fort
Sign
me
a
present
pardon
for
my
brother
Or
with
an
outstretchd
throat
Ill
tell
the
world
aloud
What
man
thou
art
Who
will
believe
thee
Isabel
My
unsoild
name
th
austereness
of
my
life
My
vouch
against
you
and
my
place
i
th
state
Will
so
your
accusation
overweigh
That
you
shall
stifle
in
your
own
report
And
smell
of
calumny
I
have
begun
And
now
I
give
my
sensual
race
the
rein
Fit
thy
consent
to
my
sharp
appetite
Lay
by
all
nicety
and
prolixious
blushes
That
banish
what
they
sue
for
redeem
thy
brother
By
yielding
up
thy
body
to
my
will
Or
else
he
must
not
only
die
the
death
But
thy
unkindness
shall
his
death
draw
out
To
lingring
sufferance
Answer
me
tomorrow
Or
by
the
affection
that
now
guides
me
most
Ill
prove
a
tyrant
to
him
As
for
you
Say
what
you
can
my
false
oerweighs
your
true
To
whom
should
I
complain
Did
I
tell
this
Who
would
believe
me
perilous
mouths
That
bear
in
them
one
and
the
selfsame
tongue
Either
of
condemnation
or
approof
Bidding
the
law
make
curtsy
to
their
will
Hooking
both
right
and
wrong
to
th
appetite
To
follow
as
it
draws
Ill
to
my
brother
Though
he
hath
falln
by
prompture
of
the
blood
Yet
hath
he
in
him
such
a
mind
of
honour
That
had
he
twenty
heads
to
tender
down
On
twenty
bloody
blocks
hed
yield
them
up
Before
his
sister
should
her
body
stoop
To
such
abhorrd
pollution
Then
Isabel
live
chaste
and
brother
die
More
than
our
brother
is
our
chastity
Ill
tell
him
yet
of
Angelos
request
And
fit
his
mind
to
death
for
his
souls
rest
I
The
prison
Enter
disguised
as
before
and
So
then
you
hope
of
pardon
from
Lord
Angelo
The
miserable
have
no
other
medicine
But
only
hope
I
have
hope
to
Eve
and
am
prepard
to
die
Be
absolute
for
death
either
death
or
life
Shall
thereby
be
the
sweeter
Reason
thus
with
life
If
I
do
lose
thee
I
do
lose
a
thing
That
none
but
fools
would
keep
breath
thou
art
Servile
to
all
the
skyey
influences
That
dost
this
habitation
where
thou
keepst
Hourly
afflict
Merely
thou
art
Deaths
fool
For
him
thou
labourst
by
thy
flight
to
shun
And
yet
runst
toward
him
still
Thou
art
not
noble
For
all
th
accommodations
that
thou
bearst
Are
nursd
by
baseness
Thou
rt
by
no
means
valiant
For
thou
dost
fear
the
soft
and
tender
fork
Of
a
poor
worm
Thy
best
of
rest
is
sleep
And
that
thou
oft
provokst
yet
grossly
fearst
Thy
death
which
is
no
more
Thou
art
not
thyself
For
thou
exists
on
many
a
thousand
grains
That
issue
out
of
dust
Happy
thou
art
not
For
what
thou
hast
not
still
thou
strivst
to
get
And
what
thou
hast
forgetst
Thou
art
not
certain
For
thy
complexion
shifts
to
strange
effects
After
the
moon
If
thou
art
rich
thourt
poor
For
like
an
ass
whose
back
with
ingots
bows
Thou
bearst
thy
heavy
riches
but
a
journey
And
Death
unloads
thee
Friend
hast
thou
none
For
thine
own
bowels
which
do
call
thee
sire
The
mere
effusion
of
thy
proper
loins
Do
curse
the
gout
serpigo
and
the
rheum
For
ending
thee
no
sooner
Thou
hast
nor
youth
nor
age
But
as
it
were
an
afterdinners
sleep
Dreaming
on
both
for
all
thy
blessed
youth
Becomes
as
aged
and
doth
beg
the
alms
Of
palsied
eld
and
when
thou
art
old
and
rich
Thou
hast
neither
heat
affection
limb
nor
beauty
To
make
thy
riches
pleasant
Whats
yet
in
this
That
bears
the
name
of
life
Yet
in
this
life
Lie
hid
moe
thousand
deaths
yet
death
we
fear
That
makes
these
odds
all
even
I
humbly
thank
you
To
sue
to
live
I
find
I
seek
to
die
And
seeking
death
find
life
Let
it
come
on
Within
What
ho
Peace
here
grace
and
good
company
Whos
there
Come
in
the
wish
deserves
a
welcome
Dear
sir
ere
long
Ill
visit
you
again
Most
holy
sir
I
thank
you
Enter
My
business
is
a
word
or
two
with
Claudio
And
very
welcome
Look
signior
heres
your
sister
Provost
a
word
with
you
As
many
as
you
please
Bring
me
to
hear
them
speak
where
I
may
be
conceald
Now
sister
whats
the
comfort
Why
As
all
comforts
are
most
good
most
good
indeed
Lord
Angelo
having
affairs
to
heaven
Intends
you
for
his
swift
ambassador
Where
you
shall
be
an
everlasting
leiger
Therefore
your
best
appointment
make
with
speed
Tomorrow
you
set
on
Is
there
no
remedy
None
but
such
remedy
as
to
save
a
head
To
cleave
a
heart
in
twain
But
is
there
any
Yes
brother
you
may
live
There
is
a
devilish
mercy
in
the
judge
If
youll
implore
it
that
will
free
your
life
But
fetter
you
till
death
Perpetual
durance
Ay
just
perpetual
durance
a
restraint
Though
all
the
worlds
vastidity
you
had
To
a
determind
scope
But
in
what
nature
In
such
a
one
as
you
consenting
tot
Would
bark
your
honour
from
that
trunk
you
bear
And
leave
you
naked
Let
me
know
the
point
I
do
fear
thee
Claudio
and
I
quake
Lest
thou
a
feverous
life
shouldst
entertain
And
six
or
seven
winters
more
respect
Than
a
perpetual
honour
Darst
thou
die
The
sense
of
death
is
most
in
apprehension
And
the
poor
beetle
that
we
tread
upon
In
corporal
sufferance
finds
a
pang
as
great
As
when
a
giant
dies
Why
give
you
me
this
shame
Think
you
I
can
a
resolution
fetch
From
flowry
tenderness
If
I
must
die
I
will
encounter
darkness
as
a
bride
And
hug
it
in
mine
arms
There
spake
my
brother
there
my
fathers
grave
Did
utter
forth
a
voice
Yes
thou
must
die
Thou
art
too
noble
to
conserve
a
life
In
base
appliances
This
outwardsainted
deputy
Whose
settled
visage
and
deliberate
word
Nips
youth
i
th
head
and
follies
doth
enew
As
falcon
doth
the
fowl
is
yet
a
devil
His
filth
within
being
cast
he
would
appear
pond
as
deep
as
hell
The
precise
Angelo
tis
the
cunning
livery
of
hell
The
damnedst
body
to
invest
and
cover
In
precise
guards
Dost
thou
think
Claudio
If
I
would
yield
him
my
virginity
Thou
mightst
be
freed
heavens
it
cannot
be
Yes
he
would
givet
thee
from
this
rank
offence
So
to
offend
him
still
This
nights
the
time
That
I
should
do
what
I
abhor
to
name
Or
else
thou
diest
tomorrow
Thou
shalt
not
dot
were
it
but
my
life
Id
throw
it
down
for
your
deliverance
As
frankly
as
a
pin
Thanks
dear
Isabel
Be
ready
Claudio
for
your
death
tomorrow
Yes
Has
he
affections
in
him
That
thus
can
make
him
bite
the
law
by
th
nose
When
he
would
force
it
Sure
it
is
no
sin
Or
of
the
deadly
seven
it
is
the
least
Which
is
the
least
If
it
were
damnable
he
being
so
wise
Why
would
he
for
the
momentary
trick
Be
perdurably
find
Isabel
What
says
my
brother
Death
is
a
fearful
thing
And
shamed
life
a
hateful
Ay
but
to
die
and
go
we
know
not
where
To
lie
in
cold
obstruction
and
to
rot
This
sensible
warm
motion
to
become
kneaded
clod
and
the
delighted
spirit
To
bathe
in
fiery
floods
or
to
reside
In
thrilling
region
of
thickribbed
ice
To
be
imprisond
in
the
viewless
winds
And
blown
with
restless
violence
round
about
The
pendent
world
or
to
be
worse
than
worst
Of
those
that
lawless
and
incertain
thought
Imagine
howling
tis
too
horrible
The
weariest
and
most
loathed
worldly
life
That
age
ache
penury
and
imprisonment
Can
lay
on
nature
is
a
paradise
To
what
we
fear
of
death
Alas
alas
Sweet
sister
let
me
live
What
sin
you
do
to
save
a
brothers
life
Nature
dispenses
with
the
deed
so
far
That
it
becomes
a
virtue
you
beast
faithless
coward
dishonest
wretch
Wilt
thou
be
made
a
man
out
of
my
vice
Ist
not
a
kind
of
incest
to
take
life
From
thine
own
sisters
shame
What
should
I
think
Heaven
shield
my
mother
playd
my
father
fair
For
such
a
warped
slip
of
wilderness
Neer
issud
from
his
blood
Take
my
defiance
Die
perish
Might
but
my
bending
down
Reprieve
thee
from
thy
fate
it
should
proceed
Ill
pray
a
thousand
prayers
for
thy
death
No
word
to
save
thee
Nay
hear
me
Isabel
fie
fie
fie
Thy
sins
not
accidental
but
a
trade
Mercy
to
thee
would
prove
itself
a
bawd
Tis
best
that
thou
diest
quickly
hear
me
Isabella
Reenter
Vouchsafe
a
word
young
sister
but
one
word
What
is
your
will
Might
you
dispense
with
your
leisure
I
would
by
and
by
have
some
speech
with
you
the
satisfaction
I
would
require
is
likewise
your
own
benefit
I
have
no
superfluous
leisure
my
stay
must
be
stolen
out
of
other
affairs
but
I
will
attend
you
awhile
Walks
apart
Son
I
have
overheard
what
hath
passd
between
you
and
your
sister
Angelo
had
never
the
purpose
to
corrupt
her
only
he
hath
made
an
assay
of
her
virtue
to
practise
his
judgment
with
the
disposition
of
natures
She
having
the
truth
of
honour
in
her
hath
made
him
that
gracious
denial
which
he
is
most
glad
to
receive
I
am
confessor
to
Angelo
and
I
know
this
to
be
true
therefore
prepare
yourself
to
death
Do
not
satisfy
your
resolution
with
hopes
that
are
fallible
tomorrow
you
must
die
go
to
your
knees
and
make
ready
Let
me
ask
my
sister
pardon
I
am
so
out
of
love
with
life
that
I
will
sue
to
be
rid
of
it
Hold
you
there
Farewell
you
Reenter
Whats
your
will
father
That
now
you
are
come
you
will
be
gone
Leave
me
a
while
with
the
maid
my
mind
promises
with
my
habit
no
loss
shall
touch
her
by
my
company
In
good
time
The
hand
that
hath
made
you
fair
hath
made
you
good
the
goodness
that
is
cheap
in
beauty
makes
beauty
brief
in
goodness
but
grace
being
the
soul
of
your
complexion
shall
keep
the
body
of
it
ever
fair
The
assault
that
Angelo
hath
made
to
you
fortune
hath
conveyd
to
my
understanding
and
but
that
frailty
hath
examples
for
his
falling
I
should
wonder
at
Angelo
How
will
you
do
to
content
this
substitute
and
to
save
your
brother
I
am
now
going
to
resolve
him
I
had
rather
my
brother
die
by
the
law
than
my
son
should
be
unlawfully
born
But
how
much
is
the
good
Duke
deceivd
in
Angelo
If
ever
he
return
and
I
can
speak
to
him
I
will
open
my
lips
in
vain
or
discover
his
government
That
shall
not
be
much
amiss
yet
as
the
matter
now
stands
he
will
avoid
your
accusation
he
made
trial
of
you
only
Therefore
fasten
your
ear
on
my
advisings
to
the
love
I
have
in
doing
good
a
remedy
presents
itself
I
do
make
myself
believe
that
you
may
most
uprighteously
do
a
poor
wronged
lady
a
merited
benefit
redeem
your
brother
from
the
angry
law
do
no
stain
to
your
own
gracious
person
and
much
please
the
absent
Duke
if
peradventure
he
shall
ever
return
to
have
hearing
of
this
business
Let
me
hear
you
speak
farther
I
have
spirit
to
do
anything
that
appears
not
foul
in
the
truth
of
my
spirit
Virtue
is
bold
and
goodness
never
fearful
Have
you
not
heard
speak
of
Mariana
the
sister
of
Frederick
the
great
soldier
who
miscarried
at
sea
I
have
heard
of
the
lady
and
good
words
went
with
her
name
She
should
this
Angelo
have
married
was
affianced
to
her
by
oath
and
the
nuptial
appointed
between
which
time
of
the
contract
and
limit
of
the
solemnity
her
brother
Frederick
was
wreckd
at
sea
having
in
that
perished
vessel
the
dowry
of
his
sister
But
mark
how
heavily
this
befell
to
the
poor
gentlewoman
there
she
lost
a
noble
and
renowned
brother
in
his
love
toward
her
ever
most
kind
and
natural
with
him
the
portion
and
sinew
of
her
fortune
her
marriagedowry
with
both
her
combinate
husband
this
wellseeming
Angelo
Can
this
be
so
Did
Angelo
so
leave
her
Left
her
in
her
tears
and
dried
not
one
of
them
with
his
comfort
swallowed
his
vows
whole
pretending
in
her
discoveries
of
dishonour
in
few
bestowd
her
on
her
own
lamentation
which
she
yet
wears
for
his
sake
and
he
a
marble
to
her
tears
is
washed
with
them
but
relents
not
What
a
merit
were
it
in
death
to
take
this
poor
maid
from
the
world
What
corruption
in
this
life
that
it
will
let
this
man
live
But
how
out
of
this
can
she
avail
It
is
a
rupture
that
you
may
easily
heal
and
the
cure
of
it
not
only
saves
your
brother
but
keeps
you
from
dishonour
in
doing
it
Show
me
how
good
father
This
forenamed
maid
hath
yet
in
her
the
continuance
of
her
first
affection
his
unjust
unkindness
that
in
all
reason
should
have
quenched
her
love
hath
like
an
impediment
in
the
current
made
it
more
violent
and
unruly
Go
you
to
Angelo
answer
his
requiring
with
a
plausible
obedience
agree
with
his
demands
to
the
point
only
refer
yourself
to
this
advantage
first
that
your
stay
with
him
may
not
be
long
that
the
time
may
have
all
shadow
and
silence
in
it
and
the
place
answer
to
convenience
This
being
granted
in
course
and
now
follows
all
we
shall
advise
this
wronged
maid
to
stead
up
your
appointment
go
in
your
place
If
the
encounter
acknowledge
itself
hereafter
it
may
compel
him
to
her
recompense
and
here
by
this
is
your
brother
saved
your
honour
untainted
the
poor
Mariana
advantaged
and
the
corrupt
deputy
scaled
The
maid
will
I
frame
and
make
fit
for
his
attempt
If
you
think
well
to
carry
this
as
you
may
the
doubleness
of
the
benefit
defends
the
deceit
from
reproof
What
think
you
of
it
The
image
of
it
gives
me
content
already
and
I
trust
it
will
grow
to
a
most
prosperous
perfection
It
lies
much
in
your
holding
up
Haste
you
speedily
to
Angelo
if
for
this
night
he
entreat
you
to
his
bed
give
him
promise
of
satisfaction
I
will
presently
to
Saint
Lukes
there
at
the
moated
grange
resides
this
dejected
Mariana
At
that
place
call
upon
me
and
dispatch
with
Angelo
that
it
may
be
quickly
I
thank
you
for
this
comfort
Fare
you
well
good
father

Come

Bless

And
you
good

What
offence
hath
this
man
made
you
sir
Marry
sir
he
hath
offended
the
law
and
sir
we
take
him
to
be
a
thief
too
sir
for
we
have
found
upon
him
sir
a
strange
picklock
which
we
have
sent
to
the
deputy
Fie
sirrah
a
bawd
a
wicked
bawd
The
evil
that
thou
causest
to
be
done
That
is
thy
means

Do
thou
but
think
What
tis
to

From
such
a
filthy

From
their
abominable

beastly
touches

and
live
Canst
thou
believe
thy
living
is
a
life
So
stinkingly
depending
Go
mend
go

Indeed
it
does
stink
in
some
sort
sir
but
yet
sir
I
would
prove
Nay

proofs

Thou

Ere

He

The

cannot
abide

whoremaster
if
he
be
a
whoremonger
and
comes
before
him
he
were
as
good

That
we
were

From

How

Art

What
is
there
none
of

What

Is
the

as

Which

Is
it
sad

The
trick

Still

thus
still
worse
How
doth

Procures

Troth
sir
she
hath

Why

good
it
is
the
right
of

it
must
be
so
ever
your
fresh

and
your

Art
going

Pompey
Yes
faith
sir
Why
tis
not
amiss
Pompey
Farewell
go
say
I
sent
thee
thither
For
debt
Pompey
or
how
For
being
a
bawd
for
being
a
bawd
Well
then
imprison
him
If
imprisonment
be
the
due
of
a
bawd
why
tis
his

Bawd
is
he
doubtless
and
of
antiquity
too
bawdborn
Farewell
good
Pompey
Commend
me
to
the
prison
Pompey
You
will
turn
good
husband
now
Pompey
you
will
keep
the
house
I
hope
sir
your
good
worship
will
be
my
bail
No
indeed
will
I
not
Pompey
it
is
not

wear
I
will
pray
Pompey
to
increase
your
bondage
If
you
take
it
not
patiently
why
your
mettle
is

more
Adieu
trusty
Pompey
Bless
you
friar
And

Does
Bridget

Pompey

Come
your
ways
sir
come
You
will
not
bail
me
then
sir
Then
Pompey
nor
now
What
news
abroad
friar
what
news
Come
your
ways
sir
come
Go
to
kennel
Pompey
go
What
news
friar
of
the
Duke
I
know
none
Can
you
tell
me
of
any
Some
say
he
is
with
the
Emperor
of
Russia
other
some
he
is
in
Rome
but
where
is
he
think
you
I
know
not
where
but
wheresoever
I
wish
him
well
It
was
a
mad
fantastical
trick
of
him
to
steal
from
the
state
and
usurp
the
beggary
he
was
never
born
to
Lord
Angelo
dukes
it
well
in
his
absence
he
puts
transgression
tot
He
does
well
int
little
more
lenity
to
lechery
would
do
no
harm
in
him
something
too
crabbed
that
way
friar
It
is
too
general
a
vice
and
severity
must
cure
it
Yes
in
good
sooth
the
vice
is
of
a
great
kindred
it
is
well
allied
but
it
is
impossible
to
extirp
it
quite
friar
till
eating
and
drinking
be
put
down
They
say
this
Angelo
was
not
made
by
man
and
woman
after
this
downright
way
of
creation
Is
it
true
think
you
How
should
he
be
made
then
Some
report
a
seamaid
spawnd
him
some
that
he
was
begot
between
two
stockfishes
But
it
is
certain
that
when
he
makes
water
his
urine
is
congeald
ice
that
I
know
to
be
true
And
he
is
a
motion
generative
thats
infallible
You
are
pleasant
sir
and
speak
apace
Why
what
a
ruthless
thing
is
this
in
him
for
the
rebellion
of
a
codpiece
to
take
away
the
life
of
a
man
Would
the
Duke
that
is
absent
have
done
this
Ere
he
would
have
hangd
a
man
for
the
getting
a
hundred
bastards
he
would
have
paid
for
the
nursing
a
thousand
He
had
some
feeling
of
the
sport
he
knew
the
service
and
that
instructed
him
to
mercy
I
never
heard
the
absent
Duke
much
detected
for
women
he
was
not
inclind
that
way
sir
you
are
deceivd
Tis
not
possible
Who
not
the
Duke
Yes
your
beggar
of
fifty
and
his
use
was
to
put
a
ducat
in
her
clackdish
The
Duke
had
crotchets
in
him
He
would
be
drunk
too
that
let
me
inform
you
You
do
him
wrong
surely
Sir
I
was
an
inward
of
his
shy
fellow
was
the
Duke
and
I
believe
I
know
the
cause
of
his
withdrawing
What
I
prithee
might
be
the
cause
No
pardon
tis
a
secret
must
be
lockd
within
the
teeth
and
the
lips
but
this
I
can
let
you
understand
the
greater
file
of
the
subject
held
the
Duke
to
be
wise
Wise
Why
no
question
but
he
was
very
superficial
ignorant
unweighing
fellow
Either
this
is
envy
in
you
folly
or
mistaking
the
very
stream
of
his
life
and
the
business
he
hath
helmed
must
upon
a
warranted
need
give
him
a
better
proclamation
Let
him
be
but
testimonied
in
his
own
bringingsforth
and
he
shall
appear
to
the
envious
a
scholar
a
statesman
and
a
soldier
Therefore
you
speak
unskilfully
or
if
your
knowledge
be
more
it
is
much
darkned
in
your
malice
Sir
I
know
him
and
I
love
him
Love
talks
with
better
knowledge
and
knowledge
with
dearer
love
Come
sir
I
know
what
I
know
I
can
hardly
believe
that
since
you
know
not
what
you
speak
But
if
ever
the
Duke
return
as
our
prayers
are
he
may
let
me
desire
you
to
make
your
answer
before
him
If
it
be
honest
you
have
spoke
you
have
courage
to
maintain
it
I
am
bound
to
call
upon
you
and
I
pray
you
your
name
Sir
my
name
is
Lucio
well
known
to
the
Duke
He
shall
know
you
better
sir
if
I
may
live
to
report
you
I
fear
you
not
you
hope
the
Duke
will
return
no
more
or
you
imagine
me
too
unhurtful
an
opposite
But
indeed
I
can
do
you
little
harm
youll
forswear
this
again
Ill
be
hangd
first
Thou
art
deceivd
in
me
friar
But
no
more
of
this
Canst
thou
tell
if
Claudio
die
tomorrow
or
no
Why
should
he
die
sir
Why
For
filling
a
bottle
with
a
tundish
I
would
the
Duke
we
talk
of
were
returnd
again
This
ungeniturd
agent
will
unpeople
the
province
with
continency
sparrows
must
not
build
in
his
houseeaves
because
they
are
lecherous
The
Duke
yet
would
have
dark
deeds
darkly
answered
he
would
never
bring
them
to
light
Would
he
were
returnd
Marry
this
Claudio
is
condemned
for
untrussing
Farewell
good
friar
I
prithee
pray
for
me
The
Duke
I
say
to
thee
again
would
eat
mutton
on
Fridays
Hes
not
past
it
yet
and
I
say
to
thee
he
would
mouth
with
a
beggar
though
she
smelt
brown
bread
and
garlic
Say
that
I
said
so
Farewell
No
might
nor
greatness
in
mortality
Can
censure
scape
backwounding
calumny
The
whitest
virtue
strikes
What
king
so
strong
Can
tie
the
gall
up
in
the
slanderous
tongue
But
who
comes
here
Enter
and
with
Go
away
with
her
to
prison
Good
my
lord
be
good
to
me
your
honour
is
accounted
a
merciful
man
good
my
lord
Double
and
treble
admonition
and
still
forfeit
in
the
same
kind
This
would
make
mercy
swear
and
play
the
tyrant
bawd
of
eleven
years
continuance
may
it
please
your
honour
My
lord
this
is
one
Lucios
information
against
me
Mistress
Kate
Keepdown
was
with
child
by
him
in
the
Dukes
time
he
promisd
her
marriage
His
child
is
a
year
and
a
quarter
old
come
Philip
and
Jacob
I
have
kept
it
myself
and
see
how
he
goes
about
to
abuse
me
That
fellow
is
a
fellow
of
much
license
Let
him
be
calld
before
us
Away
with
her
to
prison
Go
to
no
more
words
with
Provost
my
brother
Angelo
will
not
be
alterd
Claudio
must
die
tomorrow
Let
him
be
furnishd
with
divines
and
have
all
charitable
preparation
If
my
brother
wrought
by
my
pity
it
should
not
be
so
with
him
So
please
you
this
friar
hath
been
with
him
and
advisd
him
for
th
entertainment
of
death
Good
even
good
father
Bliss
and
goodness
on
you
Of
whence
are
you
Not
of
this
country
though
my
chance
is
now
To
use
it
for
my
time
I
am
a
brother
Of
gracious
order
late
come
from
the
See
In
special
business
from
his
Holiness
What
news
abroad
i
th
world
None
but
that
there
is
so
great
a
fever
on
goodness
that
the
dissolution
of
it
must
cure
it
Novelty
is
only
in
request
and
as
it
is
as
dangerous
to
be
aged
in
any
kind
of
course
as
it
is
virtuous
to
be
constant
in
any
undertakeing
There
is
scarce
truth
enough
alive
to
make
societies
secure
but
security
enough
to
make
fellowships
accurst
Much
upon
this
riddle
runs
the
wisdom
of
the
world
This
news
is
old
enough
yet
it
is
every
days
news
I
pray
you
sir
of
what
disposition
was
the
Duke
One
that
above
all
other
strifes
contended
especially
to
know
himself
What
pleasure
was
he
given
to
Rather
rejoicing
to
see
another
merry
than
merry
at
anything
which
professd
to
make
him
rejoice
a
gentleman
of
all
temperance
But
leave
we
him
to
his
events
with
a
prayer
they
may
prove
prosperous
and
let
me
desire
to
know
how
you
find
Claudio
prepard
I
am
made
to
understand
that
you
have
lent
him
visitation
He
professes
to
have
received
no
sinister
measure
from
his
judge
but
most
willingly
humbles
himself
to
the
determination
of
justice
Yet
had
he
framed
to
himself
by
the
instruction
of
his
frailty
many
deceiving
promises
of
life
which
I
by
my
good
leisure
have
discredited
to
him
and
now
he
is
resolvd
to
die
You
have
paid
the
heavens
your
function
and
the
prisoner
the
very
debt
of
your
calling
I
have
labourd
for
the
poor
gentleman
to
the
extremest
shore
of
my
modesty
but
my
brother
justice
have
I
found
so
severe
that
he
hath
forcd
me
to
tell
him
he
is
indeed
Justice
If
his
own
life
answer
the
straitness
of
his
proceeding
it
shall
become
him
well
wherein
if
he
chance
to
fail
he
hath
sentencd
himself
I
am
going
to
visit
the
prisoner
Fare
you
well
Peace
be
with
you
He
who
the
sword
of
heaven
will
bear
Should
be
as
holy
as
severe
Pattern
in
himself
to
know
Grace
to
stand
and
virtue
go
More
nor
less
to
others
paying
Than
by
selfoffences
weighing
Shame
to
him
whose
cruel
striking
Kills
for
faults
of
his
own
liking
Twice
treble
shame
on
Angelo
To
weed
my
vice
and
let
his
grow
what
may
man
within
him
hide
Though
angel
on
the
outward
side
How
may
likeness
made
in
crimes
Make
a
practice
on
the
times
To
draw
with
idle
spiders
strings
Most
ponderous
and
substantial
things
Craft
against
vice
I
must
apply
With
Angelo
tonight
shall
lie
His
old
betrothed
but
despised
So
disguise
shall
by
th
disguised
Pay
with

The

at
Saint
Dukes
Enter
and
singing
Take
take
those
lips
away
That
so
sweetly
were
forsworn
And
those
eyes
the
break
of
day
Lights
that
do

But
my
kisses

Seals

Enter

Break
off
thy

and
haste
thee
quick
away
Here
comes
a
man
of
comfort
whose
advice
Hath
often
stilld
my
brawling
discontent
I
cry
you
mercy
sir
and
well
could
wish
You
had
not
found
me
here
so
musical
Let
me
excuse
me
and
believe
me
so
My
mirth
it
much
displeasd
but
pleasd
my
woe
Tis
good
though
music
oft
hath
such
a
charm
To
make
bad
good
and
good
provoke
to

I
pray
you
tell
me
hath
anybody
inquird
for
me
here
today
Much
upon

have
I
promisd
here
to
meet
You

not
been
inquird
after
I
have
sat
here
all
day
Enter
I
do
constantly
believe
you
The

is

even

I
shall
crave
your

May

for
some

to
yourself
I
am

Very
well
met
and
well

What
is
the
news
from
this
good
deputy
He
hath
a
garden
circummurd
with
brick
Whose
western
side
is
with
a
vineyard
backd
And
to
that
vineyard
is
a
planched
gate
That
makes
his
opening
with
this
bigger
key
This
other
doth
command
a
little
door
Which
from
the
vineyard
to
the
garden
leads
There
have
I
made
my
promise
Upon
the
heavy
middle
of
the
night
To
call
upon
him
But
shall
you
on
your
knowledge
find
this
way
I
have
taen
a
due
and
wary
note
upont
With
whispering
and
most
guilty
diligence
In
action
all
of
precept
he
did
show
me
The
way
twice
oer
Are
there
no
other
tokens
Between
you
greed
concerning
her
observance
No
none
but
only
a
repair
i
th
dark
And
that
I
have
possessd
him
my
most
stay
Can
be
but
brief
for
I
have
made
him
know
I
have
a
servant
comes
with
me
along
That
stays
upon
me
whose
persuasion
is
I
come
about
my
brother
Tis
well
borne
up
I
have
not
yet
made
known
to
Mariana
word
of
this
What
ho
within
come
forth
Reenter
I
pray
you
be
acquainted
with
this
maid
She
comes
to
do
you
good
I
do
desire
the
like
Do
you
persuade
yourself
that
I
respect
you
Good
friar
I
know
you
do
and
have
found
it
Take
then
this
your
companion
by
the
hand
Who
hath
a
story
ready
for
your
ear
I
shall
attend
your
leisure
but
make
haste
The
vaporous
night
approaches
Willt
please
you
walk
aside
place
and
greatness
Millions
of
false
eyes
Are
stuck
upon
thee
Volumes
of
report
Run
with
these
false
and
most
contrarious
quest
Upon
thy
doings
Thousand
escapes
of
wit
Make
thee
the
father
of
their
idle
dream
And
rack
thee
in
their
fancies
Reenter
and
Welcome
how
agreed
Shell
take
the
enterprise
upon
her
father
If
you
advise
it
It
is
not
my
consent
But
my
entreaty
too
Little
have
you
to
say
When
you
depart
from
him
but
soft
and
low
Remember
now
my
brother
Fear
me
not
Nor
gentle
daughter
fear
you
not
at
all
He
is
your
husband
on
a
precontract
To
bring
you
thus
together
tis
no
sin
Sith
that
the
justice
of
your
title
to
him
Doth
flourish
the
deceit

Were
damnable
Here

morning
of
a
cruel
fever
One
Ragozine
a
most
notorious
pirate
man
of
Claudios
years
his
beard
and
head
Just
of
his
colour
What
if
we
do
omit
This
reprobate
till
he
were
well
inclind
And
satisfy
the
deputy
with
the
visage
Of
Ragozine
more
like
to
Claudio
tis
an
accident
that
heaven
provides
Dispatch

the
hour
draws
on
Prefixd
by
Angelo
See

And

This

But
Barnardine
must
die
this
afternoon
And
how
shall
we
continue
Claudio
To
save
me
from
the
danger
that
might
come
If

known
alive
Let

be
done
Put

The

If

her
brothers

But
I
will
keep
her
ignorant
of
her

To
make
her
heavenly
comforts
of
despair
When
it
is
least
expected
Enter
Ho

your
leave
Good
morning
to
you
fair
and
gracious
daughter
The
better
given

by
so
holy
a
man
Hath

the
deputy
sent
my
brothers

He
hath
releasd
him
Isabel
from
the
world
His

to
Angelo
Nay

not

It
is
no
other
Show
your
wisdom
daughter
in
your
close
patience
I
will
to
him
and

out
his
eyes
You

sight
Unhappy

Injurious

Most
damned

This

jot
Forbear
it

Mark

By

syllable
a
faithful
verity
The
Duke

One
of
our

confessor
Gives

this
instance
Already

Notice
to
Escalus
and
Angelo
Who

the
gates
There

give
up
their

If

your
wisdom
In

good
path

And

wretch
Grace

vow
And

this
letter
Command
these
fretting
waters

course
Whos

Good

Friar
wheres
the
Provost
Not
within
sir
pretty
Isabella
I
am
pale
at
mine
heart
to
see
thine
eyes
so
red
Thou
must
be
patient
I
am
fain
to
dine
and
sup
with
water
and
bran
I
dare
not
for
my
head
fill
my
belly
one
fruitful
meal
would
set
me
tot
But
they
say
the
Duke
will
be
here
tomorrow
By
my
troth
Isabel
I
lovd
thy
brother
If
the
old
fantastical
Duke
of
dark
corners
had
been
at
home
he
had
lived
Sir
the
Duke
is
marvellous
little
beholding
to
your
reports
but
the
best
is
he
lives
not
in
them
Friar
thou
knowest
not
the
Duke
so
well
as
I
do
hes
a
better
woodman
than
thou
takst
him
for
Well
youll
answer
this
one
day
Fare
ye
well
Nay
tarry
Ill
go
along
with
thee
I
can
tell
thee
pretty
tales
of
the
Duke
You
have
told
me
too
many
of
him
already
sir
if
they
be
true
if
not
true
none
were
enough
I
was
once
before
him
for
getting
a
wench
with
child
Did
you
such
a
thing
Yes
marry
did
I
but
I
was
fain
to
forswear
it
they
would
else
have
married
me
to
the
rotten
medlar
Sir
your
company
is
fairer
than
honest
Rest
you
well
By
my
troth
Ill
go
with
thee
to
the
lanes
end
If
bawdy
talk
offend
you
well
have
very
little
of
it
Nay
friar
I
am
a
kind
of
burr
I
shall
stick
These
letters
at
fit
time
deliver
me
Giving
letters
The
Provost
knows
our
purpose
and
our
plot
The
matter
being
afoot
keep
your
instruction
And
hold
you
ever
to
our
special
drift
Though
sometimes
you
do
blench
from
this
to
that
As
cause
doth
minister
Go
call
at
Flavius
house
And
tell
him
where
I
stay
give
the
like
notice
To
Valentinus
Rowland
and
to
Crassus
And
bid
them
bring
the
trumpets
to
the
gate
But
send
me
Flavius
first
It
shall
be
speeded
well
Enter
I
thank
thee
Varrius
thou
hast
made
good
haste
Come
we
will
walk
Theres
other
of
our
friends
Will
greet
us
here
anon
My
gentle
Varrius
I
I
Venice
street
Enter
and
In
sooth
I
know
not
why
I
am
so
sad
It
wearies
me
you
say
it
wearies
you
But
how
I
caught
it
found
it
or
came
by
it
What
stuff
tis
made
of
whereof
it
is
born
I
am
to
learn
And
such
a
wantwit
sadness
makes
of
me
That
I
have
much
ado
to
know
myself
Your
mind
is
tossing
on
the
ocean
There
where
your
argosies
with
portly
sail
Like
signiors
and
rich
burghers
on
the
flood
Or
as
it
were
the
pageants
of
the
sea
Do
overpeer
the
petty
traffickers
That
curtsy
to
them
do
them
reverence
As
they
fly
by
them
with
their
woven
wings
Believe
me
sir
had
I
such
venture
forth
The
better
part
of
my
affections
would
Be
with
my
hopes
abroad
I
should
be
still
Plucking
the
grass
to
know
where
sits
the
wind
Peering
in
maps
for
ports
and
piers
and
roads
And
every
object
that
might
make
me
fear
Misfortune
to
my
ventures
out
of
doubt
Would
make
me
sad
My
wind
cooling
my
broth
Would
blow
me
to
an
ague
when
I
thought
What
harm
a
wind
too
great
might
do
at
sea
I
should
not
see
the
sandy
hourglass
run
But
I
should
think
of
shallows
and
of
flats
And
see
my
wealthy
Andrew
dockd
in
sand
Vailing
her
high
top
lower
than
her
ribs
To
kiss
her
burial
Should
I
go
to
church
And
see
the
holy
edifice
of
stone
And
not
bethink
me
straight
of
dangerous
rocks
Which
touching
but
my
gentle
vessels
side
Would
scatter
all
her
spices
on
the
stream
Enrobe
the
roaring
waters
with
my
silks
And
in
a
word
but
even
now
worth
this
And
now
worth
nothing
Shall
I
have
the
thought
To
think
on
this
and
shall
I
lack
the
thought
That
such
a
thing
bechancd
would
make
me
sad
But
tell
not
me
I
know
Antonio
Is
sad
to
think
upon
his
merchandise
Believe
me
no
I
thank
my
fortune
for
it
My
ventures
are
not
in
one
bottom
trusted
Nor
to
one
place
nor
is
my
whole
estate
Upon
the
fortune
of
this
present
year
Therefore
my
merchandise
makes
me
not
sad
Why
then
you
are
in
love
Fie
fie
Not
in
love
neither
Then
let
us
say
you
are
sad
Because
you
are
not
merry
and
twere
as
easy
For
you
to
laugh
and
leap
and
say
you
are
merry
Because
you
are
not
sad
Now
by
twoheaded
Janus
Nature
hath
framd
strange
fellows
in
her
time
Some
that
will
evermore
peep
through
their
eyes
And
laugh
like
parrots
at
a
bagpiper
And
other
of
such
vinegar
aspect
That
theyll
not
show
their
teeth
in
way
of
smile
Though
Nestor
swear
the
jest
be
laughable
Enter
and
Here
comes
Bassanio
your
most
noble
kinsman
Gratiano
and
Lorenzo
Fare
ye
well
We
leave
you
now
with
better
company
I
would
have
stayd
till
I
had
made
you
merry
If
worthier
friends
had
not
prevented
me
Your
worth
is
very
dear
in
my
regard
I
take
it
your
own
business
calls
on
you
And
you
embrace
th
occasion
to
depart
Good
morrow
my
good
lords
Good
signiors
both
when
shall
we
laugh
Say
when
You
grow
exceeding
strange
must
it
be
so
Well
make
our
leisures
to
attend
on
yours
My
Lord
Bassanio
since
you
have
found
Antonio
We
two
will
leave
you
but
at
dinnertime
I
pray
you
have
in
mind
where
we
must
meet
I
will
not
fail
you
You
look
not
well
Signior
Antonio
You
have
too
much
respect
upon
the
world
They
lose
it
that
do
buy
it
with
much
care
Believe
me
you
are
marvellously
changd
I
hold
the
world
but
as
the
world
Gratiano
stage
where
every
man
must
play
a
part
And
mine
a
sad
one
Let
me
play
the
fool
With
mirth
and
laughter
let
old
wrinkles
come
And
let
my
liver
rather
heat
with
wine
Than
my
heart
cool
with
mortifying
groans
Why
should
a
man
whose
blood
is
warm
within
Sit
like
his
grandsire
cut
in
alabaster
Sleep
when
he
wakes
and
creep
into
the
jaundice
By
being
peevish
I
tell
thee
what
Antonio
I
love
thee
and
tis
my
love
that
speaks
There
are
a
sort
of
men
whose
visages
Do
cream
and
mantle
like
a
standing
pond
And
do
a
wilful
stillness
entertain
With
purpose
to
be
dressd
in
an
opinion
Of
wisdom
gravity
profound
conceit
As
who
should
say
I
am
Sir
Oracle
And
when
I
ope
my
lips
let
no
dog
bark
my
Antonio
I
do
know
of
these
That
therefore
only
are
reputed
wise
For
saying
nothing
when
I
am
very
sure
If
they
should
speak
would
almost
damn
those
ears
Which
hearing
them
would
call
their
brothers
fools
Ill
tell
thee
more
of
this
another
time
But
fish
not
with
this
melancholy
bait
For
this
fool
gudgeon
this
opinion
Come
good
Lorenzo
Fare
ye
well
awhile
Ill
end
my
exhortation
after
dinner
Well
we
will
leave
you
then
till
dinnertime
I
must
be
one
of
these
same
dumb
wise
men
For
Gratiano
never
lets
me
speak
Well
keep
me
company
but
two
years
moe
Thou
shalt
not
know
the
sound
of
thine
own
tongue
Fare
you
well
Ill
grow
a
talker
for
this
gear
Thanks
i
faith
for
silence
is
only
commendable
In
a
neats
tongue
dried
and
a
maid
not
vendible
Is
that
anything
now
Gratiano
speaks
an
infinite
deal
of
nothing
more
than
any
man
in
all
Venice
His
reasons
are
as
two
grains
of
wheat
hid
in
two
bushels
of
chaff
you
shall
seek
all
day
ere
you
find
them
and
when
you
have
them
they
are
not
worth
the
search
Well
tell
me
now
what
lady
is
the
same
To
whom
you
swore
a
secret
pilgrimage
That
you
today
promisd
to
tell
me
of
Tis
not
unknown
to
you
Antonio
How
much
I
have
disabled
mine
estate
By
something
showing
a
more
swelling
port
Than
my
faint
means
would
grant
continuance
Nor
do
I
now
make
moan
to
be
abridgd
From
such
a
noble
rate
but
my
chief
care
Is
to
come
fairly
off
from
the
great
debts
Wherein
my
time
something
too
prodigal
Hath
left
me
gagd
To
you
Antonio
I
owe
the
most
in
money
and
in
love
And
from
your
love
I
have
a
warranty
To
unburden
all
my
plots
and
purposes
How
to
get
clear
of
all
the
debts
I
owe
I
pray
you
good
Bassanio
let
me
know
it
And
if
it
stand
as
you
yourself
still
do
Within
the
eye
of
honour
be
assurd
My
purse
my
person
my
extremest
means
Lie
all
unlockd
to
your
occasions
In
my
schooldays
when
I
had
lost
one
shaft
I
shot
his
fellow
of
the
selfsame
flight
The
selfsame
way
with
more
advised
watch
To
find
the
other
forth
and
by
adventuring
both
I
oft
found
both
I
urge
this
childhood
proof
Because
what
follows
is
pure
innocence
I
owe
you
much
and
like
a
wilful
youth
That
which
I
owe
is
lost
but
if
you
please
To
shoot
another
arrow
that
self
way
Which
you
did
shoot
the
first
I
do
not
doubt
As
I
will
watch
the
aim
or
to
find
both
Or
bring
your
latter
hazard
back
again
And
thankfully
rest
debtor
for
the
first
You
know
me
well
and
herein
spend
but
time
To
wind
about
my
love
with
circumstance
And
out
of
doubt
you
do
me
now
more
wrong
In
making
question
of
my
uttermost
Than
if
you
had
made
waste
of
all
I
have
Then
do
but
say
to
me
what
I
should
do
That
in
your
knowledge
may
by
me
be
done
And
I
am
prest
unto
it
therefore
speak
In
Belmont
is
a
lady
richly
left
And
she
is
fair
and
fairer
than
that
word
Of
wondrous
virtues
Sometimes
from
her
eyes
I
did
receive
fair
speechless
messages
Her
name
is
Portia
nothing
undervalud
To
Catos
daughter
Brutus
Portia
Nor
is
the
wide
world
ignorant
of
her
worth
For
the
four
winds
blow
in
from
every
coast
Renowned
suitors
and
her
sunny
locks
Hang
on
her
temples
like
a
golden
fleece
Which
makes
her
seat
of
Belmont
Colchos
strond
And
many
Jasons
come
in
quest
of
her
my
Antonio
had
I
but
the
means
To
hold
a
rival
place
with
one
of
them
I
have
a
mind
presages
me
such
thrift
That
I
should
questionless
be
fortunate
Thou
knowst
that
all
my
fortunes
are
at
sea
Neither
have
I
money
nor
commodity
To
raise
a
present
sum
therefore
go
forth
Try
what
my
credit
can
in
Venice
do
That
shall
be
rackd
even
to
the
uttermost
To
furnish
thee
to
Belmont
to
fair
Portia
Go
presently
inquire
and
so
will
I
Where
money
is
and
I
no
question
make
To
have
it
of
my
trust
or
for
my
sake
Three
thousand
ducats
well
Ay
sir
for
three
months
For
three
months
well
For
the
which
as
I
told
you
Antonio
shall
be
bound
Antonio
shall
become
bound
well
May
you
stead
me
Will
you
pleasure
me
Shall
I
know
your
answer
Three
thousand
ducats
for
three
months
and
Antonio
bound
Your
answer
to
that
Antonio
is
a
good
man
Have
you
heard
any
imputation
to
the
contrary
Ho
no
no
no
no
my
meaning
in
saying
he
is
a
good
man
is
to
have
you
understand
me
that
he
is
sufficient
yet
his
means
are
in
supposition
he
hath
an
argosy
bound
to
Tripolis
another
to
the
Indies
I
understand
moreover
upon
the
Rialto
he
hath
a
third
at
Mexico
a
fourth
for
England
and
other
ventures
he
hath
squandred
abroad
But
ships
are
but
boards
sailors
but
men
there
be
landrats
and
waterrats
waterthieves
and
landthieves
I
mean
pirates
and
then
there
is
the
peril
of
waters
winds
and
rocks
The
man
is
notwithstanding
sufficient
Three
thousand
ducats
I
think
I
may
take
his
bond
Be
assurd
you
may
I
will
be
assurd
I
may
and
that
I
may
be
assured
I
will
bethink
me
May
I
speak
with
Antonio
If
it
please
you
to
dine
with
us
Yes
to
smell
pork
to
eat
of
the
habitation
which
your
prophet
the
Nazarite
conjured
the
devil
into
I
will
buy
with
you
sell
with
you
talk
with
you
walk
with
you
and
so
following
but
I
will
not
eat
with
you
drink
with
you
nor
pray
with
you
What
news
on
the
Rialto
Who
is
he
comes
here
Enter
This
is
Signior
Antonio
Aside
How
like
a
fawning
publican
he
looks
I
hate
him
for
he
is
a
Christian
But
more
for
that
in
low
simplicity
He
lends
out
money
gratis
and
brings
down
The
rate
of
usance
here
with
us
in
Venice
If
I
can
catch
him
once
upon
the
hip
I
will
feed
fat
the
ancient
grudge
I
bear
him
He
hates
our
sacred
nation
and
he
rails
Even
there
where
merchants
most
do
congregate
On
me
my
bargains
and
my
wellwon
thrift
Which
he
calls
interest
Cursed
be
my
tribe
If
I
forgive
him
Shylock
do
you
hear
I
am
debating
of
my
present
store
And
by
the
near
guess
of
my
memory
I
cannot
instantly
raise
up
the
gross
Of
full
three
thousand
ducats
What
of
that
Tubal
a
wealthy
Hebrew
of
my
tribe
Will
furnish
me
But
soft
how
many
months
Do
you
desire
To
Rest
you
fair
good
signior
Your
worship
was
the
last
man
in
our
mouths
Shylock
albeit
I
neither
lend
nor
borrow
By
taking
nor
by
giving
of
excess
Yet
to
supply
the
ripe
wants
of
my
friend
Ill
break
a
custom
To
Is
he
yet
possessd
How
much
ye
would
Ay
ay
three
thousand
ducats
And
for
three
months
I
had
forgot
three
months
you
told
me
so
Well
then
your
bond
and
let
me
see
but
hear
you
Methoughts
you
said
you
neither
lend
nor
borrow
Upon
advantage
I
do
never
use
it
When
Jacob
grazd
his
uncle
Labans
sheep
This
Jacob
from
our
holy
Abram
was
As
his
wise
mother
wrought
in
his
behalf
The
third
possessor
ay
he
was
the
third
And
what
of
him
Did
he
take
interest
No
not
take
interest
not
as
you
would
say
Directly
intrest
mark
what
Jacob
did
When
Laban
and
himself
were
compromisd
That
all
the
eanlings
which
were
streakd
and
pied
Should
fall
as
Jacobs
hire
the
ewes
being
rank
In
end
of
autumn
turned
to
the
rams
And
when
the
work
of
generation
was
Between
these
woolly
breeders
in
the
act
The
skilful
shepherd
pilld
me
certain
wands
And
in
the
doing
of
the
deed
of
kind
He
stuck
them
up
before
the
fulsome
ewes
Who
then
conceiving
did
in
eaning
time
Fall
particolourd
lambs
and
those
were
Jacobs
This
was
a
way
to
thrive
and
he
was
blest
And
thrift
is
blessing
if
men
steal
it
not
This
was
a
venture
sir
that
Jacob
servd
for
thing
not
in
his
power
to
bring
to
pass
But
swayd
and
fashiond
by
the
hand
of
heaven
Was
this
inserted
to
make
interest
good
Or
is
your
gold
and
silver
ewes
and
rams
I
cannot
tell
I
make
it
breed
as
fast
But
note
me
signior
Aside
Mark
you
this
Bassanio
The
devil
can
cite
Scripture
for
his
purpose
An
evil
soul
producing
holy
witness
Is
like
a
villain
with
a
smiling
cheek
goodly
apple
rotten
at
the
heart
what
a
goodly
outside
falsehood
hath
Three
thousand
ducats
tis
a
good
round
sum
Three
months
from
twelve
then
let
me
see
the
rate
Well
Shylock
shall
we
be
beholding
to
you
Signior
Antonio
many
a
time
and
oft
In
the
Rialto
you
have
rated
me
About
my
moneys
and
my
usances
Still
have
I
borne
it
with
a
patient
shrug
For
suffrance
is
the
badge
of
all
our
tribe
You
call
me
misbeliever
cutthroat
dog
And
spit
upon
my
Jewish
gaberdine
And
all
for
use
of
that
which
is
mine
own
Well
then
it
now
appears
you
need
my
help
Go
to
then
you
come
to
me
and
you
say
Shylock
we
would
have
moneys
You
say
so
You
that
did
void
your
rheum
upon
my
beard
And
foot
me
as
you
spurn
a
stranger
cur
Over
your
threshold
moneys
is
your
suit
What
should
I
say
to
you
Should
I
not
say
Hath
a
dog
money
Is
it
possible
cur
can
lend
three
thousand
ducats
Or
Shall
I
bend
low
and
in
a
bondmans
key
With
bated
breath
and
whispring
humbleness
Say
this
Fair
sir
you
spit
on
me
on
Wednesday
last
You
spurnd
me
such
a
day
another
time
You
calld
me
dog
and
for
these
courtesies
Ill
lend
you
thus
much
moneys
I
am
as
like
to
call
thee
so
again
To
spit
on
thee
again
to
spurn
thee
too
If
thou
wilt
lend
this
money
lend
it
not
As
to
thy
friends
for
when
did
friendship
take
breed
for
barren
metal
of
his
friend
But
lend
it
rather
to
thine
enemy
Who
if
he
break
thou
mayst
with
better
face
Exact
the
penalty
Why
look
you
how
you
storm
I
would
be
friends
with
you
and
have
your
love
Forget
the
shames
that
you
have
staind
me
with
Supply
your
present
wants
and
take
no
doit
Of
usance
for
my
moneys
and
youll
not

This

This
were
kindness
This
kindness
will
I
show
Go

a
merry
sport
If

day
In

a
place

or

Expressd

Content

faith
Ill

bond
And

much
kindness
in

You

such
a
bond
for
me
Ill
rather
dwell
in
my
necessity
Why
fear
not
man
I
will
not
forfeit
it
Within
these
two
months
thats
a
month
before
This
bond
expires
I
do
expect
return
Of
thrice
three
times
the
value
of
this
bond
father
Abram
what
these
Christians
are
Whose
own
hard
dealings
teaches
them

The
thoughts
of
others
Pray

tell
me
this
If

day

By
the
exaction
of

of
mans
flesh
taken
from
a
man
Is
not
so
estimable
profitable

As
flesh
of
muttons
beefs
or
goats
I
say
To
buy
his
favour
I
extend
this
friendship
If
he
will
take
it
so
if
not
adieu
And
for
my
love
I

Then

And

Of

Come

Flourish
of

Enter

a
tawny
Moor
all

white
and

or
four
accordingly
with
and

Morocco
Mislike
me
not
for
my
complexion
The
shadowed
livery
of
the
burnishd
sun
To
whom
I
am
a
neighbour
and
near
bred
Bring
me
the
fairest
creature
northward
born
Where
Phoebus
fire
scarce
thaws
the
icicles
And
let
us
make
incision
for
your
love
To
prove
whose
blood
is
reddest
his
or
mine
I
tell
thee
lady
this
aspect
of
mine
Hath
feard
the
valiant
by
my
love
I
swear
The
bestregarded
virgins
of
our
clime
Have
lovd
it
too
I
would
not
change
this
hue
Except
to
steal
your
thoughts
my
gentle
queen
In
terms
of
choice
I
am
not
solely
led
By
nice
direction
of
a
maidens
eyes
Besides
the
lottry
of
my
destiny
Bars
me
the
right
of
voluntary
choosing
But
if
my
father
had
not
scanted
me
And
hedgd
me
by
his
wit
to
yield
myself
His
wife
who
wins
me
by
that
means
I
told
you
Yourself
renowned
Prince
then
stood
as
fair
As
any
comer
I
have
lookd
on
yet
For
my
affection
Even
for
that
I
thank
you
Therefore
I
pray
you
lead
me
to
the
caskets
To
try
my
fortune
By
this
scimitar
That
slew
the
Sophy
and
a
Persian
prince
That
won
three
fields
of
Sultan
Solyman
I
would
oerstare
the
sternest
eyes
that
look
Outbrave
the
heart
most
daring
on
the
earth
Pluck
the
young
sucking
cubs
from
the
shebear
Yea
mock
the
lion
when
a
roars
for
prey
To
win
thee
lady
But
alas
the
while
If
Hercules
and
Lichas
play
at
dice
Which
is
the
better
man
the
greater
throw
May
turn
by
fortune
from
the
weaker
band
So
is
Alcides
beaten
by
his
page
And
so
may
I
blind
Fortune
leading
me
Miss
that
which
one
unworthier
may
attain
And
die
with
grieving
You
must
take
your
chance
And
either
not
attempt
to
choose
at
all
Or
swear
before
you
choose
if
you
choose
wrong
Never
to
speak
to

In
way
of
marriage
therefore
be
advisd
Nor
will
not
come
bring
me
unto
my
chance
First
forward
to
the
temple
After
dinner
Your
hazard
shall
be
made
Good
fortune
then
To
make
me
blest
or
cursedst
among
men
Cornets
and
exeunt
I
am
sorry
thou
wilt
leave
my
father
so
Our
house
is
hell
and
thou
a
merry
devil
Didst
rob
it
of
some
taste
of
tediousness
But
fare
thee
well
there
is
a
ducat
for
thee
And
Launcelot
soon
at
supper
shalt
thou
see
Lorenzo
who
is
thy
new
masters
guest
Give
him
this
letter
do
it
secretly
And
so
farewell
I
would
not
have
my
father
See
me
in
talk
with
thee
Adieu
tears
exhibit
my
tongue
Most
beautiful
pagan
most
sweet
Jew
If
a
Christian
do
not
play
the
knave
and
get
thee
I
am
much
deceived
But
adieu
these
foolish
drops
do
something
drown
my
manly
spirit
adieu
Farewell
good
Launcelot
Alack
what
heinous
sin
is
it
in
me
To
be
ashamd
to
be
my
fathers
child
But
though
I
am
a
daughter
to
his
blood
I
am
not
to
his
manners
Lorenzo
If
thou
keep
promise
I
shall
end
this
strife
Become
a
Christian
and
thy
loving
wife
Well
thou
shalt
see
thy
eyes
shall
be
thy
judge
The
difference
of
old
Shylock
and
Bassanio
What
Jessica
Thou
shalt
not
gormandize
As
thou
hast
done
with
me
What
Jessica
And
sleep
and
snore
and
rend
apparel
out
Why
Jessica
I
say
Why
Jessica
Who
bids
thee
call
I
do
not
bid
thee
call
Your
worship
was
wont
to
tell
me
I
could
do
nothing
without
bidding
Enter
Call
you
What
is
your
will
I
am
bid
forth
to
supper
Jessica
There
are
my
keys
But
wherefore
should
I
go
I
am
not
bid
for
love
they
flatter
me
But
yet
Ill
go
in
hate
to
feed
upon
The
prodigal
Christian
Jessica
my
girl
Look
to
my
house
I
am
right
loath
to
go
There
is
some
ill
abrewing
towards
my
rest
For
I
did
dream
of
moneybags
tonight
I
beseech
you
sir
go
my
young
master
doth
expect
your
reproach
So
do
I
his
And
they
have
conspired
together
I
will
not
say
you
shall
see
a
masque
but
if
you
do
then
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
my
nose
fell
ableeding
on
Black
Monday
last
at
six
oclock
i
th
morning
falling
out
that
year
on
Ash
Wednesday
was
four
year
in
th
afternoon
What
are
there
masques
Hear
you
me
Jessica
Lock
up
my
doors
and
when
you
hear
the
drum
And
the
vile
squealing
of
the
wryneckd
fife
Clamber
not
you
up
to
the
casements
then
Nor
thrust
your
head
into
the
public
street
To
gaze
on
Christian
fools
with
varnishd
faces
But
stop
my
houses
ears
I
mean
my
casements
Let
not
the
sound
of
shallow
foppry
enter
My
sober
house
By
Jacobs
staff
I
swear
I
have
no
mind
of
feasting
forth
tonight
But
I
will
go
Go
you
before
me
sirrah
Say
I
will
come
I
will
go
before
sir
Mistress
look
out
at
window
for
all
this
There
will
come
a
Christian
by
Will
be
worth
a
Jewess
eye
What
says
that
fool
of
Hagars
offspring
ha
His
words
were
Farewell
mistress
nothing
else
The
patch
is
kind
enough
but
a
huge
feeder
Snailslow
in
profit
and
he
sleeps
by
day
More
than
the
wildcat
drones
hive
not
with
me
Therefore
I
part
with
him
and
part
with
him
To
one
that
I
would
have
him
help
to
waste
His
borrowed
purse
Well
Jessica
go
in
Perhaps
I
will
return
immediately
Do
as
I
bid
you
shut
doors
after
you
Fast
bind
fast
find
proverb
never
stale
in
thrifty
mind
Farewell
and
if
my
fortune
be
not
crost
I
have
a
father
you
a
daughter
lost
Go
draw
aside
the
curtains
and
discover
The
several
caskets
to
this
noble
Prince
Now
make
your
choice
The
first
of
gold
who
this
inscription
bears
Who
chooseth
me
shall
gain
what
many
men
desire
The
second
silver
which
this
promise
carries
Who
chooseth
me
shall
get
as
much
as
he
deserves
This
third
dull
lead
with
warning
all
as
blunt
Who
chooseth
me
must
give
and
hazard
all
he
hath
How
shall
I
know
if
I
do
choose
the
right
The
one
of
them
contains
my
picture
Prince
If
you
choose
that
then
I
am
yours
withal
Some
god
direct
my
judgment
Let
me
see
I
will
survey
th
inscriptions
back
again
What
says
this
leaden
casket
Who
chooseth
me
must
give
and
hazard
all
he
hath
Must
give
for
what
For
lead
Hazard
for
lead
This
casket
threatens
men
that
hazard
all
Do
it
in
hope
of
fair
advantages
golden
mind
stoops
not
to
shows
of
dross
Ill
then
nor
give
nor
hazard
aught
for
lead
What
says
the
silver
with
her
virgin
hue
Who
chooseth
me
shall
get
as
much
as
he
deserves
As
much
as
he
deserves
Pause
there
Morocco
And
weigh
thy
value
with
an
even
hand
If
thou
beest
rated
by
thy
estimation
Thou
dost
deserve
enough
and
yet
enough
May
not
extend
so
far
as
to
the
lady
And
yet
to
be
afeard
of
my
deserving
Were
but
a
weak
disabling
of
myself
As
much
as
I
deserve
Why
thats
the
lady
I
do
in
birth
deserve
her
and
in
fortunes
In
graces
and
in
qualities
of
breeding
But
more
than
these
in
love
I
do
deserve
What
if
I
strayd
no
farther
but
chose
here
Lets
see
once
more
this
saying
gravd
in
gold
Who
chooseth
me
shall
gain
what
many
men
desire
Why
thats
the
lady
All
the
world
desires
her
From
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
they
come
To
kiss
this
shrine
this
mortalbreathing
saint
The
Hyrcanian
deserts
and
the
vasty
wilds
Of
wide
Arabia
are
as
throughfares
now
For
princes
to
come
view
fair
Portia
The
watery
kingdom
whose
ambitious
head
Spits
in
the
face
of
heaven
is
no
bar
To
stop
the
foreign
spirits
but
they
come
As
oer
a
brook
to
see
fair
Portia
One
of
these
three
contains
her
heavenly
picture
Ist
like
that
lead
contains
her
Twere
damnation
To
think
so
base
a
thought
it
were
too
gross
To
rib
her
cerecloth
in
the
obscure
grave
Or
shall
I
think
in
silver
shes
immurd
Being
ten
times
undervalued
to
tried
gold
sinful
thought
Never
so
rich
a
gem
Was
set
in
worse
than
gold
They
have
in
England
coin
that
bears
the
figure
of
an
angel
Stampd
in
gold
but
thats
insculpd
upon
But
here
an
angel
in
a
golden
bed
Lies
all
within
Deliver
me
the
key
Here
do
I
choose
and
thrive
I
as
I
may
There
take
it
Prince
and
if
my
form
lie
there
Then
I
am
yours
He
opens
the
golden
casket
hell
what
have
we
here
carrion
Death
within
whose
empty
eye
There
is
a
written
scroll
Ill
read
the
writing
All
that
glisters
is
not
gold
Often
have
you
heard
that
told
Many
a
man
his
life
hath
sold
But
my
outside
to
behold
Gilded
tombs
do
worms
infold
Had
you
been
as
wise
as
bold
Young
in
limbs
in
judgment
old
Your
answer
had
not
been
inscrolld
Fare
you
well
your
suit
is
cold
Cold
indeed
and
labour
lost
Then
farewell
heat
and
welcome
frost
Portia
adieu
I
have
too
grievd
a
heart
To
take
a
tedious
leave
thus
losers
part
gentle
riddance
Draw
the
curtains
go
Let
all
of
his
complexion
choose
me
so
Quick
quick
I
pray
thee
draw
the
curtain
straight
The
Prince
of
Arragon
hath
taen
his
oath
And
comes
to
his
election
presently
Flourish
of
cornets
Enter
the
and
their
trains
Behold
there
stand
the
caskets
noble
Prince
If
you
choose
that
wherein
I
am
containd
Straight
shall
our
nuptial
rites
be
solemnizd
But
if
you
fail
without
more
speech
my
lord
You
must
be
gone
from
hence
immediately
I
am
enjoind
by
oath
to
observe
three
things
First
never
to
unfold
to
any
one
Which
casket
twas
I
chose
next
if
I
fail
Of
the
right
casket
never
in
my
life
To
woo
a
maid
in
way
of
marriage
Lastly
If
I
do
fail
in
fortune
of
my
choice
Immediately
to
leave
you
and
be
gone
To
these
injunctions
every
one
doth
swear
That
comes
to
hazard
for
my
worthless
self
And
so
have
I
addressd
me
Fortune
now
To
my
hearts
hope
Gold
silver
and
base
lead
Who
chooseth
me
must
give
and
hazard
all
he
hath
You
shall
look
fairer
ere
I
give
or
hazard
What
says
the
golden
chest
Ha
let
me
see
Who
chooseth
me
shall
gain
what
many
men
desire
What
many
men
desire
that
many
may
be
meant
By
the
fool
multitude
that
choose
by
show
Not
learning
more
than
the
fond
eye
doth
teach
Which
pries
not
to
th
interior
but
like
the
martlet
Builds
in
the
weather
on
the
outward
wall
Even
in
the
force
and
road
of
casualty
I
will
not
choose
what
many
men
desire
Because
I
will
not
jump
with
common
spirits
And
rank
me
with
the
barbarous
multitudes
Why
then
to
thee
thou
silver
treasurehouse
Tell
me
once
more
what
title
thou
dost
bear
Who
chooseth
me
shall
get
as
much
as
he
deserves
And
well
said
too
for
who
shall
go
about
To
cozen
fortune
and
be
honourable
Without
the
stamp
of
merit
Let
none
presume
To
wear
an
undeserved
dignity
that
estates
degrees
and
offices
Were
not
derivd
corruptly
and
that
clear
honour
Were
purchasd
by
the
merit
of
the
wearer
How
many
then
should
cover
that
stand
bare
How
many
be
commanded
that
command
How
much
low
peasantry
would
then
be
gleaned
From
the
true
seed
of
honour
and
how
much
honour
Pickd
from
the
chaff
and
ruin
of
the
times
To
be
new
varnishd
Well
but
to
my
choice
Who
chooseth
me
shall
get
as
much
as
he
deserves
I
will
assume
desert
Give
me
a
key
for
this
And
instantly
unlock
my
fortunes
here
He
opens
the
silver
casket
Aside
Too
long
a
pause
for
that
which
you
find
there
Whats
here
The
portrait
of
a
blinking
idiot
Presenting
me
a
schedule
I
will
read
it
How
much
unlike
art
thou
to
Portia
How
much
unlike
my
hopes
and
my
deservings
Who
chooseth
me
shall
have
as
much
as
he
deserves
Did
I
deserve
no
more
than
a
fools
head
Is
that
my
prize
Are
my
deserts
no
better
To
offend
and
judge
are
distinct
offices
And
of
opposed
natures
What
is
here
Reads
The
fire
seven
times
tried
this
Seven
times
tried
that
judgment
is
That
did
never
choose
amiss
Some
there
be
that
shadows
kiss
Such
have
but
a
shadows
bliss
There
be
fools
alive
iwis
Silverd
oer
and
so
was
this
Take
what
wife
you
will
to
bed
I
will
ever
be
your
head
So
be
gone
you
are
sped
Still
more
fool
I
shall
appear
By
the
time
I
linger
here
With
one
fools
head
I
came
to
woo
But
I
go
away
with
two
Sweet
adieu
Ill
keep
my
oath
Patiently
to
bear
my
wroth
Thus
hath
the
candle
singd
the
moth
these
deliberate
fools
When
they
do
choose
They
have
the
wisdom
by
their
wit
to
lose
The
ancient
saying
is
no
heresy
Hanging
and
wiving
goes
by
destiny
Come
draw
the
curtain
Nerissa
Enter
a
Where
is
my
lady
Here
what
would
my
lord
Madam
there
is
alighted
at
your
gate
young
Venetian
one
that
comes
before
To
signify
th
approaching
of
his
lord
From
whom
he
bringeth
sensible
regreets
To
wit
besides
commends
and
courteous
breath
Gifts
of
rich
value
Yet
I
have
not
seen
So
likely
an
ambassador
of
love
day
in
April
never
came
so
sweet
To
show
how
costly
summer
was
at
hand
As
this
forespurrer
comes
before
his
lord
No
more
I
pray
thee
I
am
half
afeard
Thou
wilt
say
anon
he
is
some
kin
to
thee
Thou
spendst
such
highday
wit
in
praising
him
Come
come
Nerissa
for
I
long
to
see
Quick
Cupids
post
that
comes
so
mannerly
Bassanio
Lord
Love
if
thy
will
it
be
I
Venice
street
Enter
and
Now
what
news
on
the
Rialto
Why
yet
it
lives
there
uncheckd
that
Antonio
hath
a
ship
of
rich
lading
wreckd
on
the
narrow
seas
the
Goodwins
I
think
they
call
the
place
a
very
dangerous
flat
and
fatal
where
the
carcases
of
many
a
tall
ship
lie
buried
as
they
say
if
my
gossip
Report
be
an
honest
woman
of
her
word
I
would
she
were
as
lying
a
gossip
in
that
as
ever
knappd
ginger
or
made
her
neighbours
believe
she
wept
for
the
death
of
a
third
husband
But
it
is
true
without
any
slips
of
prolixity
or
crossing
the
plain
highway
of
talk
that
the
good
Antonio
the
honest
Antonio
that
I
had
a
title
good
enough
to
keep
his
name
company
Come
the
full
stop
Ha
What
sayest
thou
Why
the
end
is
he
hath
lost
a
ship
I
would
it
might
prove
the
end
of
his
losses
Let
me
say
amen
betimes
lest
the
devil
cross
my
prayer
for
here
he
comes
in
the
likeness
of
a
Jew
Enter
How
now
Shylock
What
news
among
the
merchants
You
knew
none
so
well
none
so
well
as
you
of
my
daughters
flight
Thats
certain
I
for
my
part
knew
the
tailor
that
made
the
wings
she
flew
withal
And
Shylock
for
his
own
part
knew
the
bird
was
flidge
and
then
it
is
the
complexion
of
them
all
to
leave
the
dam
She
is
damnd
for
it
Thats
certain
if
the
devil
may
be
her
judge
My
own
flesh
and
blood
to
rebel
Out
upon
it
old
carrion
Rebels
it
at
these
years
I
say
my
daughter
is
my
flesh
and
my
blood
There
is
more
difference
between
thy
flesh
and
hers
than
between
jet
and
ivory
more
between
your
bloods
than
there
is
between
red
wine
and
Rhenish
But
tell
us
do
you
hear
whether
Antonio
have
had
any
loss
at
sea
or
no
There
I
have
another
bad
match
a
bankrupt
a
prodigal
who
dare
scarce
show
his
head
on
the
Rialto
a
beggar
that
was
usd
to
come
so
smug
upon
the
mart
Let
him
look
to
his
bond
He
was
wont
to
call
me
usurer
let
him
look
to
his
bond
He
was
wont
to
lend
money
for
a
Christian
courtesy
let
him
look
to
his
bond
Why
I
am
sure
if
he
forfeit
thou
wilt
not
take
his
flesh
Whats
that
good
for
To
bait
fish
withal
If
it
will
feed
nothing
else
it
will
feed
my
revenge
He
hath
disgracd
me
and
hindred
me
half
a
million
laughd
at
my
losses
mockd
at
my
gains
scorned
my
nation
thwarted
my
bargains
cooled
my
friends
heated
mine
enemies
And
whats
his
reason
I
am
a
Jew
Hath
not
a
Jew
eyes
Hath
not
a
Jew
hands
organs
dimensions
senses
affections
passions
fed
with
the
same
food
hurt
with
the
same
weapons
subject
to
the
same
diseases
healed
by
the
same
means
warmed
and
cooled
by
the
same
winter
and
summer
as
a
Christian
is
If
you
prick
us
do
we
not
bleed
If
you
tickle
us
do
we
not
laugh
If
you
poison
us
do
we
not
die
And
if
you
wrong
us
shall
we
not
revenge
If
we
are
like
you
in
the
rest
we
will
resemble
you
in
that
If
a
Jew
wrong
a
Christian
what
is
his
humility
Revenge
If
a
Christian
wrong
a
Jew
what
should
his
sufferance
be
by
Christian
example
Why
revenge
The
villainy
you
teach
me
I
will
execute
and
itshall
go
hard
but
I
will
better
the
instruction
Enter
a
from
Gentlemen
my
master
Antonio
is
at
his
house
and
desires
to
speak
with
you
both
We
have
been
up
and
down
to
seek
him
Enter
Here
comes

Why

The

Two

coffin
No

Why

Why

The

much
and
so
much
to
find
the
thief
and
no
satisfaction
no

nor
no
ill
luck

but
what
lights

my
shoulders
no
sighs
but
o
my
breathing
no

but

my
shedding
Yes

of
the
sailors
that

the
wreck
I
thank
thee
good
Tubal
Good
news
good
news
ha
ha
heard
in
Genoa
Your
daughter
spent
in
Genoa
as
I
heard
one
night
fourscore
ducats
Thou
stickst
a
dagger
in
me
I
shall
never
see
my
gold
again
Fourscore
ducats
at
a
sitting
Fourscore
ducats
There
came
divers
of
Antonios
creditors
in
my
company
to
Venice
that
swear
he
cannot
choose
but
break
I
am
very
glad
of
it
Ill
plague
him
Ill
torture
him
I
am
glad
of
it
One
of
them
showed
me
a
ring
that
he
had
of
your
daughter
for
a
monkey
Out
upon
her
Thou
torturest
me
Tubal
It
was
my
turquoise
I
had
it
of
Leah
when
I
was
a
bachelor
I
would
not
have
given
it
for
a
wilderness
of
monkeys
But
Antonio
is
certainly
undone
Nay
thats
true
thats
very
true
Go
Tubal
fee
me
an
officer
bespeak
him
a
fortnight
before
I
will
have
the
heart
of
him
if
he
forfeit
for
were
he
out
of
Venice
I
can
make
what
merchandise
I
will
Go
Tubal
and
meet
me
at
our
synagogue
go
good
Tubal
at
our
synagogue
Tubal
Gaoler
look
to
him
Tell
not
me
of
mercy
This
is
the
fool
that
lent
out
money
gratis
Gaoler
look
to
him
Hear
me
yet
good
Shylock
Ill
have
my
bond
speak
not
against
my
bond
I
have
sworn
an
oath
that
I
will
have
my
bond
Thou
calldst
me
dog
before
thou
hadst
a
cause
But
since
I
am
a
dog
beware
my
fangs
The
Duke
shall
grant
me
justice
I
do
wonder
Thou
naughty
gaoler
that
thou
art
so
fond
To
come
abroad
with
him
at
his
request
I
pray
thee
hear
me
speak
Ill
have
my
bond
I
will
not
hear
thee
speak
Ill
have
my
bond
and
therefore
speak
no
more
Ill
not
be
made
a
soft
and
dulleyd
fool
To
shake
the
head
relent
and
sigh
and
yield
To
Christian
intercessors
Follow
not
Ill
have
no
speaking
I
will
have
my
bond
It
is
the
most
impenetrable
cur
That
ever
kept
with
men
Let
him
alone
Ill
follow
him
no
more
with
bootless
prayers
He
seeks
my
life
his
reason
well
I
know
I
oft
deliverd
from
his
forfeitures
Many
that
have
at
times
made
moan
to
me
Therefore
he
hates
me
I
am
sure
the
Duke
Will
never
grant
this
forfeiture
to
hold
The
Duke
cannot
deny
the
course
of
law
For
the
commodity
that
strangers
have
With
us
in
Venice
if
it
be
denied
Will
much
impeach
the
justice
of
the
state
Since
that
the
trade
and
profit
of
the
city
Consisteth
of
all
nations
Therefore
go
These
griefs
and
losses
have
so
bated
me
That
I
shall
hardly
spare
a
pound
of
flesh
Tomorrow
to
my
bloody
creditor
Well
gaoler
on
pray
God
Bassanio
come
To
see
me
pay
his
debt
and
then
I
care
not
Yes
truly
for
look
you
the
sins
of
the
father
are
to
be
laid
upon
the
children
therefore
I
promise
you
I
fear
you
I
was
always
plain
with
you
and
so
now
I
speak
my
agitation
of
the
matter
therefore
be
o
good
cheer
for
truly
I
think
you
are
damnd
There
is
but
one
hope
in
it
that
can
do
you
any
good
and
that
is
but
a
kind
of
bastard
hope
neither
And
what
hope
is
that
I
pray
thee
Marry
you
may
partly
hope
that
your
father
got
you
not
that
you
are
not
the
Jews
daughter
That
were
a
kind
of
bastard
hope
indeed
so
the
sins
of
my
mother
should
be
visited
upon
me
Truly
then
I
fear
you
are
damnd
both
by
father
and
mother
thus
when
I
shun
Scylla
your
father
I
fall
into
Charybdis
your
mother
well
you
are
gone
both
ways
I
shall
be
savd
by
my
husband
he
hath
made
me
a
Christian
Truly
the
more
to
blame
he
we
were
Christians
enow
before
een
as
many
as
could
well
live
one
by
another
This
making
of
Christians
will
raise
the
price
of
hogs
if
we
grow
all
to
be
porkeaters
we
shall
not
shortly
have
a
rasher
on
the
coals
for
money
Enter
Ill
tell
my
husband
Launcelot
what
you
say
here
he
comes
I
shall
grow
jealous
of
you
shortly
Launcelot
if
you
thus
get
my
wife
into
corners
Nay
you
need
nor
fear
us
Lorenzo
Launcelot
and
I
are
out
he
tells
me
flatly
theres
no
mercy
for
me
in
heaven
because
I
am
a
Jews
daughter
and
he
says
you
are
no
good
member
of
the
commonwealth
for
in
converting
Jews
to
Christians
you
raise
the
price
of
pork
I
shall
answer
that
better
to
the
commonwealth
than
you
can
the
getting
up
of
the
negros
belly
the
Moor
is
with
child
by
you
Launcelot
It
is
much
that
the
Moor
should
be
more
than
reason
but
if
she
be
less
than
an
honest
woman
she
is
indeed
more
than
I
took
her
for
How
every
fool
can
play
upon
the
word
I
think
the
best
grace
of
wit
will
shortly
turn
into
silence
and
discourse
grow
commendable
in
none
only
but
parrots
Go
in
sirrah
bid
them
prepare
for
dinner
That
is
done
sir
they
have
all
stomachs
Goodly
Lord
what
a
witsnapper
are
you
Then
bid
them
prepare
dinner
That
is
done
too
sir
only
cover
is
the
word
Will
you
cover
then
sir
Not
so
sir
neither
I
know
my
duty
Yet
more
quarrelling
with
occasion
Wilt
thou
show
the
whole
wealth
of
thy
wit
in
an
instant
I
pray
thee
understand
a
plain
man
in
his
plain
meaning
go
to
thy
fellows
bid
them
cover
the
table
serve
in
the
meat
and
we
will
come
in
to
dinner
For
the
table
sir
it
shall
be
servd
in
for
the
meat
sir
it
shall
be
coverd
for
your
coming
in
to
dinner
sir
why
let
it
be
as
humours
and
conceits
shall
govern
dear
discretion
how
his
words
are
suited
The
fool
hath
planted
in
his
memory
An
army
of
good
words
and
I
do
know
many
fools
that
stand
in
better
place
Garnishd
like
him
that
for
a
tricksy
word
Defy
the
matter
How
cheerst
thou
Jessica
And
now
good
sweet
say
thy
opinion
How
dost
thou
like
the
Lord
Bassanios
wife
Past
all
expressing
It
is
very
meet
The
Lord
Bassanio
live
an
upright
life
For
having
such
a
blessing
in
his
lady
He
finds
the
joys
of
heaven
here
on
earth
And
if
on
earth
he
do
not
merit
it
In
reason
he
should
never
come
to
heaven
Why
if
two
gods
should
play
some
heavenly
match
And
on
the
wager
lay
two
earthly
women
And
Portia
one
there
must
be
something
else
Pawnd
with
the
other
for
the
poor
rude
world
Hath
not
her
fellow
Even
such
a
husband
Hast
thou
of
me
as
she
is
for
a
wife
Nay
but
ask
my
opinion
too
of
that
I
will
anon
first
let
us
go
to
dinner
Nay
let
me
praise
you
while
I
have
a
stomach
No
pray
thee
let
it
serve
for
tabletalk
Then
howsomeer
thou
speakst
mong
other
things
I
shall
digest
it
Well
Ill
set
you
forth
I
Venice
The
court
of
justice
Enter
the
the
and
What
is
Antonio
here
Ready
so
please
your
Grace
I
am
sorry
for
thee
thou
art
come
to
answer
stony
adversary
an
inhuman
wretch
Uncapable
of
pity
void
and
empty
From
any
dram
of
mercy
I
have
heard
Your
Grace
hath
taen
great
pains
to
qualify
His
rigorous
course
but
since
he
stands
obdurate
And
that
no
lawful
means
can
carry
me
Out
of
his
envys
reach
I
do
oppose
My
patience
to
his
fury
and
am
armd
To
suffer
with
a
quietness
of
spirit
The
very
tyranny
and
rage
of
his
Go
one
and
call
the
Jew
into
the
court
He
is
ready
at
the
door
he
comes
my
lord
Enter
Make
room
and
let
him
stand
before
our
face
Shylock
the
world
thinks
and
I
think
so
too
That
thou
but
leadest
this
fashion
of
thy
malice
To
the
last
hour
of
act
and
then
tis
thought
Thoult
show
thy
mercy
and
remorse
more
strange
Than
is
thy
strange
apparent
cruelty
And
where
thou
now
exacts
the
penalty
Which
is
a
pound
of
this
poor
merchants
flesh
Thou
wilt
not
only
loose
the
forfeiture
But
touchd
with
human
gentleness
and
love
Forgive
a
moiety
of
the
principal
Glancing
an
eye
of
pity
on
his
losses
That
have
of
late
so
huddled
on
his
back
Enow
to
press
a
royal
merchant
down
And
pluck
commiseration
of
his
state
From
brassy
bosoms
and
rough
hearts
of
flint
From
stubborn
Turks
and
Tartars
never
traind
To
offices
of
tender
courtesy
We
all
expect
a
gentle
answer
Jew
I
have
possessd
your
Grace
of
what
I
purpose
And
by
our
holy
Sabbath
have
I
sworn
To
have
the
due
and
forfeit
of
my
bond
If
you
deny
it
let
the
danger
light
Upon
your
charter
and
your
citys
freedom
Youll
ask
me
why
I
rather
choose
to
have
weight
of
carrion
flesh
than
to
receive
Three
thousand
ducats
Ill
not
answer
that
But
say
it
is
my
humour
is
it
answerd
What
if
my
house
be
troubled
with
a
rat
And
I
be
pleasd
to
give
ten
thousand
ducats
To
have
it
band
What
are
you
answerd
yet
Some
men
there
are
love
not
a
gaping
pig
Some
that
are
mad
if
they
behold
a
cat
And
others
when
the
bagpipe
sings
i
th
nose
Cannot
contain
their
urine
for
affection
Mistress
of
passion
sways
it
to
the
mood
Of
what
it
likes
or
loathes
Now
for
your
answer
As
there
is
no
firm
reason
to
be
rendred
Why
he
cannot
abide
a
gaping
pig
Why
he
a
harmless
necessary
cat
Why
he
a
woollen
bagpipe
but
of
force
Must
yield
to
such
inevitable
shame
As
to
offend
himself
being
offended
So
can
I
give
no
reason
nor
I
will
not
More
than
a
lodgd
hate
and
a
certain
loathing
I
bear
Antonio
that
I
follow
thus
losing
suit
against
him
Are
you
answered
This
is
no
answer
thou
unfeeling
man
To
excuse
the
current
of
thy
cruelty
I
am
not
bound
to
please
thee
with
my
answers
Do
all
men
kill
the
things
they
do
not
love
Hates
any
man
the
thing
he
would
not
kill
Every
offence
is
not
a
hate
at
first
What
wouldst
thou
have
a
serpent
sting
thee
twice
I
pray
you
think
you
question
with
the
Jew
You
may
as
well
go
stand
upon
the
beach
And
bid
the
main
flood
bate
his
usual
height
You
may
as
well
use
question
with
the
wolf
Why
he
hath
made
the
ewe
bleat
for
the
lamb
You
may
as
well
forbid
the
mountain
pines
To
wag
their
high
tops
and
to
make
no
noise
When
they
are
fretten
with
the
gusts
of
heaven
You
may
as
well
do
anything
most
hard
As
seek
to
soften
that
than
which
whats
harder
His
jewish
heart
Therefore
I
do
beseech
you
Make
no
moe
offers
use
no
farther
means
But
with
all
brief
and
plain
conveniency
Let
me
have
judgment
and
the
Jew
his
will
For
thy
three
thousand
ducats
here
is
six
If
every
ducat
in
six
thousand
ducats
Were
in
six
parts
and
every
part
a
ducat
I
would
not
draw
them
I
would
have
my
bond
How
shalt
thou
hope
for
mercy
rendring
none
What
judgment
shall
I
dread
doing
no
wrong
You
have
among
you
many
a
purchasd
slave
Which
fike
your
asses
and
your
dogs
and
mules
You
use
in
abject
and
in
slavish
parts
Because
you
bought
them
shall
I
say
to
you
Let
them
be
free
marry
them
to
your
heirs
Why
sweat
they
under
burdens
let
their
beds
Be
made
as
soft
as
yours
and
let
their
palates
Be
seasond
with
such
viands
You
will
answer
The
slaves
are
ours
So
do
I
answer
you
The
pound
of
flesh
which
I
demand
of
him
Is
dearly
bought
tis
mine
and
I
will
have
it
If
you
deny
me
fie
upon
your
law
There
is
no
force
in
the
decrees
of
Venice
I
stand
for
judgment
answer
shall
I
have
it
Upon
my
power
I
may
dismiss
this
court
Unless
Bellario
a
learned
doctor
Whom
I
have
sent
for
to
determine
this
Come
here
today
My
lord
here
stays
without
messenger
with
letters
from
the
doctor
New
come
from
Padua
Bring
us
the
letters
call
the
messenger
Good
cheer
Antonio
What
man
courage
yet
The
Jew
shall
have
my
flesh
blood
bones
and
all
Ere
thou
shalt
lose
for
me
one
drop
of
blood
I
am
a
tainted
wether
of
the
flock
Meetest
for
death
the
weakest
kind
of
fruit
Drops
earliest
to
the
ground
and
so
let
me
You
cannot
better
be
employd
Bassanio
Than
to
live
still
and
write
mine
epitaph
Enter
dressed
like
a
lawyers
clerk
Came
you
from
Padua
from
Bellario
From
both
my
lord
Bellario
greets
your
Grace
Presents
a
letter
Why
dost
thou
whet
thy
knife
so
earnestly
To
cut
the
forfeiture
from
that
bankrupt
there
Not
on
thy
sole
but
on
thy
soul
harsh
Jew
Thou
makst
thy
knife
keen
but
no
metal
can
No
not
the
hangmans
axe
bear
half
the
keenness
Of
thy
sharp
envy
Can
no
prayers
pierce
thee
No
none
that
thou
hast
wit
enough
to
make
be
thou
damnd
inexecrable
dog
And
for
thy
life
let
justice
be
accusd
Thou
almost
makst
me
waver
in
my
faith
To
hold
opinion
with
Pythagoras
That
souls
of
animals
infuse
themselves
Into
the
trunks
of
men
Thy
currish
spirit
Governd
a
wolf
who
hangd
for
human
slaughter
Even
from
the
gallows
did
his
fell
soul
fleet
And
whilst
thou
layest
in
thy
unhallowed
dam
Infusd
itself
in
thee
for
thy
desires
Are
wolfish
bloody
starvd
and
ravenous
Till
thou
canst
rail
the
seal
from
off
my
bond
Thou
but
offendst
thy
lungs
to
speak
so
loud
Repair
thy
wit
good
youth
or
it
will
fall
To
cureless
ruin
I
stand
here
for
law
This
letter
from
Bellario
doth
commend
young
and
learned
doctor
to
our
court
Where
is
he
He
attendeth
here
hard
by
To
know
your
answer
whether
youll
admit
him
With
all
my
heart
Some
three
or
four
of
you
Go
give
him
courteous
conduct
to
this
place
Meantime
the
court
shall
hear
Bellarios
letter
Reads
Your
Grace
shall
understand
that
at
the
receipt
of
your
letter
I
am
very
sick
but
in
the
instant
that
your
messenger
came
in
loving
visitation
was
with
me
a
young
doctor
of
Rome
his
name
is
Balthazar
I
acquainted
him
with
the
cause
in
controversy
between
the
Jew
and
Antonio
the
merchant
we
turnd
oer
many
books
together
he
is
furnished
with
my
opinion
which
bettered
with
his
own
learningthe
greatness
whereof
I
cannot
enough
commend
comes
with
him
at
my
importunity
to
fill
up
your
Graces
request
in
my
stead
I
beseech
you
let
his
lack
of
years
be
no
impediment
to
let
him
lack
a
reverend
estimation
for
I
never
knew
so
young
a
body
with
so
old
a
head
I
leave
him
to
your
gracious
acceptance
whose
trial
shall
better
publish
his
commendation
Enter
for
dressed
like
a
Doctor
of
Laws
hear
the
learnd
Bellario
what
he
writes
And
here
I
take
it
is
the
doctor
come
Give
me
your
hand
come
you
from
old
Bellario
I
did
my
lord
You
are
welcome
take
your
place
Are
you
acquainted
with
the
difference
That
holds
this
present
question
in
the
court
I
am
informed
throughly
of
the
cause
Which
is
the
merchant
here
and
which
the
Jew
Antonio
and
old
Shylock
both
stand
forth
Is
your
name
Shylock
Shylock
is
my
name
Of
a
strange
nature
is
the
suit
you
follow
Yet
in
such
rule
that
the
Venetian
law
Cannot
impugn
you
as
you
do
proceed
You
stand
within
his
danger
do
you
not
Ay
so
he
says
Do
you
confess
the
bond
I
do
Then
must
the
Jew
be
merciful
On
what
compulsion
must
I
Tell
me
that
The
quality
of
mercy
is
not
straind
It
droppeth
as
the
gentle
rain
from
heaven
Upon
the
place
beneath
It
is
twice
blest
It
blesseth
him
that
gives
and
him
that
takes
Tis
mightiest
in
the
mightiest
it
becomes
The
throned
monarch
better
than
his
crown
His
sceptre
shows
the
force
of
temporal
power
The
attribute
to
awe
and
majesty
Wherein
doth
sit
the
dread
and
fear
of
kings
But
mercy
is
above
this
sceptred
sway
It
is
enthroned
in
the
hearts
of
kings
It
is
an
attribute
to
God
himself
And
earthly
power
doth
then
show
likest
Gods
When
mercy
seasons
justice
Therefore
Jew
Though
justice
be
thy
plea
consider
this
That
in
the
course
of
justice
none
of
us
Should
see
salvation
we
do
pray
for
mercy
And
that
same
prayer
doth
teach
us
all
to
render
The
deeds
of
mercy
I
have
spoke
thus
much
To
mitigate
the
justice
of
thy
plea
Which
if
thou
follow
this
strict
court
of
Venice
Must
needs
give
sentence
gainst
the
merchant
there
My
deeds
upon
my
head
I
crave
the
law
The
penalty
and
forfeit
of
my
bond
Yes
here
I
tender
it
for
him
in
the
court
Yea
twice
the
sum
if
that
will
not
suffice
I
will
be
bound
to
pay
it
ten
times
oer
On
forfeit
of
my
hands
my
head
my
heart
If
this
will
not
suffice
it
must
appear
That
malice
bears
down
truth
And
I
beseech
you
Wrest
once
the
law
to
your
authority
To
do
a
great
right
do
a
little
wrong
And
curb
this
cruel
devil
of
his
will
It
must
not
be
there
is
no
power
in
Venice
Can
alter
a
decree
established
Twill
be
recorded
for
a
precedent
And
many
an
error
by
the
same
example
Will
rush
into
the
state
it
cannot
be
Daniel
come
to
judgment
Yea
a
Daniel
wise
young
judge
how
I
do
honour
thee
I
pray
you
let
me
look
upon
the
bond
Here
tis
most
reverend
Doctor
here
it
is
Shylock
theres
thrice
thy
money
offred
thee
An
oath
an
oath
I
have
an
oath
in
heaven
Shall
I
lay
perjury
upon
my
soul
No
not
for
Venice
Why
this
bond
is
forfeit
And
lawfully
by
this
the
Jew
may
claim
pound
of
flesh
to
be
by
him
cut
off
Nearest
the
merchants
heart
Be
merciful
Take
thrice
thy
money
bid
me
tear
the
bond
When
it
is
paid
according
to
the
tenour
It
doth
appear
you
are
a
worthy
judge
You
know
the
law
your
exposition
Hath
been
most
sound
I
charge
you
by
the
law
Whereof
you
are
a
welldeserving
pillar
Proceed
to
judgment
By
my
soul
I
swear
There
is
no
power
in
the
tongue
of
man
To
alter
me
I
stay
here
on
my
bond
Most
heartily
I
do
beseech
the
court
To
give
the
judgment
Why
then
thus
it
is
You
must
prepare
your
bosom
for
his
knife
noble
judge
excellent
young
man
For
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
law
Hath
full
relation
to
the
penalty
Which
here
appeareth
due
upon
the
bond
Tis
very
true
wise
and
upright
judge
How
much
more
elder
art
thou
than
thy
looks
Therefore
lay
bare
your
bosom
Ay
his
breast
So
says
the
bond
doth
it
not
noble
judge
Nearest
his
heart
those
are
the
very
words
It
is
so
Are
there
balance
here
to
weigh
The
flesh
I
have
them
ready
Have
by
some
surgeon
Shylock
on
your
charge
To
stop
his
wounds
lest
he
do
bleed
to
death
Is
it
so
nominated
in
the
bond
It
is
not
so
expressd
but
what
of
that
Twere
good
you
do
so
much
for
charity
I
cannot
find
it
tis
not
in
the
bond
You
merchant
have
you
anything
to
say
But
little
I
am
armd
and
well
prepard
Give
me
your
hand
Bassanio
fare
you
well
Grieve
not
that
I
am
falln
to
this
for
you
For
herein
Fortune
shows
herself
more
kind
Than
is
her
custom
It
is
still
her
use
To
let
the
wretched
man
outlive
his
wealth
To
view
with
hollow
eye
and
wrinkled
brow
An
age
of
poverty
from
which
lingring
penance
Of
such
misery
doth
she
cut
me
off
Commend
me
to
your
honourable
wife
Tell
her
the
process
of
Antonios
end
Say
how
I
lovd
you
speak
me
fair
in
death
And
when
the
tale
is
told
bid
her
be
judge
Whether
Bassanio
had
not
once
a
love
Repent
but
you
that
you
shall
lose
your
friend
And
he
repents
not
that
he
pays
your
debt
For
if
the
Jew
do
cut
but
deep
enough
Ill
pay
it
instantly
with
all
my
heart
Antonio
I
am
married
to
a
wife
Which
is
as
dear
to
me
as
life
itself
But
life
itself
my
wife
and
all
the
world
Are
not
with
me
esteemd
above
thy
life
I
would
lose
all
ay
sacrifice
them
all
Here
to
this
devil
to
deliver
you
Your
wife
would
give
you
little
thanks
for
that
If
she
were
by
to
hear
you
make
the
offer
I
have
a
wife
who
I
protest
I
love
I
would
she
were
in
heaven
so
she
could
Entreat
some
power
to
change
this
currish
Jew
Tis
well
you
offer
it
behind
her
back
The
wish
would
make
else
an
unquiet
house
Aside
These
be
the
Christian
husbands
I
have
a
daughter
Would
any
of
the
stock
of
Barrabas
Had
been
her
husband
rather
than
a
Christian
We
trifle
time
I
pray
thee
pursue
sentence

of
that
same

flesh
is
thine
The
court
awards
it
and
the
law
doth
give
it
Most
rightful

And
you
must
cut
this
flesh
from
off
his
breast
The
law
allows
it
and
the

awards

Most

Come

This

The
words
expressly
are

Take
then
thy

But
in
the
cutting

if
thou
dost
shed
One

Are

Therefore

Take

Give

Thou

Why

give

Ill

question
Tarry
Jew
The
law
hath
yet
another
hold
on
you
It
is
enacted
in
the
laws
of
Venice
If
it
be
proved
against
an
alien
That
by
direct
or
indirect
attempts
He
seek
the
life
of
any
citizen
The
party
gainst
the
which
he
doth
contrive
Shall
seize

half
his
goods
the

half
Comes
to
the

coffer
of

state
And
the
offenders
life
lies
in
the
mercy
Of
the
Duke
only
gainst
all
other
voice
In
which
predicament
I
say
thou
standst
For
it
appears
by
manifest
proceeding
That
indirectly
and
directly
too
Thou
hast
contrived
against
the
very
life
Of
the
defendant
and
thou
hast
incurrd
The
danger
formerly
by
me
rehearsd
Down
therefore
and
beg
mercy
of
the
Duke
Beg
that
thou
mayst
have
leave
to
hang
thyself
And
yet
thy
wealth
being
forfeit
to
the
state
Thou
hast
not
left
the
value
of
a
cord
Therefore
thou
must
be
hangd
at
the
states
charge
That
thou
shalt
see
the
difference
of
our
spirit
I
pardon
thee
thy
life
before
thou
ask
it
For
half
thy
wealth
it
is
Antonios
The
other
half
comes
to
the
general
state
Which
humbleness
may
drive
unto
a
fine
Ay
for
the
state
not
for
Antonio
Nay
take
my
life
and
all
pardon
not
that
You
take
my
house
when
you
do
take
the
prop
That
doth
sustain
my
house
you
take
my
life
When
you
do
take
the
means
whereby
I
live
What
mercy
can
you
render
him
Antonio
halter
gratis
nothing
else
for
Gods
sake
So
please
my
lord
the
Duke
and
all
the
court
To
quit
the
fine
for
one
half
of
his
goods
I
am
content
so
he
will
let
me
have
The
other
half
in
use
to
render
it
Upon
his
death
unto
the
gentleman
That
lately
stole
his
daughter
Two
things
provided
more
that
for
this
favour
He
presently
become
a
Christian
The
other
that
he
do
record
a
gift
Here
in
the
court
of
all
he
dies
possessd
Unto
his
son
Lorenzo
and
his
daughter
He
shall
do
this
or
else
I
do
recant
The
pardon
that
I
late
pronounced
here
Art
thou
contented
Jew
What
dost
thou
say
I
am
content
Clerk
draw
a
deed
of
gift
I
pray
you
give
me
leave
to
go
from
hence
I
am
not
well
send
the
deed
after
me
And
I
will
sign
it
Get
thee
gone
but
do
it
In
christning
shalt
thou
have
two
godfathers
Had
I
been
judge
thou
shouldst
have
had
ten
more
To
bring
thee
to
the
gallows
not
to
the
font
Sir
I
entreat
you
home
with
me
to
dinner
I
humbly
do
desire
your
Grace
of
pardon
I
must
away
this
night
toward
Padua
And
it
is
meet
I
presently
set
forth
I
am
sorry
that
your
leisure
serves
you
not
Antonio
gratify
this
gentleman
For
in
my
mind
you
are
much
bound
to
him
Most
worthy
gentleman
I
and
my
friend
Have
by
your
wisdom
been
this
day
acquitted
Of
grievous
penalties
in
lieu
whereof
Three
thousand
ducats
due
unto
the
Jew
We
freely
cope
your
courteous
pains
withal
And
stand
indebted
over
and
above
In
love
and
service
to
you
evermore
He
is
well
paid
that
is
well
satisfied
And
I
delivering
you
am
satisfied
And
therein
do
account
myself
well
paid
My
mind
was
never
yet
more
mercenary
I
pray
you
know
me
when
we
meet
again
I
wish
you
well
and
so
I
take
my
leave
Dear
sir
of
force
I
must
attempt
you
further
Take
some
remembrance
of
us
as
a
tribute
Not
as
fee
Grant
me
two
things
I
pray
you
Not
to
deny
me
and
to
pardon
me
You
press
me
far
and
therefore
I
will
yield
To
Give
me
your
gloves
Ill
wear
them
for
your
sake
To
And
for
your
love
Ill
take
this
ring
from
you
Do
not
draw
back
your
hand
Ill
take
no
more
And
you
in
love
shall
not
deny
me
this
This
ring
good
sir
alas
it
is
a
trifle
I
will
not
shame
myself
to
give
you
this
I
will
have
nothing
else
but
only
this
And
now
methinks
I
have
a
mind
to
it
Theres
more
depends
on
this
than
on
the
value
The
dearest
ring
in
Venice
will
I
give
you
And
find
it
out
by
proclamation
Only
for
this
I
pray
you
pardon
me
I
see
sir
you
are
liberal
in
offers
You
taught
me
first
to
beg
and
now
methinks
You
teach
me
how
a
beggar
should
be
answerd
Good
sir
this
ring
was
given
me
by
my
wife
And
when
she
put
it
on
she
made
me
vow
That
I
should
neither
sell
nor
give
nor
lose
it
That
scuse
serves
many
men
to
save
their
gifts
And
if
your
wife
be
not
a
mad
woman
And
know
how
well
I
have
deservd
this
ring
She
would
not
hold
out
enemy
for
ever
For
giving
it
to
me
Well
peace
be
with
you
My
Lord
Bassanio
let
him
have
the
ring
Let
his
deservings
and
my
love
withal
Be
valued
gainst
your
wifes
commandment
Go
Gratiano
run
and
overtake
him
Give
him
the
ring
and
bring
him
if
thou
canst
Unto
Antonios
house
Away

haste
Come

is

discuss
the
humour
of
this
love
to
Page
And
I
to
Ford
shall
eke
unfold
How
Falstaff
varlet
vile
His
dove
will
prove
his
gold
will
hold
And
his
soft
couch
defile
My
humour
shall
not
cool
I
will
incense
Page
to
deal
with
poison
I
will
possess
him
with
yellowness
for
the
revolt
of
mine
is
dangerous
That
is
my
true
humour
Thou
art
the
Mars
of
malcontents
I
second
thee
troop
on
room
in
the
Garter
Inn
Enter
and
I
will
not
lend
thee
a
penny
I
will
retort
the
sum
in
equipage
Not
a
penny
Why
then
the
worlds
mine
oyster
Which
I
with
sword
will
open
Not
a
penny
I
have
been
content

should
lay
my
countenance
to

grated

my
good
friends

reprieves
for
you

your
coachfellow
Nym

lookd
through
the
grate
like
a
geminy
of
baboons
I
am
damnd
in
hell
for
swearing
to
gentlemen
my
friends
you
were
good
soldiers
and
tall
fellows
and
when
Mistress
Bridget
lost
the
handle
of
her
fan
I
took
t
upon
mine
honour
thou
hadst
it
not
Didst
not

Hadst
thou
not
fifteen
pence
Reason

Thinkst

You

do
to
keep
the
terms
of
my
honour
precise
I
I
I
myself
sometimes
leaving
the
fear
of
God
on
the
left
hand
and
hiding
mine
honour
in
my
necessity
am
fain
to
shuffle
to
hedge

to
lurch
and
yet
you
rogue
will
ensconce
your
rags
your
catamountain
looks
your
redlattice
phrases
and
your
boldbeating
oaths
under

You

a
canaries
as
tis
wonderful
The
best
courtier
of
them
all
when
the
court
lay
at
Windsor
could
never
have
brought
her
to
such
a
canary
Yet
there
has
been
knights
and
lords
and
gentlemen
with
their
coaches
I
warrant
you
coach
after
coach
letter
after
letter
gift
after
gift
smelling
so
sweetly
all
musk
and
so
rushling
I
warrant
you
in
silk
and
gold
and
in
such
alligant
terms
and
in
such
wine
and
sugar
of
the
best
and
the
fairest
that
would
have
won
any
womans
heart
and
I
warrant
you
they
could
never
get
an
eyewink
of
her
I
had
myself
twenty
angels
given
me
this
morning
but
I
defy
all
angels
in
any
such
sort
as
they
say
but
in
the
way
of
honesty
and
I
warrant
you
they
could
never
get
her
so
much
as
sip
on
a
cup
with
the
proudest
of
them
all
and
yet
there
has
been
earls
nay
which
is
more
pensioners

I

you
all
is
one
with

Be
brief
my
good

Mercury
Marry
she

I
must
let
you

I
think

in
better
plight
for
a
lender
than
you
are
the
which
hath
something
emboldned
me
to
this
unseasond
intrusion
for
they
say
if
money
go
before
all
ways
do
lie
open
Money
is
a
good
soldier
sir
and
will
on
Troth
and
I
have
a
bag
of
money
here
troubles
me
if
you
will
help
to
bear
it
Sir
John
take
all
or
half
for
easing
me
of
the
carriage
Sir

know
not
how
I
may
deserve
to
be
your
porter
I
will
tell
you
sir
if
you
will
give
me
the
hearing
Speak
good
Master
Brook
I
shall
be
glad
to
be
your
servant
Sir
I
hear
you
are
a
scholarI
will
be
brief
with
you
and
you
have
been
a
man
long
known
to
me
though
I
had
never
so
good
means
as
desire
to
make
myself
acquainted
with
you
I
shall
discover
a
thing
to
you
wherein
I
must
very
much
lay
open
mine
own
imperfection
but
good
Sir
John
as
you
have
one
eye
upon
my
follies
as
you
hear
them
unfolded
turn
another
into
the
register
of
your
own
that
I
may
pass
with
a
reproof
the
easier
sith
you
yourself
know
how
easy
is
it
to
be
such
an
offender
Very
well
sir
proceed
There
is
a
gentlewoman
in
this
town
her
husbands
name
is
Ford
Well
sir
I
have
long
lovd
her
and
I
protest
to
you
bestowed
much
on
her
followed
her
with
a
doting
observance
engrossd
opportunities
to
meet
her
feed
every
slight
occasion
that
could
but
niggardly
give
me
sight
of
her
not
only
bought
many
presents
to
give
her
but
have
given
largely
to
many
to
know
what
she
would
have
given
briefly
I
have
pursud
her
as
love
hath
pursued
me
which
hath
been
on
the
wing
of
all
occasions
But
whatsoever
I
have
merited
either
in
my
mind
or
in
my
means
meed
I
am
sure
I
have
received
none
unless
experience
be
a
jewel
that
I
have
purchased
at
an
infinite
rate
and
that
hath
taught
me
to
say
this
Love
like
a
shadow
flies
when
substance
love
pursues
Pursuing
that
that
flies
and
flying
what
pursues
Have
you
receivd
no
promise
of
satisfaction
at
her
hands
Never
Have
you
importund
her
to
such
a
purpose
Never
Of
what
quality
was
your
love
then
Like
a
fair
house
built
on
another
mans
ground
so
that
I
have
lost
my
edifice
by
mistaking
the
place
where
erected
it
To
what
purpose
have
you
unfolded
this
to
me
When
I
have
told
you
that
I
have
told
you
all
Some
say
that
though
she
appear
honest
to
me
yet
in
other
places
she
enlargeth
her
mirth
so
far
that
there
is
shrewd
construction
made
of
her
Now
Sir
John
here
is
the
heart
of
my
purpose
you
are
a
gentleman
of
excellent
breeding
admirable
discourse
of
great
admittance
authentic
in
your
place
and
person
generally
allowd
for
your
many
warlike
courtlike
and
learned
preparations
sir
Believe
it
for
you
know
it
There
is
money
spend
it
spend
it
spend
more
spend
all
I
have
only
give
me
so
much
of
your
time
in
exchange
of
it
as
to
lay
an
amiable
siege
to
the
honesty
of
this
Fords
wife
use
your
art
of
wooing
win
her
to
consent
to
you
if
any
man
may
you
may
as
soon
as
any
Would
it
apply
well
to
the
vehemency
of
your
affection
that
I
should
win
what
you
would
enjoy
Methinks
you
prescribe
to
yourself
very
preposterously
understand
my
drift
She
dwells
so
securely
on
the
excellency
of
her
honour
that
the
folly
of
my
soul
dares
not
present
itself
she
is
too
bright
to
be
lookd
against
Now
could
I
come
to
her
with
any
detection
in
my
hand
my
desires
had
instance
and
argument
to
commend
themselves
I
could
drive
her
then
from
the
ward
of
her
purity
her
reputation
her
marriage
vow
and
a
thousand
other
her
defences
which
now
are
too
too
strongly
embattld
against
me
What
say

Sir
John

Brook

first
make
bold
with

Parson

with
my
aquavitae
bottle
or

My

past
my
wild
societies
And
tells
me

a
thing
impossible
I

thy

wealth
Was

motive
that
I
wood
thee
Anne
Yet
wooing

I
found
thee
of
more
value
Than
stamps
in
gold

sums
in
sealed
bags

the
very
riches
of
thyself
That
now
I
aim

an
Eves

Peerout

tameness
civility
and
patience

his
distemper

now
I
am
glad
the
fat
knight

not
here
Why
does
he
talk
of
him
Of
none
but
him
and
swears
he
was
carried
out
the
last
time
he
searchd
for
him
in
a
basket
protests
to
my
husband
he
is
now
here
and
hath
drawn
him
and
the
rest
of
their
company
from
their
sport
to
make
another
experiment
of
his
suspicion
But
I
am
glad
the
knight
is
not
here
now
he
shall
see
his
own
foolery
How

Mistress

kilnhole
Where

He

Neither

hath
an
abstract
for
the
remembrance
of
such
places
and
goes
to
them
by
his
note
There
is
no
hiding

the
house
Ill

If

no
womans
gown
big
enough
for

otherwise
he
might
put
on
a
hat
a
muffler
and
a
kerchief
and
so
escape
Good
hearts
devise
something
any
extremity
rather
than
a
mischief
My
Maids
aunt

fat
woman
of
Brainford

Good

not
strike
the
old
woman
Reenter
in
womans
clothes
and
Come
Mother
Prat

me
your
hand
Ill
prat

Beating

Out
of
my
door
you

baggage
you
polecat
you
ronyon
Out
out
Ill
conjure
you
Ill
fortunetell
you
Are
you
not
ashamd
I
think
you
have
killd
the
poor
woman
Nay
he
will
do
it
Tis
a
goodly
credit
for
you
Hang
her
witch
By
yea
and
no
I
think
the
oman
is
a
witch
indeed
I
like
not
when
a
oman
has
a
great
peard
I
spy
a
great
peard
under
his
muffler
Will
you
follow
gentlemen
I
beseech
you
follow
see
but
the
issue
of
my
jealousy
if
I
cry
out
thus
upon
no
trail
never
trust
me
when
I
open
again
Lets
obey
his
humour
a
little
further
Come
gentlemen
Trust
me
he
beat
him
most
pitifully
Nay
by
th
mass
that
he
did
not
he
beat
him
most
unpitifully
methought
Ill
have
the
cudgel
hallowd
and
hung
oer
the
altar
it
hath
done
meritorious
service
What
think
you
May
we
with
the
warrant
of
womanhood
and
the
witness
of
a
good
conscience
pursue
him
with
any
further
revenge
The
spirit
of
wantonness
is
sure
scard
out
of
him
if
the
devil
have
him
not
in
feesimple
with
fine
and
recovery
he
will
never
I
think
in
the
way
of
waste
attempt
us
again
Shall
we
tell
our
husbands
how
we
have
servd
him
Yes
by
all
means
if
it
be
but
to
scrape
the
figures
out
of
your
husbands
brains
If
they
can
find
in
their
hearts
the
poor
unvirtuous
fat
knight
shall
be
any
further
afflicted
we
two
will
still
be
the
ministers
Ill
warrant
theyll
have
him
publicly
shamd
and
methinks
there
would
be
no
period
to
the
jest
should
he
not
be
publicly
shamd
Come
to
the
forge
with
it
then
shape
it
I
would
not
have
things
cool
house
Enter
and
Tis
one
of
the
best
discretions
of
a
oman
as
ever
did
look
upon
And
did
he
send
you
both
these
letters
at
an
instant
Within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
Pardon
me
wife
Henceforth
do
what
thou
wilt
I
rather
will
suspect
the
sun
with
cold
Than
thee
with
wantonness
Now
doth
thy
honour
stand
In
him
that
was
of
late
an
heretic
As
firm
as
faith
Tis
well
tis
well
no
more
Be
not
as
extreme
in
submission
as
in
offence
But
let
our
plot
go
forward
Let
our
wives
Yet
once
again
to
make
us
public
sport
Appoint
a
meeting
with
this
old
fat
fellow
Where
we
may
take
him
and
disgrace
him
for
it
There
is
no
better
way
than
that
they
spoke
of
How
To
send
him
word
theyll
meet
him
in
the
Park
at
midnight
Fie
fie
hell
never
come
You
say
he
has
been
thrown
in
the
rivers
and
has
been
grievously
peaten
as
an
old
oman
methinks
there
should
be
terrors
in
him
that
he
should
not
come
methinks
his
flesh
is
punishd
he
shall
have
no
desires
So
think
I
too
Devise
but
how
youll
use
him
when
he
comes
And
let
us
two
devise
to
bring
him
thither
There
is
an
old
tale
goes
that
Heme
the
Hunter
Sometime
a
keeper
here
in
Windsor
Forest
Doth
all
the
wintertime
at
still
midnight
Walk
round
about
an
oak
with
great
raggd
horns
And
there
he
blasts
the
tree
and
takes
the
cattle
And
makes
milchkine
yield
blood
and
shakes
a
chain
In
a
most
hideous
and
dreadful
manner
You
have
heard
of
such
a
spirit
and
well
you
know
The
superstitious
idleheaded
eld
Receivd
and
did
deliver
to
our
age
This
tale
of
Heme
the
Hunter
for
a
truth
Why
yet
there
want
not
many
that
do
fear
In
deep
of
night
to
walk
by
this
Hernes
oak
But
what
of
this
Marry
this
is
our
device
That
Falstaff
at
that
oak
shall
meet
with
us
Disguisd
like
Heme
with
huge
horns
on
his
head
Well
let
it
not
be
doubted
but
hell
come
And
in
this
shape
When
you
have
brought
him
thither
What
shall
be
done
with
him
What
is
your
plot
That
likewise
have
we
thought
upon
and
thus
Nan
Page
my
daughter
and
my
little
son
And
three
or
four
more
of
their
growth
well
dress
Like
urchins
ouphes
and
fairies
green
and
white
With
rounds
of
waxen
tapers
on
their
heads
And
rattles
in
their
hands
upon
a
sudden
As
Falstaff
she
and
I
are
newly
met
Let
them
from
forth
a
sawpit
rush
at
once
With
some
diffused
song
upon
their
sight
We
two
in
great
amazedness
will
fly
Then
let
them
all
encircle
him
about
And
fairylike
to
pinch
the
unclean
knight
And
ask
him
why
that
hour
of
fairy
revel
In
their
so
sacred
paths
he
dares
to
tread
In
shape
profane
And
till
he
tell
the
truth
Let
the
supposed
fairies
pinch
him
sound
And
burn
him
with
their
tapers
The
truth
being
known
Well
all
present
ourselves
dishorn
the
spirit
And
mock
him
home
to
Windsor
The
children
must
Be
practisd
well
to
this
or
theyll
nevr
do
t
I
will
teach
the
children
their
behaviours
and
I
will
be
like
a
jackanapes
also
to
burn
the
knight
with
my
taber
That
will
be
excellent
Ill
go
buy
them
vizards
My
Nan
shall
be
the
Queen
of
all
the
Fairies
Finely
attired
in
a
robe
of
white
That
silk
will
I
go
buy
Aside
And
in
that
time
Shall
Master
Slender
steal
my
Nan
away
And
marry
her
at
EtonGo
send
to
Falstaff
straight
Nay
Ill
to
him
again
in
name
of
Brook
Hell
tell
me
all
his
purpose
Sure
hell
come
Fear
not
you
that
Go
get
us
properties
And
tricking
for
our
fairies
Let
us
about
it
It
is
admirable
pleasures
and
fery
honest
knaveries
Go
Mistress
Ford
Send
Quickly
to
Sir
John

know
his
mind
Ill
to
the
Doctor

hath
my
good
will
And
none
but
he
to
marry
with
Nan
Page
That
Slender
though
well
landed
is
an
idiot
And
he
my
husband
best
of
all
affects
The
Doctor
is
well
moneyd
and
his
friends
Potent
at
court

have
her
Though
twenty
thousand
worthier
come
to
crave
her
Master
Fenton

not
to
me
my
mind
is
heavy
I
will
give
over
all
Yet

Assist
me
in
my
purpose
And
as
I
am
a
gentleman
Ill

hundred
pound
in
gold

than
your
loss
I
will
hear
you
Master
Fenton
and
I
will
at
the
least
keep
your
counsel
From
time
to
time
I
have
acquainted
you
With
the
dear
love
I
bear
to
fair
Anne
Page
Who
mutually
hath
answerd
my
affection
So
far
forth
as
herself
might
be
her
chooser
Even
to
my
wish
I
have
a
letter
from
her
Of
such
contents
as
you
will
wonder
at
The
mirth
whereof
so
larded
with
my
matter
That
neither
singly
can
be
manifested
Without
the
show
of
both
Fat
Falstaff
Hath
a
great
scene
The
image
of
the
jest
Ill
show
you
here
at
large
Hark
good
mine
host
Tonight
at
Hemes
oak
just
twixt
twelve
and
one
Must
my
sweet
Nan
present
the
Fairy
Queen
The
purpose
why
is
herein
which
disguise
While
other
jests
are
something
rank
on
foot
Her
father
hath
commanded
her
to
slip
Away
with
Slender
and
with
him
at
Eton
Immediately
to
marry
she
hath
consented
Now
sir
Her
mother
even
strong
against
that
match
And
firm
for
Doctor
Caius
hath
appointed
That
he
shall
likewise
shuffle
her
away
While
other
sports
are
tasking
of
their
minds
And
at
the
deanry
where
a
priest
attends
Straight
marry
her
To
this
her
mothers
plot
She
seemingly
obedient
likewise
hath
Made
promise
to
the
doctor
Now
thus
it
rests
Her
father
means
she
shall
be
all
in
white
And
in
that
habit
when
Slender
sees
his
time
To
take
her
by
the
hand
and
bid
her
go
She
shall
go
with
him
her
mother
hath
intended
The
better
to
denote
her
to
the
doctor
For
they
must
all
be
maskd
and
vizarded
That
quaint
in
green
she
shall
be
loose
enrobd
With
ribands
pendent
flaring
bout
her
head
And
when
the
doctor
spies
his
vantage
ripe
To
pinch
her
by
the
hand
and
on
that
token
The
maid
hath
given
consent
to
go
with
him
Which
means
she
to
deceive
father
or
mother
Both
my
good
host
to
go
along
with
me
And
here
it
reststhat
youll
procure
the
vicar
To
stay
for
me
at
church
twixt
twelve
and
one
And
in
the
lawful
name
of
marrying
To
give
our
hearts
united
ceremony
Well
husband
your
device
Ill
to
the
vicar
Bring
you
the
maid
you
shall
not
lack
a
priest
So
shall
I
evermore
be
bound
to
thee
Besides
Ill
make
a
present
recompense
The
Garter
Inn
Enter
and
Prithee
no
more
prattling
go
Ill
hold
This
is
the
third
time
I
hope
good
luck
lies
in
odd
numbers
Away
go
they
say
there
is
divinity
in
odd
numbers
either
in
nativity
chance
or
death
Away
Ill
provide
you
a
chain
and
Ill
do
what
I
can
to
get
you
a
pair
of
horns
Away
I
say

up
your
head
and
mince
Enter

from

Master

like
a
poor
old

That
same
knave
Ford

husband
hath
the
finest
mad
devil
of
jealousy
in
him
Master
Brook
that
ever
governd
frenzy
I
will
tell
youhe

me
grievously
in
the
shape
of
a
woman
for
in
the
shape
of
man
Master
Brook

deanery
and
dispatch
it
quickly
Go
before
into
the
Park
we
two
must
go
together
I
know
vat
I
have
to
do
adieu
Fare
you
well
sir
will
not
rejoice
so
much
at
the
abuse
of
Falstaff
as
he
will
chafe
at
the
doctors
marrying
my
daughter
but
tis
no
matter
better
a
little
chiding
than
a
great
deal
of
heartbreak
Where
is
Nan
now
and
her
troop
of
fairies
and
the
Welsh
devil
Hugh
They
are
all
couchd
in
a
pit
hard
by
Hemes
oak
with
obscurd
lights
which
at
the
very
instant
of
Falstaffs
and
our
meeting
they
will
at
once
display
to
the
night
That
cannot
choose
but
amaze
him
If
he
be
not
amazd
he
will
be
mockd
if
he
be
amazd
he
will
every
way
be
mockd
Well
betray
him
finely
Against
such
lewdsters
and
their
lechery
Those
that
betray
them
do
no
treachery
The
hour
draws
on
To
the
oak

The
Windsor
bell
hath
struck

the

Now

for
thy
Europa

on
thy
horns
powerful
love
that
in
some
respects
makes
a
beast
a
man
in
some
other
a
man
a
beast
You
were
also
Jupiter
a
swan
for
the
love
of
Leda
omnipotent
love
how
near
the
god
drew
to
the
complexion
of
a
goose
fault
done
first
in
the
form
of

beastO
Jove

beastly
faultand
then

When

in
thy
birth
With
trialfire
touch
me
his
fingerend
If
he
be
chaste
the
flame
will
back
descend
And
turn
him
to
no
pain
but
if
he
start
It
is
the
flesh
of
a
corrupted
heart
trial
come
Come
will
this
wood
take
fire
They
put
the
tapers
to
his
fingers
and
he
starts
Oh
oh
oh
Corrupt
corrupt
and
tainted
in
desire
About
him
fairies
sing
a
scornful
rhyme
And
as
you
trip
still
pinch
him
to
your
time
Fie
on
sinful
fantasy
Fie
on
lust
and
luxury
Lust
is
but
a
bloody
fire
Kindled
with
unchaste
desire
Fed
in
heart
whose
flames
aspire
As
thoughts
do
blow
them
higher
and
higher
Pinch
him
fairies
mutually
Pinch
him
for
his
villainy
Pinch
him
and
burn
him
and
turn
him
about
Till
candles
and
starlight
and
moonshine
be
out
During
this
song
they
pinch
comes
one
way
and
steals
away
a
fairy
in
green
another
way
and
takes
off
a
fairy
in
white
and
steals
away
noise
of
hunting
is
heard
within
All
the
fairies
run
away
pulls
off
his
bucks
head
and
rises
Enter
and
Nay
do
not
fly
I
think
we
have
watchd
you
now
Will
none
but
Heme
the
Hunter
serve
your
turn
I
pray
you
come
hold
up
the
jest
no
higher
Now
good
Sir
John
how
like
you
Windsor
wives
See
you
these
husband
Do
not
these
fair
yokes
Become
the
forest
better
than
the
town
Now
sir
whos
a
cuckold
now
Master
Brook
Falstaffs
a
knave
a
cuckoldly
knave
here
are
his
horns
Master
Brook
and
Master
Brook
he
hath
enjoyed
nothing
of
Fords
but
his
buckbasket
his
cudgel
and
twenty
pounds
of
money
which
must
be
paid
to
Master
Brook
his

are
arrested
for

Master
Brook
Sir
John
we
have
had
ill
luck
we
could
never
meet
I
will
never
take
you
for
my
love
again
but
I
will
always
count
you
my
deer
I
do
begin
to
perceive
that
I
am
made
an
ass
Ay
and
an
ox
too
both
the
proofs
are
extant
And
these
are
not
fairies
I
was
three
or
four
times
in
the
thought
they
were
not
fairies
and
yet
the
guiltiness
of
my
mind
the
sudden
surprise
of
my
powers
drove
the
grossness
of
the
foppery
into
a
receivd
belief
in
despite
of
the
teeth
of
all
rhyme
and
reason
that
they
were
fairies
See
now
how
wit
may
be
made
a
JackaLent
when
tis
upon
ill
employment
Sir
John
Falstaff
serve
Got
and
leave
your
desires
and
fairies
will
not
pinse
you
Well
said
fairy
Hugh
And
leave
you
your
jealousies
too
I
pray
you
I
will
never
mistrust
my
wife
again
till
thou
art
able
to
woo
her
in
good
English
Have
I
laid
my
brain
in
the
sun
and
dried
it
that
it
wants
matter
to
prevent
so
gross
oerreaching
as
this
Am
I
ridden
with
a
Welsh
goat
too
Shall
I
have
a
coxcomb
of
frieze
Tis
time
I
were
chokd
with
a
piece
of
toasted
cheese
Seese
is
not
good
to
give
putter
your
belly
is
all
putter
Seese
and
putter
Have
I
livd
to
stand
at
the
taunt
of
one
that
makes
fritters
of
English
This
is
enough
to
be
the
decay
of
lust
and
latewalking
through
the
realm
Why
Sir
John
do
you
think
though
we
would
have
thrust
virtue
out
of
our
hearts
by
the
head
and
shoulders
and
have
given
ourselves
without
scruple
to
hell
that
ever
the
devil
could
have
made
you
our
delight
What
a
hodgepudding
a
bag
of
flax
puffd
man
Old
cold
witherd
and
of
intolerable
entrails
And
one
that
is
as
slanderous
as
Satan
And
as
poor
as
Job
And
as
wicked
as
his
wife
And
given
to
fornications
and
to
taverns
and
sack
and
wine
and
metheglins
and
to
drinkings
and
swearings
and
starings
pribbles
and
prabbles
Well
I
am
your
theme
you
have
the
start
of
me
I
am
dejected
I
am
not
able
to
answer
the
Welsh
flannel
ignorance
itself
is
a
plummet

Marry

Windsor

Master
Brook

pander
Over
and
above
that
you

sufferd
I

to

be
a
biting
affliction
Yet

Upon

you

What

If
I

for

he

Why

Did

I

Pardon

You

Hear
the
truth
of

You
would
have
married
her
most
shamefully
Where
there
was
no
proportion
held
in
love
The
truth
is
she
and
I
long
since
contracted
Are
now
so
sure
that
nothing
can
dissolve
us
Th
offence
is
holy
that
she
hath
committed
And
this
deceit
loses
the
name
of
craft
Of
disobedience
or
unduteous
title
Since
therein
she
doth
evitate
and
shun
thousand
irreligious
cursed
hours
Which
forced
marriage
would
have
brought
upon
her
Stand

Sir

Let

Sir

To
Master

you

shall
hold
your
word
For
he
tonight
shall
lie
with
Mistress
Ford
I
I
Athens
The
palace
of
Enter
and
Now
fair
Hippolyta
our
nuptial
hour
Draws
on
apace
four
happy
days
bring
in
Another
moon
but
methinks
how
slow
This
old
moon
wanes
She
lingers
my
desires
Like
to
a
stepdame
or
a
dowager
Long
withering
out
a
young
mans
revenue
Four
days
will
quickly
steep
themselves
in
night
Four
nights
will
quickly
dream
away
the
time
And
then
the
moon
like
to
a
silver
bow
Newbent
in
heaven
shall
behold
the
night
Of
our
solemnities
Go
Philostrate
Stir
up
the
Athenian
youth
to
merriments
Awake
the
pert
and
nimble
spirit
of
mirth
Turn
melancholy
forth
to
funerals
The
pale
companion
is
not
for
our
pomp
Hippolyta
I
wood
thee
with
my
sword
And
won
thy
love
doing
thee
injuries
But
I
will
wed
thee
in
another
key
With
pomp
with
triumph
and
with
revelling
Enter
and
his
daughter
and
Happy
be
Theseus
our
renowned
Duke
Thanks
good
Egeus
whats
the
news
with
thee
Full
of
vexation
come
I
with
complaint
Against
my
child
my
daughter
Hermia
Stand
forth
Demetrius
My
noble
lord
This
man
hath
my
consent
to
marry
her
Stand
forth
Lysander
And
my
gracious
Duke
This
man
hath
bewitchd
the
bosom
of
my
child
Thou
thou
Lysander
thou
hast
given
her
rhymes
And
interchangd
lovetokens
with
my
child
Thou
hast
by
moonlight
at
her
window
sung
With
feigning
voice
verses
of
feigning
love
And
stoln
the
impression
of
her
fantasy
With
bracelets
of
thy
hair
rings
gawds
conceits
Knacks
trifles
nosegays
sweetmeats
messengers
Of
strong
prevailment
in
unhardened
youth
With
cunning
hast
thou
filchd
my
daughters
heart
Turnd
her
obedience
which
is
due
to
me
To
stubborn
harshness
And
my
gracious
Duke
Be
it
so
she
will
not
here
before
your
Grace
Consent
to
marry
with
Demetrius
I
beg
the
ancient
privilege
of
Athens
As
she
is
mine
I
may
dispose
of
her
Which
shall
be
either
to
this
gentleman
Or
to
her
death
according
to
our
law
Immediately
provided
in
that
case
What
say
you
Hermia
Be
advisd
fair
maid
To
you
your
father
should
be
as
a
god
One
that
composd
your
beauties
yea
and
one
To
whom
you
are
but
as
a
form
in
wax
By
him
imprinted
and
within
his
power
To
leave
the
figure
or
disfigure
it
Demetrius
is
a
worthy
gentleman
So
is
Lysander
In
himself
he
is
But
in
this
kind
wanting
your
fathers
voice
The
other
must
be
held
the
worthier
I
would
my
father
lookd
but
with
my
eyes
Rather
your
eyes
must
with
his
judgment
look
I
do
entreat
your
Grace
to
pardon
me
I
know
not
by
what
power
I
am
made
bold
Nor
how
it
may
concern
my
modesty
In
such
a
presence
here
to
plead
my
thoughts
But
I
beseech
your
Grace
that
I
may
know
The
worst
that
may
befall
me
in
this
case
If
I
refuse
to
wed
Demetrius
Either
to
die
the
death
or
to
abjure
For
ever
the
society
of
men
Therefore
fair
Hermia
question
your
desires
Know
of
your
youth
examine
well
your
blood
Whether
if
you
yield
not
to
your
fathers
choice
You
can
endure
the
livery
of
a
nun
For
aye
to
be
shady
cloister
mewd
To
live
a
barren
sister
all
your
life
Chanting
faint
hymns
to
the
cold
fruitless
moon
Thriceblessed
they
that
master
so
their
blood
To
undergo
such
maiden
pilgrimage
But
earthlier
happy
is
the
rose
distilld
Than
that
which
withering
on
the
virgin
thorn
Grows
lives
and
dies
in
single
blessedness
So
will
I
grow
so
live
so
die
my
lord
Ere
I
will
yield
my
virgin
patent
up
Unto
his
lordship
whose
unwished
yoke
My
soul
consents
not
to
give
sovereignty
Take
time
to
pause
and
by
the
next
new
moon
The
sealingday
betwixt
my
love
and
me
For
everlasting
bond
of
fellowship
Upon
that
day
either
prepare
to
die
For
disobedience
to
your
fathers
will
Or
else
to
wed
Demetrius
as
he
would
Or
on
Dianas
altar
to
protest
For
aye
austerity
and
single
life
Relent
sweet
Hermia
and
Lysander
yield
Thy
crazed
title
to
my
certain
right
You
have
her
fathers
love
Demetrius
Let
me
have
Hermias
do
you
marry
him
Scornful
Lysander
true
he
hath
my
love
And
what
is
mine
my
love
shall
render
him
And
she
is
mine
and
all
my
right
of
her
I
do
estate
unto
Demetrius
I
am
my
lord
as
well
derivd
as
he
As
well
possessd
my
love
is
more
than
his
My
fortunes
every
way
as
fairly
rankd
If
not
with
vantage
as
Demetrius
And
which
is
more
than
all
these
boasts
can
be
I
am
belovd
of
beauteous
Hermia
Why
should
not
I
then
prosecute
my
right
Demetrius
Ill
avouch
it
to
his
head
Made
love
to
Nedars
daughter
Helena
And
won
her
soul
and
she
sweet
lady
dotes
Devoutly
dotes
dotes
in
idolatry
Upon
this
spotted
and
inconstant
man
I
must
confess
that
I
have
heard
so
much
And
with
Demetrius
thought
to
have
spoke
thereof
But
being
overfull
of
selfaffairs
My
mind
did
lose
it
But
Demetrius
come
And
come
Egeus
you
shall
go
with
me
I
have
some
private
schooling
for
you
both
For
you
fair
Hermia
look
you
arm
yourself
To
fit
your
fancies
to
your
fathers
will
Or
else
the
law
of
Athens
yields
you
up
Which
by
no
means
we
may
extenuate
To
death
or
to
a
vow
of
single
life
Come
my
Hippolyta
what
cheer
my
love
Demetrius
and
Egeus
go
along
I
must
employ
you
in
some
business
Against
our
nuptial
and
confer
with
you
Of
something
nearly
that
concerns
yourselves
With
duty
and
desire
we
follow
you
How
now
my
love
Why
is
your
cheek
so
pale
How
chance
the
roses
there
do
fade
so
fast
Belike
for
want
of
rain
which
I
could
well
Beteem
them
from
the
tempest
of
my
eyes
Ay
me
for
aught
that
I
could
ever
read
Could
ever
hear
by
tale
or
history
The
course
of
true
love
never
did
run
smooth
But
either
it
was
different
in
blood
cross
too
high
to
be
enthralld
to
low
Or
else
misgraffed
in
respect
of
years
spite
too
old
to
be
engagd
to
young
Or
else
it
stood
upon
the
choice
of
friends
hell
to
choose
love
by
anothers
eyes
Or
if
there
were
a
sympathy
in
choice
War
death
or
sickness
did
lay
siege
to
it
Making
it
momentary
as
a
sound
Swift
as
a
shadow
short
as
any
dream
Brief
as
the
lightning
in
the
collied
night
That
in
a
spleen
unfolds
both
heaven
and
earth
And
ere
a
man
hath
power
to
say
Behold
The
jaws
of
darkness
do
devour
it
up
So
quick
bright
things
come
to
confusion
If
then
true
lovers
have
ever
crossd
It
stands
as
an
edict
in
destiny
Then
let
us
teach
our
trial
patience
Because
it
is
a
customary
cross
As
due
to
love
as
thoughts
and
dreams
and
sighs
Wishes
and
tears
poor
Fancys
followers
good
persuasion
therefore
hear
me
Hermia
I
have
a
widow
aunt
a
dowager
Of
great
revenue
and
she
hath
no
child
From
Athens
is
her
house
remote
seven
leagues
And
she
respects
me
as
her
only
son
There
gentle
Hermia
may
I
marry
thee
And
to
that
place
the
sharp
Athenian
law
Cannot
pursue
us
If
thou
lovest
me
then
Steal
forth
thy
fathers
house
tomorrow
night
And
in
the
wood
a
league
without
the
town
Where
I
did
meet
thee
once
with
Helena
To
do
observance
to
a
morn
of
May
There
will
I
stay
for
thee
My
good
Lysander
I
swear
to
thee
by
Cupids
strongest
bow
By
his
best
arrow
with
the
golden
head
By
the
simplicity
of
Venus
doves
By
that
which
knitteth
souls
and
prospers
loves
And
by
that
fire
which
burnd
the
Carthage
Queen
When
the
false
Troyan
under
sail
was
seen
By
all
the
vows
that
ever
men
have
broke
In
number
more
than
ever
women
spoke
In
that
same
place
thou
hast
appointed
me
Tomorrow
truly
will
I
meet
with
thee
Keep
promise
love
Look
here
comes
Helena
Enter
God
speed
fair
Helena
Whither
away
Call
you
me
fair
That
fair
again
unsay
Demetrius
loves
your
fair
happy
fair
Your
eyes
are
lodestars
and
your
tongues
sweet
air
More
tuneable
than
lark
to
shepherds
ear
When
wheat
is
green
when
hawthorn
buds
appear
Sickness
is
catching
were
favour
so
Yours
would
I
catch
fair
Hermia
ere
I
go
My
ear
should
catch
your
voice
my
eye
your
eye
My
tongue
should
catch
your
tongues
sweet
melody
Were
the
world
mine
Demetrius
being
bated
The
rest
Id
give
to
be
to
you
translated
teach
me
how
you
look
and
with
what
art
You
sway
the
motion
of
Demetrius
heart
I
frown
upon
him
yet
he
loves
me
still
that
your
frowns
would
teach
my
smiles
such
skill
I
give
him
curses
yet
he
gives
me
love
that
my
prayers
could
such
affection
move
The
more
I
hate
the
more
he
follows
me
The
more
I
love
the
more
he
hateth
me
His
folly
Helena
is
no
fault
of
mine
None
but
your
beauty
would
that
fault
were
mine
Take
comfort
he
no
more
shall
see
my
face
Lysander
and
myself
will
fly
this
place
Before
the
time
I
did
Lysander
see
Seemd
Athens
as
a
paradise
to
me
then
what
graces
in
my
love
do
dwell
That
he
hath
turnd
a
heaven
unto
a
hell
Helen
to
you
our
minds
we
will
unfold
Tomorrow
night
when
Phoebe
doth
behold
Her
silver
visage
in
the
watry
glass
Decking
with
liquid
pearl
the
bladed
grass
time
that
lovers
flights
doth
still
conceal
Through
Athens
gates
have
we
devisd
to
steal
And
in
the
wood
where
often
you
and
I
Upon
faint
primrose
beds
were
wont
to
lie
Emptying
our
bosoms
of
their
counsel
sweet
There
my
Lysander
and
myself
shall
meet
And
thence
from
Athens
turn
away
our
eyes
To
seek
new
friends
and
stranger
companies
Farewell
sweet
playfellow
pray
thou
for
us
And
good
luck
grant
thee
thy
Demetrius
Keep
word
Lysander
we
must
starve
our
sight
From
lovers
food
till
morrow
deep
midnight
I
will
my
Hermia
As
you
on
him
Demetrius
dote
on
you
How
happy
some
oer
other
some
can
be
Through
Athens
I
am
thought
as
fair
as
she
But
what
of
that
Demetrius
thinks
not
so
He
will
not
know
what
all
but
he
do
know
And
as
he
errs
doting
on
Hermias
eyes
So
I
admiring
of
his
qualities
Things
base
and
vile
holding
no
quantity
Love
can
transpose
to
form
and
dignity
Love
looks
not
with
the
eyes
but
with
the
mind
And
therefore
is
wingd
Cupid
painted
blind
Nor
hath
Loves
mind
of
any
judgment
taste
Wings
and
no
eyes
figure
unheedy
haste
And
therefore
is
Love
said
to
be
a
child
Because
in
choice
he
is
so
oft
beguild
As
waggish
boys
in
game
themselves
forswear
So
the
boy
Love
is
perjurd
everywhere
For
ere
Demetrius
lookd
on
Hermias
eyne
He
haild
down
oaths
that
he
was
only
mine
And
when
this
hail
some
heat
from
Hermia
felt
So
he
dissolvd
and
showrs
of
oaths
did
melt
I
will
go
tell
him
of
fair
Hermias
flight
Then
to
the
wood
will
he
tomorrow
night
Pursue
her
and
for
this
intelligence
If
I
have
thanks
it
is
a
dear
expense
But
herein
mean
I
to
enrich
my
pain
To
have
his
sight
thither
and
back
again
Come
now
a
roundel
and
a
fairy
song
Then
for
the
third
part
of
a
minute
hence
Some
to
kill
cankers
in
the
muskrose
buds
Some
war
with
reremice
for
their
leathern
wings
To
make
my
small
elves
coats
and
some
keep
back
The
clamorous
owl
that
nightly
hoots
and
wonders
At
our
quaint
spirits
Sing
me
now
asleep
Then
to
your
offices
and
let
me
rest
The
Sing
You
spotted
snakes
with
double
tongue
Thorny
hedgehogs
be
not
seen
Newts
and
blindworms
do
no
wrong
Come
not
near
our
fairy
Queen
Philomel
with
melody
Sing
in
our
sweet
lullaby
Lulla
lulla
lullaby
lulla
lulla
lullaby
Never
harm
Nor
spell
nor
charm
Come
our
lovely
lady
nigh
So
good
night
with
lullaby
Weaving
spiders
come
not
here
Hence
you
longleggd
spinners
hence
Beetles
black
approach
not
near
Worm
nor
snail
do
no
offence
Philomel
with
melody
etc
Sleeps
Hence
away
now
all
is
well
One
aloof
stand
sentinel
Enter
and
squeezes
the
flower
on
eyelids
What
thou
seest
when
thou
dost
wake
Do
it
for
thy
truelove
take
Love
and
languish
for
his
sake
Be
it
ounce
or
cat
or
bear
Pard
or
boar
with
bristled
hair
In
thy
eye
that
shall
appear
When
thou
wakst
it
is
thy
dear
Wake
when
some
vile
thing
is
near
Enter
and
Fair
love
you
faint
with
wandring
in
the
wood
And
to
speak
troth
I
have
forgot
our
way
Well
rest
us
Hermia
if
you
think
it
good
And
tarry
for
the
comfort
of
the
day
Be
it
so
Lysander
find
you
out
a
bed
For
I
upon
this
bank
will
rest
my
head
One
turf
shall
serve
as
pillow
for
us
both
One
heart
one
bed
two
bosoms
and
one
troth
Nay
good
Lysander
for
my
sake
my
dear
Lie
further
off
yet
do
not
lie
so
near
take
the
sense
sweet
of
my
innocence
Love
takes
the
meaning
in
loves
conference
I
mean
that
my
heart
unto
yours
is
knit
So
that
but
one
heart
we
can
make
of
it
Two
bosoms
interchained
with
an
oath
So
then
two
bosoms
and
a
single
troth
Then
by
your
side
no
bedroom
me
deny
For
lying
so
Hermia
I
do
not
lie
Lysander
riddles
very
prettily
Now
much
beshrew
my
manners
and
my
pride
If
Hermia
meant
to
say
Lysander
lied
But
gentle
friend
for
love
and
courtesy
Lie
further
off
in
human
modesty
Such
separation
as
may
well
be
said
Becomes
a
virtuous
bachelor
and
a
maid
So
far
be
distant
and
good
night
sweet
friend
Thy
love
neer
alter
till
thy
sweet
life
end
Amen
amen
to
that
fair
prayer
say
I
And
then
end
life
when
I
end
loyalty
Here
is
my
bed
sleep
give
thee
all
his
rest
With
half
that
wish
the
wishers
eyes
be
pressd
They
sleep
Enter
Through
the
forest
have
I
gone
But
Athenian
found
I
none
On
whose
eyes
I
might
approve
This
flowers
force
in
stirring
love
Night
and
silence
Who
is
here
Weeds
of
Athens
he
doth
wear
This
is
he
my
master
said
Despised
the
Athenian
maid
And
here
the
maiden
sleeping
sound
On
the
dank
and
dirty
ground
Pretty
soul
she
durst
not
lie
Near
this
lacklove
this
killcourtesy
Churl
upon
thy
eyes
I
throw
All
the
power
this
charm
doth
owe
When
thou
wakst
let
love
forbid
Sleep
his
seat
on
thy
eyelid
So
awake
when
I
am
gone
For
I
must
now
to
Oberon
Enter
and
running
Stay
though
thou
kill
me
sweet
Demetrius
I
charge
thee
hence
and
do
not
haunt
me
thus
wilt
thou
darkling
leave
me
Do
not
so
Stay
on
thy
peril
I
alone
will
go
I
am
out
of
breath
in
this
fond
chase
The
more
my
prayer
the
lesser
is
my
grace
Happy
is
Hermia
wheresoeer
she
lies
For
she
hath
blessed
and
attractive
eyes
How
came
her
eyes
so
bright
Not
with
salt
tears
If
so
my
eyes
are
oftner
washd
than
hers
No
no
I
am
as
ugly
as
a
bear
For
beasts
that
meet
me
run
away
for
fear
Therefore
no
marvel
though
Demetrius
Do
as
a
monster
fly
my
presence
thus
What
wicked
and
dissembling
glass
of
mine
Made
me
compare
with
Hermias
sphery
eyne
But
who
is
here
Lysander
on
the
ground
Dead
or
asleep
I
see
no
blood
no
wound
Lysander
if
you
live
good
sir
awake
Waking
And
run
through
fire
I
will
for
thy
sweet
sake
Transparent
Helena
Nature
shows
art
That
through
thy
bosom
makes
me
see
thy
heart
Where
is
Demetrius
how
fit
a
word
Is
that
vile
name
to
perish
on
my
sword
Do
not
say
so
Lysander
say
not
so
What
though
he
love
your
Hermia
Lord
what
though
Yet
Hermia
still
loves
you
then
be
content
Content
with
Hermia
No
I
do
repent
The
tedious
minutes
I
with
her
have
spent
Not
Hermia
but
Helena
I
love
Who
will
not
change
a
raven
for
a
dove
The
will
of
man
is
by
his
reason
swayd
And
reason
says
you
are
the
worthier
maid
Things
growing
are
not
ripe
until
their
season
So
I
being
young
till
now
ripe
not
to
reason
And
touching
now
the
point
of
human
skill
Reason
becomes
the
marshal
to
my
will
And
leads
me
to
your
eyes
where
I
oerlook
Loves
stories
written
in
Loves
richest
book
Wherefore
was
I
to
this
keen
mockery
born
When
at
your
hands
did
I
deserve
this
scorn
Ist
not
enough
ist
not
enough
young
man
That
I
did
never
no
nor
never
can
Deserve
a
sweet
look
from
Demetrius
eye
But
you
must
flout
my
insufficiency
Good
troth
you
do
me
wrong
good
sooth
you
do
In
such
disdainful
manner
me
to
woo
But
fare
you
well
perforce
I
must
confess
I
thought
you
lord
of
more
true
gentleness
that
a
lady
of
one
man
refusd
Should
of
another
therefore
be
abusd
She
sees
not
Hermia
Hermia
sleep
thou
there
And
never
mayst
thou
come
Lysander
near
For
as
a
surfeit
of
the
sweetest
things
The
deepest
loathing
to
the
stomach
brings
Or
as
the
heresies
that
men
do
leave
Are
hated
most
of
those
they
did
deceive
So
thou
my
surfeit
and
my
heresy
Of
all
be
hated
but
the
most
of
me
And
all
my
powers
address
your
love
and
might
To
honour
Helen
and
to
be
her
knight
Starting
Help
me
Lysander
help
me
do
thy
best
To
pluck
this
crawling
serpent
from
my
breast
Ay
me
for
pity
What
a
dream
was
here
Lysander
look
how
I
do
quake
with
fear
Methought
a
serpent
eat
my
heart
away
And
you
sat
smiling
at
his
cruel
prey
Lysander
What
removd
Lysander
lord
What
out
of
hearing
gone
No
sound
no
word
Alack
where
are
you
Speak
an
if
you
hear
Speak
of
all
loves
I
swoon
almost
with
fear
No
Then
I
well
perceive
you
are
not
nigh
Either
death
or
you
Ill
find
immediately
I
The
wood
lying
asleep
Enter
and
Are
we
all
met
Pat
pat
and
heres
a
marvellous
convenient
place
for
our
rehearsal
This
green
plot
shall
be
our
stage
this
hawthorn
brake
our
tiringhouse
and
we
will
do
it
in
action
as
we
will
do
it
before
the
Duke
Peter
Quince
What
sayest
thou
bully
Bottom
There
are
things
in
this
comedy
of
Pyramus
and
Thisby
that
will
never
please
First
Pyramus
must
draw
a
sword
to
kill
himself
which
the
ladies
cannot
abide
How
answer
you
that
Byr
lakin
a
parlous
fear
I
believe
we
must
leave
the
killing
out
when
all
is
done
Not
a
whit
I
have
a
device
to
make
all
well
Write
me
a
prologue
and
let
the
prologue
seem
to
say
we
will
do
no
harm
with
our
swords
and
that
Pyramus
is
not
killd
indeed
and
for
the
more
better
assurance
tell
them
that
I
Pyramus
am
not
Pyramus
but
Bottom
the
weaver
This
will
put
them
out
of
fear
Well
we
will
have
such
a
prologue
and
it
shall
be
written
in
eight
and
six
No
make
it
two
more
let
it
be
written
in
eight
and
eight
Will
not
the
ladies
be
afeard
of
the
lion
I
fear
it
I
promise
you
Masters
you
ought
to
consider
with
yourself
to
bring
in
God
shield
us
a
lion
among
ladies
is
a
most
dreadful
thing
for
there
is
not
a
more
fearful
wildfowl
than
your
lion
living
and
we
ought
to
look
tot
Therefore
another
prologue
must
tell
he
is
not
a
lion
Nay
you
must
name
his
name
and
half
his
face
must
be
seen
through
the
lions
neck
and
he
himself
must
speak
through
saying
thus
or
to
the
same
defect
Ladies
or
Fair
ladies
I
would
wish
you
or
I
would
request
you
or
I
would
entreat
you
not
to
fear
not
to
tremble
My
life
for
yours
If
you
think
I
come
hither
as
a
lion
it
were
pity
of
my
life
No
I
am
no
such
thing
I
am
a
man
as
other
men
are
And
there
indeed
let
him
name
his
name
and
tell
them
plainly
he
is
Snug
the
joiner
Well
it
shall
be
so
But
there
is
two
hard
things
that
is
to
bring
the
moonlight
into
a
chamber
for
you
know
Pyramus
and
Thisby
meet
by
moonlight
Doth
the
moon
shine
that
night
we
play
our
play
calendar
a
calendar
Look
in
the
almanack
find
out
moonshine
find
out
moonshine
Yes
it
doth
shine
that
night
Why
then
may
you
leave
a
casement
of
the
great
chamber
window
where
we
play
open
and
the
moon
may
shine
in
at
the
casement
Ay
or
else
one
must
come
in
with
a
bush
of
thorns
and
a
lantern
and
say
he
comes
to
disfigure
or
to
present
the
person
of
Moonshine
Then
there
is
another
thing
we
must
have
a
wall
in
the
great
chamber
for
Pyramus
and
Thisby
says
the
story
did
talk
through
the
chink
of
a
wall
You
can
never
bring
in
a
wall
What
say
you
Bottom
Some
man
or
other
must
present
Wall
and
let
him
have
some
plaster
or
some
loam
or
some
roughcast
about
him
to
signify
wall
and
let
him
hold
his
fingers
thus
and
through
that
cranny
shall
Pyramus
and
Thisby
whisper
If
that
may
be
then
all
is
well
Come
sit
down
every
mothers
son
and
rehearse
your
parts
Pyramus
you
begin
when
you
have
spoken
your
speech
enter
into
that
brake
and
so
every
one
according
to
his
cue
Enter
behind
What
hempen
homespuns
have
we
swaggring
here
So
near
the
cradle
of
the
Fairy
Queen
What
a
play
toward
Ill
be
an
auditor
An
actor
too
perhaps
if
I
see
cause
Speak
Pyramus
Thisby
stand
forth
Thisby
the
flowers
of
odious
savours
sweet
Odious
odorous
odours
savours
sweet
So
hath
thy
breath
my
dearest
Thisby
dear
But
hark
a
voice
Stay
thou
but
here
awhile
And
by
and
by
I
will
to
thee
appear
stranger
Pyramus
than
eer
played
here
Must
I
speak
now
Ay
marry
must
you
for
you
must
understand
he
goes
but
to
see
a
noise
that
he
heard
and
is
to
come
again
Most
radiant
Pyramus
most
lilywhite
of
hue
Of
colour
like
the
red
rose
on
triumphant
brier
Most
brisky
juvenal
and
eke
most
lovely
Jew
As
true
as
truest
horse
that
would
never
tire
Ill
meet
thee
Pyramus
at
Ninnys
tomb
Ninus
tomb
man
Why
you
must
not
speak
that
yet
that
you
answer
to
Pyramus
You
speak
all
your
part
at
once
cues
and
all
Pyramus
enter
your
cue
is
past
it
is
never
tire
As
true
as
truest
horse
that
y
et
would
never
tire
Reenter
and
with
an
asss
head
If
I
were
fair
Thisby
I
were
only
thine
monstrous
strange
We
are
haunted
Pray
masters
fly
masters
Help
Ill
follow
you
Ill
lead
you
about
a
round
Through
bog
through
bush
through
brake
through
brier
Sometime
a
horse
Ill
be
sometime
a
hound
hog
a
headless
bear
sometime
a
fire
And
neigh
and
bark
and
grunt
and
roar
and
burn
Like
horse
hound
hog
bear
fire
at
every
turn
Why
do
they
run
away
This
is
a
knavery
of
them
to
make
me
afeard
Reenter
Bottom

art
changd
What

I
see
on
thee
What

You

Reenter
Bless

Thou

their
knavery
this
is
to
make
an
ass
of
me
to
fright
me
if
they
could
But
I
will
not
stir
from
this
place
do
what
they
can
I
will
walk
up
and
down
here
and
will
sing
that
they
shall
hear
I
am
not
afraid
Sings
The
ousel
cock
so
black
of
hue
With
orangetawny
bill
The
throstle
with
his
note
so
true
The
wren
with
little
quill
What
angel
wakes
me
from
my
flowry
bed
Sings
The
finch
the
sparrow
and
the
lark
The
plainsong
cuckoo
grey
Whose
note
full
many
a
man
doth
mark
And
dares
not
answer
nay
for
indeed
who
would
set
his
wit
to
so
foolish
a
bird
Who
would
give
a
bird
the
he
though
he
cry
cuckoo
never
so
I
pray
thee
gentle
mortal
sing
again
Mine
ear
is
much
enamoured
of
thy
note
So
is
mine
eye
enthralled
to
thy
shape
And
thy
fair
virtues
force
perforce
doth
move
me
On
the
first
view
to
say
to
swear
I
love
thee
Methinks
mistress
you
should
have
little
reason
for
that
And
yet
to
say
the
truth
reason
and
love
keep
little
company
together
nowadays
The
more
the
pity
that
some
honest
neighbours
will
not
make
them
friends
Nay
I
can
gleek
upon
occasion
Thou
art
as
wise
as
thou
art
beautiful
Not
so
neither
but
if
I
had
wit
enough
to
get
out
of
this
wood
I
have
enough
to
serve
mine
own
turn
Out
of
this
wood
do
not
desire
to
go
Thou
shalt
remain
here
whether
thou
wilt
or
no
I
am
a
spirit
of
no
common
rate
The
summer
still
doth
tend
upon
my
state
And
I
do
love
thee
therefore
go
with
me
Ill
give
thee
fairies
to
attend
on
thee
And
they
shall
fetch
thee
jewels
from
the
deep
And
sing
while
thou
on
pressed
flowers
dost
sleep
And
I
will
purge
thy
mortal
grossness
so
That
thou
shalt
like
an
airy
spirit
go
Peaseblossom
Cobweb
Moth
and
Mustardseed
Enter
and
Ready
And
I
And
I
And
I
Where
shall
we
go
Be
kind
and
courteous
to
this
gentleman
Hop
in
his
walks
and
gambol
in
his
eyes
Feed
him
with
apricocks
and
dewberries
With
purple
grapes
green
figs
and
mulberries
The
honey
bags
steal
from
the
humblebees
And
for
nighttapers
crop
their
waxen
thighs
And
light
them
at
the
fiery
glowworms
eyes
To
have
my
love
to
bed
and
to
arise
And
pluck
the
wings
from
painted
butterflies
To
fan
the
moonbeams
from
his
sleeping
eyes
Nod
to
him
elves
and
do
him
courtesies
Hail
mortal
Hail
Hail
Hail
I
cry
your
worships
mercy
heartily
I
beseech
your
worships
name
Cobweb
I
shall
desire
you
of
more
acquaintance
good
Master
Cobweb
If
I
cut
my
finger
I
shall
make
bold
with
you
Your
name
honest
gentleman
Peaseblossom
I
pray
you
commend
me
to
Mistress
Squash
your
mother
and
to
Master
Peascod
your
father
Good
Master
Peaseblossom
I
shall
desire
you
of
more
acquaintance
too
Your
name
I
beseech
you
sir
Mustardseed
Good
Master
Mustardseed
I
know
your
patience
well
That
same
cowardly
giantlike
oxbeef
hath
devourd
many
a
gentleman
of
your
house
I
promise
you
your
kindred
hath
made
my
eyes
water
ere
now
I
desire
you
of
more
acquaintance
good
Master
Mustardseed
Come
wait
upon
him
lead
him
to
my
bower
The
moon
methinks
looks
with
a
watry
eye
And
when
she
weeps
weeps
every
little
flower
Lamenting
some
enforced
chastity
Tie
up
my
loves
tongue
bring
him
silently
Have
you
sent
to
Bottoms
house
Is
he
come
home
yet
He
cannot
be
heard
of
Out
of
doubt
he
is
transported
If
he
come
not
then
the
play
is
marrd
it
goes
not
forward
doth
it
It
is
not
possible
You
have
not
a
man
in
all
Athens
able
to
discharge
Pyramus
but
he
No
he
hath
simply
the
best
wit
of
any
handicraft
man
in
Athens
Yea
and
the
best
person
too
and
he
is
a
very
paramour
for
a
sweet
voice
You
must
say
paragon
paramour
is
God
bless
us
thing
of
naught
Enter
Masters
the
Duke
is
coming
from
the
temple
and
there
is
two
or
three
lords
and
ladies
more
married
If
our

had
gone
forward
we
had

been
made

Thus
hath
he
lost
sixpence
a
day
during
his
life
he
could
not

scaped

An
the
Duke
had
not
given
him
sixpence
a

for
playing

Ill
be

He
would
have
deserved
it
sixpence
a

in

or
nothing
Enter
Where
are
these

Where
are
these
hearts
Bottom
most
courageous
day
most
happy
hour
Masters
I
am
to
discourse
wonders
but
ask
me
not
what
for
if
I
tell
you
I
am
not
true
Athenian
I
will
tell
you
everything
right
as
it
fell
out
Let
us
hear
sweet
Bottom
Not
a
word
of
me
All
that
I
will
tell
you
is
that
the
Duke
hath
dined
Get
your
apparel
together
good
strings
to
your
beards
new
ribbons
to
your
pumps
meet
presently
at
the
palace
every
man
look
oer
his
part
for
the
short
and
the
long
is
our
play
is
preferrd
In
any
case
let
Thisby
have
clean
linen
and
let
not
him
that
plays
the
lion
pare
his
nails
for
they
shall
hang
out
for
the
lions
claws
And
most
dear
actors
eat
no
onions
nor
garlic
for
we
are
to
utter
sweet
breath
and
I
do
not
doubt
but
to
hear
them
say
it
is
a
sweet
comedy
No
more
words
Away
go
away
I
Athens
The
palace
of
Enter
and
Tis
strange
my
Theseus
that
these
lovers
speak
of
More
strange
than
true
I
never
may
believe
These
antique
fables
nor
these
fairy
toys
Lovers
and
madmen
have
such
seething
brains
Such
shaping
fantasies
that
apprehend
More
than
cool
reason
ever
comprehends
The
lunatic
the
lover
and
the
poet
Are
of
imagination
all
compact
One
sees
more
devils
than
vast
hell
can
hold
That
is
the
madman
The
lover
all
as
frantic
Sees
Helens
beauty
in
a
brow
of
Egypt
The
poets
eye
in
a
fine
frenzy
rolling
Doth
glance
from
heaven
to
earth
from
earth
to
heaven
And
as
imagination
bodies
forth
The
forms
of
things
unknown
the
poets
pen
Turns
them
to
shapes
and
gives
to
airy
nothing
local
habitation
and
a
name
Such
tricks
hath
strong
imagination
That
if
it
would
but
apprehend
some
joy
It
comprehends
some
bringer
of
that
joy
Or
in
the
night
imagining
some
fear
How
easy
is
a
bush
supposd
a
bear
But
all
the
story
of
the
night
told
over
And
all
their
minds
transfigurd
so
together
More
witnesseth
than
fancys
images
And
grows
to
something
of
great
constancy
But
howsoever
strange
and
admirable
Enter
and
Here
come
the
lovers
full
of
joy
and
mirth
Joy
gentle
friends
joy
and
fresh
days
of
love
Accompany
your
hearts
More
than
to
us
Wait
in
your
royal
walks
your
board
your
bed
Come
now
what
masques
what
dances
shall
we
have
To
wear
away
this
long
age
of
three
hours
Between
our
aftersupper
and
bedtime
Where
is
our
usual
manager
of
mirth
What
revels
are
in
hand
Is
there
no
play
To
ease
the
anguish
of
a
torturing
hour
Call
Philostrate
Here
mighty
Theseus
Say
what
abridgment
have
you
for
this
evening
What
masque
what
music
How
shall
we
beguile
The
lazy
time
if
not
with
some
delight
There
is
a
brief
how
many
sports
are
ripe
Make
choice
of
which
your
Highness
will
see
first
Giving
a
paper
The
battle
with
the
Centaurs
to
be
sung
By
an
Athenian
eunuch
to
the
harp
Well
none
of
that
that
have
I
told
my
love
In
glory
of
my
kinsman
Hercules
The
riot
of
the
tipsy
Bacchanals
Tearing
the
Thracian
singer
in
their
rage
That
is
an
old
device
and
it
was
playd
When
I
from
Thebes
came
last
a
conqueror
The
thrice
three
Muses
mourning
for
the
death
Of
Learning
late
deceasd
in
beggary
That
is
some
satire
keen
and
critical
Not
sorting
with
a
nuptial
ceremony
tedious
brief
scene
of
young
Pyramus
And
his
love
Thisby
very
tragical
mirth
Merry
and
tragical
tedious
and
brief
That
is
hot
ice
and
wondrous
strange
snow
How
shall
we
find
the
concord
of
this
discord
play
there
is
my
lord
some
ten
words
long
Which
is
as
brief
as
I
have
known
a
play
But
by
ten
words
my
lord
it
is
too
long
Which
makes
it
tedious
for
in
all
the
play
There
is
not
one
word
apt
one
player
fitted
And
tragical
my
noble
lord
it
is
For
Pyramus
therein
doth
kill
himself
Which
when
I
saw
rehearsd
I
must
confess
Made
mine
eyes
water
but
more
merry
tears
The
passion
of
loud
laughter
never
shed
What
are
they
that
do
play
it
Hardhanded
men
that
work
in
Athens
here
Which
never
labourd
in
their
minds
till
now
And
now
have
toild
their
unbreathed
memories
With
this
same
play
against
your
nuptial
And
we
will
hear
it
No
my
noble
lord
It
is
not
for
you
I
have
heard
it
over
And
it
is
nothing
nothing
in
the
world
Unless
you
can
find
sport
in
their
intents
Extremely
stretchd
and
connd
with
cruel
pain
To
do
you
service
I
will
hear
that
play
For
never
anything
can
be
amiss
When
simpleness
and
duty
tender
it
Go
bring
them
in
and
take
your
places
ladies
I
love
not
to
see
wretchedness
oercharged
And
duty
in
his
service
perishing
Why
gentle
sweet
you
shall
see
no
such
thing
He
says
they
can
do
nothing
in
this
kind
The
kinder
we
to
give
them
thanks
for
nothing
Our
sport
shall
be
to
take
what
they
mistake
And
what
poor
duty
cannot
do
noble
respect
Takes
it
in
might
not
merit
Where
I
have
come
great
clerks
have
purposed
To
greet
me
with
premeditated
welcomes
Where
I
have
seen
them
shiver
and
look
pale
Make
periods
in
the
midst
of
sentences
Throttle
their
practisd
accent
in
their
fears
And
in
conclusion
dumbly
have
broke
off
Not
paying
me
a
welcome
Trust
me
sweet
Out
of
this
silence
yet
I
pickd
a
welcome
And
in
the
modesty
of
fearful
duty
I
read
as
much
as
from
the
rattling
tongue
Of
saucy
and
audacious
eloquence
Love
therefore
and
tonguetied
simplicity
In
least
speak
most
to
my
capacity
Reenter
please
your
Grace
the
Prologue
is
addressd
Let
him
approach
Flourish
of
trumpets
Enter
as
the
If
we
offend
it
is
with
our
good
will
That
you
should
think
we
come
not
to
offend
But
with
good
will
To
show
our
simple
skill
That
is
the
true
beginning
of
our
end
Consider
then
we
come
but
in
despite
We
do
not
come
as
minding
to
content
you
Our
true
intent
is
All
for
your
delight
We
are
not
here
That
you
should
here
repent
you
The
actors
are
at
band
and
by
their
show
You
shall
know
all
that
you
are
like
to
know
This
fellow
doth
not
stand
upon
points
He
hath
rid
his
prologue
like
a
rough
colt
he
knows
not
the
stop
good
moral
my
lord
it
is
not
enough
to
speak
but
to
speak
true
Indeed
he
hath
playd
on
this
prologue
like
a
child
on
a
recorder
a
sound
but
not
in
government
His
speech
was
like
a
tangled
chain
nothing
im
paired
but
all
disordered
Who
is
next
Enter
with
a
trumpet
before
them
as
in
dumb
show
and
and
Gentles
perchance
you
wonder
at
this
show
But
wonder
on
till
truth
make
all
things
plain
This
man
is
Pyramus
if
you
would
know
This
beauteous
lady
Thisby
is
certain
This
man
with
lime
and
roughcast
doth
present
Wall
that
vile
Wall
which
did
these
lovers
sunder
And
through
Walls
chink
poor
souls
they
are
content
To
whisper
At
the
which
let
no
man
wonder
This
man
with
lanthorn
dog
and
bush
of
thorn
Presenteth
Moonshine
for
if
you
will
know
By
moonshine
did
these
lovers
think
no
scorn
To
meet
at
Ninus
tomb
there
there
to
woo
This
grisly
beast
which
Lion
hight
by
name
The
trusty
Thisby
coming
first
by
night
Did
scare
away
or
rather
did
affright
And
as
she
fled
her
mantle
she
did
fall
Which
Lion
vile
with
bloody
mouth
did
stain
Anon
comes
Pyramus
sweet
youth
and
tall
And
finds
his
trusty
Thisbys
mantle
slain
Whereat
with
blade
with
bloody
blameful
blade
He
bravely
broachd
his
boiling
bloody
breast
And
Thisby
tarrying
in
mulberry
shade
His
dagger
drew
and
died
For
all
the
rest
Let
Lion
Moonshine
Wall
and
lovers
twain
At
large
discourse
while
here
they
do
remain
and
I
wonder
if
the
lion
be
to
speak
No
wonder
my
lord
one
lion
may
when
many
asses
do
In
this
same
interlude
it
doth
befall
That
I
one
Snout
by
name
present
a
wall
And
such
a
wall
as
I
would
have
you
think
That
had
in
it
a
crannied
hole
or
chink
Through
which
the
lovers
Pyramus
and
Thisby
Did
whisper
often
very
secretly
This
loam
this
roughcast
and
this
stone
doth
show
That
I
am
that
same
wall
the
truth
is
so
And
this
the
cranny
is
right
and
sinister
Through
which
the
fearful
lovers
are
to
whisper
Would
you
desire
lime
and
hair
to
speak
better
It
is
the
wittiest
partition
that
ever
I
heard
discourse
my
lord
Enter
Pyramus
draws
near
the
wall
silence
grimlookd
night
night
with
hue
so
black
night
which
ever
art
when
day
is
not
night
night
alack
alack
alack
I
fear
my
Thisbys
promise
is
forgot
And
thou
wall
sweet
lovely
wall
That
standst
between
her
fathers
ground
and
mine
Thou
wall
wall
sweet
and
lovely
wall
Show
me
thy
chink
to
blink
through
with
mine
eyne
holds
up
his
fingers
Thanks
courteous
wall
Jove
shield
thee
well
for
this
But
what
see
what
see
I
No
Thisby
do
I
see
wicked
wall
through
whom
I
see
no
bliss
Cursd
he
thy
stones
for
thus
deceiving
me
The
wall
methinks
being
sensible
should
curse
again
No
in
truth
sir
he
should
not
Deceiving
me
is
Thisbys
cue
She
is
to
enter
now
and
I
am
to
spy
her
through
the
wall
You
shall
see
it
will
fall
pat
as
I
told
you
yonder
she
comes
Enter
wall
full
often
hast
thou
beard
my
moans
For
parting
my
fair
Pyramus
and
me
My
cherry
lips
have
often
kissd
thy
stones
Thy
stones
with
lime
and
hair
knit
up
in
thee
I
see
a
voice
now
will
I
to
the
chink
To
spy
an
I
can
hear
my
Thisbys
face
Thisby
My
love
thou
art
my
love
I
think
Think
what
thou
wilt
I
am
thy
lovers
grace
And
like
Limander
am
I
trusty
still
And
I
like
Helen
till
the
Fates
me
kill
Not
Shafalus
to
Procrus
was
so
true
As
Shafalus
to
Procrus
I
to
you
kiss
me
through
the
hole
of
this
vile
wall
I
kiss
the
walls
hole
not
your
lips
at
all
Wilt
thou
at
Ninnys
tomb
meet
me
straightway
Tide
life
tide
death
I
come
without
delay
Thus
have
I
Wall
my
part
discharged
so
And
being
done
thus
Wall
away
doth
go
Now
is
the
moon
used
between
the
two
neighbours
No
remedy
my
lord
when
walls
are
so
wilful
to
hear
without
warning
This
is
the
silliest
stuff
that
ever
I
heard
The
best
in
this
kind
are
but
shadows
and
the
worst
are
no
worse
if
imagination
amend
them
It
must
be
your
imagination
then
and
not
theirs
If
we
imagine
no
worse
of
them
than
they
of
themselves
they
may
pass
for
excellent
men
Here
come
two
noble
beasts
in
a
man
and
a
lion
Enter
and
You
ladies
you
whose
gentle
hearts
do
fear
The
smallest
monstrous
mouse
that
creeps
on
floor
May
now
perchance
both
quake
and
tremble
here
When
lion
rough
in
wildest
rage
doth
roar
Then
know
that
I
as
Snug
the
joiner
am
lion
fell
nor
else
no
lions
dam
For
if
I
should
as
lion
come
in
strife
Into
this
place
twere
pity
on
my
life
very
gentle
beast
and
of
a
good
conscience
The
very
best
at
a
beast
my
lord
that
eer
I
saw
This
lion
is
a
very
fox
for
his
valour
True
and
a
goose
for
his
discretion
Not
so
my
lord
for
his
valour
cannot
carry
his
discretion
and
the
fox
carries
the
goose
His
discretion
I
am
sure
cannot
carry
his
valour
for
the
goose
carries
not
the
fox
It
is
well
Leave
it
to
his
discretion
and
let
us
listen
to
the
Moon
This
lanthorn
doth
the
horned
moon
present
He
should
have
worn
the
horns
on
his
head
He
is
no
crescent
and
his
horns
are
invisible
within
the
circumference
This
lanthorn
doth
the
horned
moon
present
Myself
the
Man
i
th
Moon
do
seem
to
be
This
is
the
greatest
error
of
all
the
rest
the
man
should
be
put
into
the
lantern
How
is
it
else
the
man
i
th
moon
He
dares
not
come
there
for
the
candle
for
you
see
it
is
already
in
snuff
I
am
aweary
of
this
moon
Would
he
would
change
It
appears
by
his
small
light
of
discretion
that
he
is
in
the
wane
but
yet
in
courtesy
in
all
reason
we
must
stay
the
time
Proceed
Moon
All
that
I
have
to
say
is
to
tell
you
that
the
lanthorn
is
the
moon
I
the
Man
i
th
Moon
this
thornbush
my
thornbush
and
this
dog
my
dog
Why
all
these
should
be
in
the
lantern
for
all
these
are
in
the
moon
But
silence
here
comes
Thisby
Reenter
This
is
old
Ninnys
tomb
Where
is
my
love
Roaring
runs
off
Well
roard
Lion
Well
run
Thisby
Well
shone
Moon
Truly
the
moon
shines
with
a
good
grace
The
tears
Mantle
and
exit
Well
mousd
Lion
Reenter
And
then
came
Pyramus
And
so
the
lion
vanishd
Sweet
Moon
I
thank
thee
for
thy
sunny
beams
I
thank
thee
Moon
for
shining
now
so
bright
For
by
thy
gracious
golden
glittering
gleams
I
trust
to
take
of
truest
Thisby
sight
But
stay
spite
But
mark
poor
knight
What
dreadful
dole
is
here
Eyes
do
you
see
How
can
it
he
dainty
duck
dear
Thy
mantle
good
What
staind
with
blood
Approach
ye
Furies
fell
Fates
come
come
Cut
thread
and
thrum
Quail
crush
conclude
and
quell
This
passion
and
the
death
of
a
dear
friend
would
go
near
to
make
a
man
look
sad
Beshrew
my
heart
but
I
pity
the
man
wherefore
Nature
didst
thou
lions
frame
Since
lion
vile
hath
here
deflowerd
my
dear
Which
is
no
no
which
was
the
fairest
dame
That
livd
that
lovd
that
likd
that
lookd
with
cheer
Come
tears
confound
Out
sword
and
wound
The
pap
of
Pyramus
Ay
that
left
pap
Where
heart
doth
hop
Stabs
himself
Thus
die
I
thus
thus
thus
Now
am
I
dead
Now
am
I
fled
My
soul
is
in
the
sky
Tongue
lose
thy
light
Moon
take
thy
flight
Now
die
die
die
die
die
Dies
No
die
but
an
ace
for
him
for
he
is
but
one
Less
than
an
ace
man
for
he
is
dead
he
is
nothing
With
the
help
of
a
surgeon
he
might
yet
recover
and
yet
prove
an
ass
How
chance
Moonshine
is
gone
before
Thisby
comes
back
and
finds
her
lover
Reenter
She
will
find
him
by
starlight
Here
she
comes
and
her
passion
ends
the
play
Methinks
she
should
not
use
a
long
one
for
such
a
Pyramus
I
hope
she
will
be
brief
mote
will
turn
the
balance
which
Pyramus
which
Thisby
is
the
better
he
for
a
man
God
warrant
us
She
for
a
woman
God
bless
us
She
hath
spied
him
already
with
those
sweet
eyes
And
thus
she
moans
videlicet
Asleep
my
love
What
dead
my
dove
Pyramus
arise
Speak
speak
Quite
dumb
Dead
dead
tomb
Must
cover
thy
sweet
eyes
These
lily
lips
This
cherry
nose
These
yellow
cowslip
cheeks
Are
gone
are
gone
Lovers
make
moan
His
eyes
were
green
as
leeks
Sisters
Three
Come
come
to
me
With
hands
as
pale
as
milk
Lay
them
in
gore
Since
you
have
shore
With
shears
his
thread
of
silk
Tongue
not
a
word
Come
trusty
sword
Come
blade
my
breast
imbrue
Stabs
herself
And
farewell
friends
Thus
Thisby
ends
Adieu
adieu
adieu
Dies
Moonshine
and
Lion
are
left
to
bury
the
dead
Ay
and
Wall
too
Starting
up
No
I
assure
you
the
wall
is
down
that
parted
their
fathers
Will
it
please
you
to
see
the
Epilogue
or
to
hear
a
Bergomask
dance
between
two
of
our
company
No
epilogue
I
pray
you
for
your
play
needs
no
excuse
Never
excuse
for
when
the
players
are
all
dead
there
need
none
to
be
blamed
Marry
if
he
that
writ
it
had
played
Pyramus
and
hangd
himself
in
Thisbys
garter
it
would
have
been
a
fine
tragedy
And
so
it
is
truly
and
very
notably
dischargd
But
come
your
Bergomask
let
your
epilogue
alone
dance
The
iron
tongue
of
midnight
hath
told
twelve
Lovers
to
bed
tis
almost
fairy
time
I
fear
we
shall
outsleep
the
coming
morn
As
much
as
we
this
night
have
overwatchd
This
palpablegross
play
hath
well
beguild
The
heavy
gait
of
night
Sweet
friends
to
bed
fortnight
hold
we
this
solemnity
In
nightly
revels
and
new
jollity
Enter
with
a
broom
Now
the
hungry
lion
roars
And
the
wolf
behowls
the
moon
Whilst
the
heavy
ploughman
snores
All
with
weary
task
fordone
Now
the
wasted
brands
do
glow
Whilst
the
screechowl
screeching
loud
Puts
the
wretch
that
lies
in
woe
In
remembrance
of
a
shroud
Now
it
is
the
time
of
night
That
the
graves
all
gaping
wide
Every
one
lets
forth
his
sprite
In
the
churchway
paths
to
glide
And
we
fairies
that
do
run
By
the
triple
Hecates
team
From
the
presence
of
the
sun
Following
darkness
like
a
dream
Now
are
frolic
Not
a
mouse
Shall
disturb
this
hallowed
house
I
am
sent
with
broom
before
To
sweep
the
dust
behind
the
door
Enter
and
with
all
their
train
Through
the
house
give
glimmering
light
By
the
dead
and
drowsy
fire
Every
elf
and
fairy
sprite
Hop
as
light
as
bird
from
brier
And
this
ditty
after
me
Sing
and
dance
it
trippingly
First
rehearse
your
song
by
rote
To
each
word
a
warbling
note
Hand
in
hand
with
fairy
grace
Will
we
sing
and
bless
this
place
leading
the
sing
and
dance
Now
until
the
break
of
day
Through
this
house
each
fairy
stray
To
the
best
bridebed
will
we
Which
by
us
shall
blessed
be
And
the
issue
there
create
Ever
shall
be
fortunate
So
shall
all
the
couples
three
Ever
true
in
loving
be
And
the
blots
of
Natures
hand
Shall
not
in
their
issue
stand
Never
mole
harelip
nor
scar
Nor
mark
prodigious
such
as
are
Despised
in
nativity
Shall
upon
their
children
be
With
this
fielddew
consecrate
Every
fairy
take
his
gait
And
each
several
chamber
bless
Through
this
palace
with
sweet
peace
And
the
owner
of
it
blest
Ever
shall
in
safety
rest
Trip
away
make
no
stay
Meet
me
all
by
break
of
day
If
we
shadows
have
offended
Think
but
this
and
all
is
mended
That
you
have
but
slumbred
here
While
these
visions
did
appear
And
this
weak
and
idle
theme
No
more
yielding
but
a
dream
Gentles
do
not
reprehend
If
you
pardon
we
will
mend
And
as
I
am
an
honest
Puck
If
we
have
unearned
luck
Now
to
scape
the
serpents
tongue
We
will
make
amends
ere
long
Else
the
Puck
a
liar
call
So
good
night
unto
you
all
Give
me
your
hands
if
we
be
friends
And
Robin
shall
restore
amends
I
Scene
I
An
orchard
before
Leonatos
house
Enter
Leonato
Governor
of
Messina
Hero
his
Daughter
and
Beatrice
his
Niece
with
a
Messenger
Leon
I
learn
in
this
letter
that
Don
Pedro
of
Arragon
comes
this
night
to
Messina
Mess
He
is
very
near
by
this
He
was
not
three
leagues
off
when
I
left
him
Leon
How
many
gentlemen
have
you
lost
in
this
action
Mess
But
few
of
any
sort
and
none
of
name
Leon
victory
is
twice
itself
when
the
achiever
brings
home
full
numbers
I
find
here
that
Don
Pedro
hath
bestowed
much
honour
on
a
young
Florentine
called
Claudio
Mess
Much
deservd
on
his
part
and
equally
remembred
by
Don
Pedro
He
hath
borne
himself
beyond
the
promise
of
his
age
doing
in
the
figure
of
a
lamb
the
feats
of
a
lion
He
hath
indeed
better
bettred
expectation
than
you
must
expect
of
me
to
tell
you
how
Leon
He
hath
an
uncle
here
in
Messina
will
be
very
much
glad
of
it
Mess
I
have
already
delivered
him
letters
and
there
appears
much
joy
in
him
even
so
much
that
joy
could
not
show
itself
modest
enough
without
a
badge
of
bitterness
Leon
Did
he
break
out
into
tears
Mess
In
great
measure
Leon
kind
overflow
of
kindness
There
are
no
faces
truer
than
those
that
are
so
washd
How
much
better
is
it
to
weep
at
joy
than
to
joy
at
weeping
Beat
I
pray
you
is
Signior
Mountanto
returnd
from
the
wars
or
no
Mess
I
know
none
of
that
name
lady
There
was
none
such
in
the
army
of
any
sort
Leon
What
is
he
that
you
ask
for
niece
Hero
My
cousin
means
Signior
Benedick
of
Padua
Mess
hes
returnd
and
as
pleasant
as
ever
he
was
Beat
He
set
up
his
bills
here
in
Messina
and
challengd
Cupid
at
the
flight
and
my
uncles
fool
reading
the
challenge
subscribd
for
Cupid
and
challengd
him
at
the
burbolt
I
pray
you
how
many
hath
he
killd
and
eaten
in
these
wars
But
how
many
hath
he
killd
For
indeed
I
promised
to
eat
all
of
his
killing
Leon
Faith
niece
you
tax
Signior
Benedick
too
much
but
hell
be
meet
with
you
I
doubt
it
not
Mess
He
hath
done
good
service
lady
in
these
wars
Beat
You
had
musty
victual
and
he
hath
holp
to
eat
it
He
is
a
very
valiant
trencherman
he
hath
an
excellent
stomach
Mess
And
a
good
soldier
too
lady
Beat
And
a
good
soldier
to
a
lady
but
what
is
he
to
a
lord
Mess
lord
to
a
lord
a
man
to
a
man
stuffd
with
all
honourable
virtues
Beat
It
is
so
indeed
He
is
no
less
than
a
stuffd
man
but
for
the
stuffingwell
we
are
all
mortal
Leon
You
must
not
sir
mistake
my
niece
There
is
a
kind
of
merry
war
betwixt
Signior
Benedick
and
her
They
never
meet
but
theres
a
skirmish
of
wit
between
them
Beat
Alas
he
gets
nothing
by
that
In
our
last
conflict
four
of
his
five
wits
went
halting
off
and
now
is
the
whole
man
governd
with
one
so
that
if
he
have
wit
enough
to
keep
himself
warm
let
him
bear
it
for
a
difference
between
himself
and
his
horse
for
it
is
all
the
wealth
that
he
hath
left
to
be
known
a
reasonable
creature
Who
is
his
companion
now
He
hath
every
month
a
new
sworn
brother
Mess
Ist
possible
Beat
Very
easily
possible
He
wears
his
faith
but
as
the
fashion
of
his
hat
it
ever
changes
with
the
next
block
Mess
I
see
lady
the
gentleman
is
not
in
your
books
Beat
No
An
he
were
I
would
burn
my
study
But
I
pray
you
who
is
his
companion
Is
there
no
young
squarer
now
that
will
make
a
voyage
with
him
to
the
devil
Mess
He
is
most
in
the
company
of
the
right
noble
Claudio
Beat
Lord
he
will
hang
upon
him
like
a
disease
He
is
sooner
caught
than
the
pestilence
and
the
taker
runs
presently
mad
God
help
the
noble
Claudio
If
he
have
caught
the
Benedick
it
will
cost
him
a
thousand
pound
ere
a
be
cured
Mess
I
will
hold
friends
with
you
lady
Beat
Do
good
friend
Leon
You
will
never
run
mad
niece
Beat
No
not
till
a
hot
January
Mess
Don
Pedro
is
approachd
Enter
Don
Pedro
Claudio
Benedick
Balthasar
and
John
the
Bastard
Pedro
Good
Signior
Leonato
are
you
come
to
meet
your
trouble
The
fashion
of
the
world
is
to
avoid
cost
and
you
encounter
it
Leon
Never
came
trouble
to
my
house
in
the
likeness
of
your
Grace
for
trouble
being
gone
comfort
should
remain
but
when
you
depart
from
me
sorrow
abides
and
happiness
takes
his
leave
Pedro
You
embrace
your
charge
too
willingly
I
think
this
is
your
daughter
Leon
Her
mother
hath
many
times
told
me
so
Bene
Were
you
in
doubt
sir
that
you
askd
her
Leon
Signior
Benedick
no
for
then
were
you
a
child
Pedro
You
have
it
full
Benedick
We
may
guess
by
this
what
you
are
being
a
man
Truly
the
lady
fathers
herself
Be
happy
lady
for
you
are
like
an
honourable
father
Bene
If
Signior
Leonato
be
her
father
she
would
not
have
his
head
on
her
shoulders
for
all
Messina
as
like
him
as
she
is
Beat
I
wonder
that
you
will
still
be
talking
Signior
Benedick
Nobody
marks
you
Bene
What
my
dear
Lady
Disdain
are
you
yet
living
Beat
Is
it
possible
Disdain
should
die
while
she
hath
such
meet
food
to
feed
it
as
Signior
Benedick
Courtesy
itself
must
convert
to
disdain
if
you
come
in
her
presence
Bene
Then
is
courtesy
a
turncoat
But
it
is
certain
I
am
loved
of
all
ladies
only
you
excepted
and
I
would
I
could
find
in
my
heart
that
I
had
not
a
hard
heart
for
truly
I
love
none
Beat
dear
happiness
to
women
They
would
else
have
been
troubled
with
a
pernicious
suitor
I
thank
God
and
my
cold
blood
I
am
of
your
humour
for
that
I
had
rather
hear
my
dog
bark
at
a
crow
than
a
man
swear
he
loves
me
Bene
God
keep
your
ladyship
still
in
that
mind
So
some
gentleman
or
other
shall
scape
a
predestinate
scratchd
face
Beat
Scratching
could
not
make
it
worse
an
twere
such
a
face
as
yours
were
Bene
Well
you
are
a
rare
parrotteacher
Beat
bird
of
my
tongue
is
better
than
a
beast
of
yours
Bene
I
would
my
horse
had
the
speed
of
your
tongue
and
so
good
a
continuer
But
keep
your
way
a
Gods
name
I
have
done
Beat
You
always
end
with
a
jades
trick
I
know
you
of
old
Pedro
That
is
the
sum
of
all
Leonato
Signior
Claudio
and
Signior
Benedick
my
dear
friend
Leonato
hath
invited
you
all
I
tell
him
we
shall
stay
here
at
the
least
a
month
and
he
heartly
prays
some
occasion
may
detain
us
longer
I
dare
swear
he
is
no
hypocrite
but
prays
from
his
heart
Leon
If
you
swear
my
lord
you
shall
not
be
forsworn
To
Don
John
Let
me
bid
you
welcome
my
lord
Being
reconciled
to
the
Prince
your
brother
I
owe
you
all
duty
John
I
thank
you
I
am
not
of
many
words
but
I
thank
you
Leon
Please
it
your
Grace
lead
on
Pedro
Your
hand
Leonato
We
will
go
together
Claud
Benedick
didst
thou
note
the
daughter
of
Signior
Leonato
Bene
I
noted
her
not
but
I
lookd
on
her
Claud
Is
she
not
a
modest
young
lady
Bene
Do
you
question
me
as
an
honest
man
should
do
for
my
simple
true
judgment
or
would
you
have
me
speak
after
my
custom
as
being
a
professed
tyrant
to
their
sex
Claud
No
I
pray
thee
speak
in
sober
judgment
Bene
Why
i
faith
methinks
shes
too
low
for
a
high
praise
too
brown
for
a
fair
praise
and
too
little
for
a
great
praise
Only
this
commendation
I
can
afford
her
that
were
she
other
than
she
is
she
were
unhandsome
and
being
no
other
but
as
she
is
I
do
not
like
her
Claud
Thou
thinkest
I
am
in
sport
I
pray
thee
tell
me
truly
how
thou
likst
her
Bene
Would
you
buy
her
that
you
enquire
after
her
Claud
Can
the
world
buy
such
a
jewel
Bene
Yea
and
a
case
to
put
it
into
But
speak
you
this
with
a
sad
brow
or
do
you
play
the
flouting
Jack
to
tell
us
Cupid
is
a
good
harefinder
and
Vulcan
a
rare
carpenter
Come
in
what
key
shall
a
man
take
you
to
go
in
the
song
Claud
In
mine
eye
she
is
the
sweetest
lady
that
ever
I
lookd
on
Bene
I
can
see
yet
without
spectacles
and
I
see
no
such
matter
Theres
her
cousin
an
she
were
not
possessd
with
a
furyexceeds
her
as
much
in
beauty
as
the
first
of
May
doth
the
last
of
December
But
I
hope
you
have
no
intent
to
turn
husband
have
you
Claud
I
would
scarce
trust
myself
though
I
had
sworn
the
contrary
if
Hero
would
be
my
wife
Bene
Ist
come
to
this
In
faith
hath
not
the
world
one
man
but
he
will
wear
his
cap
with
suspicion
Shall
I
never
see
a
bachelor
of
threescore
again
Go
to
i
faith
An
thou
wilt
needs
thrust
thy
neck
into
a
yoke
wear
the
print
of
it
and
sigh
away
Sundays
Enter
Don
Pedro
Look
Don
Pedro
is
returned
to
seek
you
Pedro
What
secret
hath
held
you
here
that
you
followed
not
to
Leonatos
Bene
I
would
your
Grace
would
constrain
me
to
tell
Pedro
I
charge
thee
on
thy
allegiance
Bene
You
hear
Count
Claudio
I
can
be
secret
as
a
dumb
man
I
would
have
you
think
so
but
on
my
allegiancemark
you
thison
my
allegiance
he
is
in
love
With
who
Now
that
is
your
Graces
part
Mark
how
short
his
answer
is
With
Hero
Leonatos
short
daughter
Claud
If
this
were
so
so
were
it
uttred
Bene
Like
the
old
tale
my
lord
It
is
not
so
nor
twas
not
so
but
indeed
God
forbid
it
should
be
so
Claud
If
my
passion
change
not
shortly
God
forbid
it
should
be
otherwise
Pedro
Amen
if
you
love
her
for
the
lady
is
very
well
worthy
Claud
You
speak
this
to
fetch
me
in
my
lord
Pedro
By
my
troth
I
speak
my
thought
Claud
And
in
faith
my
lord
I
spoke
mine
Bene
And
by
my
two
faiths
and
troths
my
lord
I
spoke
mine
Claud
That
I
love
her
I
feel
Pedro
That
she
is
worthy
I
know
Bene
That
I
neither
feel
how
she
should
be
loved
nor
know
how
she
should
be
worthy
is
the
opinion
that
fire
cannot
melt
out
of
me
I
will
die
in
it
at
the
stake
Pedro
Thou
wast
ever
an
obstinate
heretic
in
the
despite
of
beauty
Claud
And
never
could
maintain
his
part
but
in
the
force
of
his
will
Bene
That
a
woman
conceived
me
I
thank
her
that
she
brought
me
up
I
likewise
give
her
most
humble
thanks
but
that
I
will
have
a
rechate
winded
in
my
forehead
or
hang
my
bugle
in
an
invisible
baldrick
all
women
shall
pardon
me
Because
I
will
not
do
them
the
wrong
to
mistrust
any
I
will
do
myself
the
right
to
trust
none
and
the
fine
is
for
the
which
I
may
go
the
finer
I
will
live
a
bachelor
Pedro
I
shall
see
thee
ere
I
die
look
pale
with
love
Bene
With
anger
with
sickness
or
with
hunger
my
lord
not
with
love
Prove
that
ever
I
lose
more
blood
with
love
than
I
will
get
again
with
drinking
pick
out
mine
eyes
with
a
balladmakers
pen
and
hang
me
up
at
the
door
of
a
brothel
house
for
the
sign
of
blind
Cupid
Pedro
Well
if
ever
thou
dost
fall
from
this
faith
thou
wilt
prove
a
notable
argument
Bene
If
I
do
hang
me
in
a
bottle
like
a
cat
and
shoot
at
me
and
he
that
hits
me
let
him
be
clappd
on
the
shoulder
and
calld
Adam
Pedro
Well
as
time
shall
try
In
time
the
savage
bull
doth
bear
the
yoke
Bene
The
savage
bull
may
but
if
ever
the
sensible
Benedick
bear
it
pluck
off
the
bulls
horns
and
set
them
in
my
forehead
and
let
me
be
vilely
painted
and
in
such
great
letters
as
they
write
Here
is
good
horse
to
hire
let
them
signify
under
my
sign
Here
you
may
see
Benedick
the
married
man
Claud
If
this
should
ever
happen
thou
wouldst
be
hornmad
Pedro
Nay
if
Cupid
have
not
spent
all
his
quiver
in
Venice
thou
wilt
quake
for
this
shortly
Bene
I
look
for
an
earthquake
too
then
Pedro
Well
you
will
temporize
with
the
hours
In
the
meantime
good
Signior
Benedick
repair
to
Leonatos
commend
me
to
him
and
tell
him
I
will
not
fail
him
at
supper
for
indeed
he
hath
made
great
preparation
Bene
I
have
almost
matter
enough
in
me
for
such
an
embassage
and
so
I
commit
you
Claud
To
the
tuition
of
God
From
my
houseif
I
had
it
Pedro
The
sixth
of
July
Your
loving
friend
Benedick
Bene
Nay
mock
not
mock
not
The
body
of
your
discourse
is
sometime
guarded
with
fragments
and
the
guards
are
but
slightly
basted
on
neither
Ere
you
flout
old
ends
any
further
examine
your
conscience
And
so
I
leave
you
Claud
My
liege
your
Highness
now
may
do
me
good
Pedro
My
love
is
thine
to
teach
Teach
it
but
how
And
thou
shalt
see
how
apt
it
is
to
learn
Any
hard
lesson
that
may
do
thee
good
Claud
Hath
Leonato
any
son
my
lord
Pedro
No
child
but
Hero
shes
his
only
heir
Dost
thou
affect
her
Claudio
ClaudO
my
lord
When
you
went
onward
on
this
ended
action
I
lookd
upon
her
with
a
soldiers
eye
That
likd
but
had
a
rougher
task
in
hand
Than
to
drive
liking
to
the
name
of
love
But
now
I
am
returnd
and
that
warthoughts
Have
left
their
places
vacant
in
their
rooms
Come
thronging
soft
and
delicate
desires
All
prompting
me
how
fair
young
Hero
is
Saying
I
likd
her
ere
I
went
to
wars
Pedro
Thou
wilt
be
like
a
lover
presently
And
tire
the
hearer
with
a
book
of
words
If
thou
dost
love
fair
Hero
cherish
it
And
I
will
break
with
her
and
with
her
father
And
thou
shalt
have
her
Wast
not
to
this
end
That
thou
beganst
to
twist
so
fine
a
story
Claud
How
sweetly
you
do
minister
to
love
That
know
loves
grief
by
his
complexion
But
lest
my
liking
might
too
sudden
seem
I
would
have
salvd
it
with
a
longer
treatise
Pedro
What
need
the
bridge
much
broader
than
the
flood
The
fairest
grant
is
the
necessity
Look
what
will
serve
is
fit
Tis
once
thou
lovest
And
I
will
fit
thee
with
the
remedy
I
know
we
shall
have
revelling
tonight
I
will
assume
thy
part
in
some
disguise
And
tell
fair
Hero
I
am
Claudio
And
in
her
bosom
Ill
unclasp
my
heart
And
take
her
hearing
prisoner
with
the
force
And
strong
encounter
of
my
amorous
tale
Then
after
to
her
father
will
I
break
And
the
conclusion
is
she
shall
be
thine
In
practice
let
us
put
it
presently
Scene
room
in
Leonatos
house
Enter
at
one
door
Leonato
and
at
another
door
Antonio
an
old
man
brother
to
Leonato
Leon
How
now
brother
Where
is
my
cousin
your
son
Hath
he
provided
this
music
Ant
He
is
very
busy
about
it
But
brother
I
can
tell
you
strange
news
that
you
yet
dreamt
not
of
Leon
Are
they
good
Ant
As
the
event
stamps
them
but
they
have
a
good
cover
they
show
well
outward
The
Prince
and
Count
Claudio
walking
in
a
thickpleached
alley
in
mine
orchard
were
thus
much
overheard
by
a
man
of
mine
the
Prince
discovered
to
Claudio
that
he
loved
my
niece
your
daughter
and
meant
to
acknowledge
it
this
night
in
a
dance
and
if
he
found
her
accordant
he
meant
to
take
the
present
time
by
the
top
and
instantly
break
with
you
of
it
Leon
Hath
the
fellow
any
wit
that
told
you
this
Ant
good
sharp
fellow
I
will
send
for
him
and
question
him
yourself
Leon
No
no
We
will
hold
it
as
a
dream
till
it
appear
itself
but
I
will
acquaint
my
daughter
withal
that
she
may
be
the
better
prepared
for
an
answer
if
peradventure
this
be
true
Go
you
and
tell
her
of
it

Son
with

Cousin
you
know
what
you
have
to
do
To
the
Musician
I
cry
you
mercy
friend
Go
you
with
me
and
I
will
use
your
skillGood
cousin

a
care
this
busy
time
Scene
Another
room
in
Leonatos
house
Enter
Sir
John
the
Bastard
and
Conrade
his
companion
Con
What
the
goodyear
my
lord
Why
are
you
thus
out
of
measure
sad
John
There
is
no
measure
in
the
occasion
that
breeds
therefore
the
sadness
is
without
limit
Con
You
should
hear
reason
John
And
when
I
have
heard
it
what
blessings
brings
it
Con
If
not
a
present
remedy
at
least
a
patient
sufferance
John
I
wonder
that
thou
being
as
thou
sayst
thou
art
born
under
Saturn
goest
about
to
apply
a
moral
medicine
to
a
mortifying
mischief
I
cannot
hide
what
I
am
I
must
be
sad
when
I
have
cause
and
smile
at
no
mans
jests
eat
when
I
have
stomach
and
wait
for
no
mans
leisure
sleep
when
I
am
drowsy
and
tend
on
no
mans
business
laugh
when
I
am
merry
and
claw
no
man
in
his
humour
Con
Yea
but
you
must
not
make
the
full
show
of
this
till
you
may
do
it
without
controlment
You
have
of
late
stood
out
against
your
brother
and
he
hath
taen
you
newly
into
his
grace
where
it
is
impossible
you
should
take
true
root
but
by
the
fair
weather
that
you
make
yourself
It
is
needful
that
you
frame
the
season
for
your
own
harvest
John
I
had
rather
be
a
canker
in
a
hedge
than
a
rose
in
his
grace
and
it
better
fits
my
blood
to
be
disdaind
of
all
than
to
fashion
a
carriage
to
rob
love
from
any
In
this
though
I
cannot
be
said
to
be
a
flattering
honest
man
it
must
not
be
denied
but
I
am
a
plaindealing
villain
I
am
trusted
with
a
muzzle
and
enfranchisd
with
a
clog
therefore
I
have
decreed
not
to
sing
in
my
cage
If
I
had
my
mouth
I
would
bite
if
I
had
my
liberty
I
would
do
my
liking
In
the
meantime
let
me
be
that
I
am
and
seek
not
to
alter
me
Con
Can
you
make
no
use
of
your
discontent
John
I
make
all
use
of
it
for
I
use
it
only
Enter

give
you
intelligence
of
an

as
I
was
smoking
a
musty
room
comes

the
Prince
and
Claudio
hand
in

in
sad
conference
I
whipt
me
behind
the

and
there
heard

agreed
upon
that
the
Prince
should
woo
Hero
for
himself
and
having
obtaind
her
give
her

Come

This
may
prove
food
to
my
displeasure
That

all
the
glory
of
my
overthrow
If
I
can
cross
him
any
way
I
bless
myself
every
way
You

both
sure
and
will
assist

Con
To
the
death

Let

the
great
supper
Their
cheer
is
the
greater

I

subdued
Would

Shall

to
be
done

Well

I
hall
in
Leonatos
house
Enter
Leonato
Antonio
his
Brother
Hero
his
Daughter
and
Beatrice
his
Niece
and
a
Kinsman
also
Margaret
and
Ursula
Leon
Was
not
Count
John
here
at
supper
Ant
I
saw
him
not
Beat
How
tartly
that
gentleman
looks
I
never
can
see
him
but
I
am
heartburnd
an
hour
after
Hero
He
is
of
a
very
melancholy
disposition
Beat
He
were
an
excellent
man
that
were
made
just
in
the
midway
between
him
and
Benedick
The
one
is
too
like
an
image
and
says
nothing
and
the
other
too
like
my
ladys
eldest
son
evermore
tattling
Leon
Then
half
Signior
Benedicks
tongue
in
Count
Johns
mouth
and
half
Count
Johns
melancholy
in
Signior
Benedicks
face
Beat
With
a
good
leg
and
a
good
foot
uncle
and
money
enough
in
his
purse
such
a
man
would
win
any
woman
in
the
worldif
a
could
get
her
good
will
Leon
By
my
troth
niece
thou
wilt
never
get
thee
a
husband
if
thou
be
so
shrewd
of
thy
tongue
Ant
In
faith
shes
too
curst
Beat
Too
curst
is
more
than
curst
I
shall
lessen
Gods
sending
that
way
for
it
is
said
God
sends
a
curst
cow
short
horns
but
to
a
cow
too
curst
he
sends
none
Leon
So
by
being
too
curst
God
will
send
you
no
horns
Beat
Just
if
he
send
me
no
husband
for
the
which
blessing
I
am
at
him
upon
my
knees
every
morning
and
evening
Lord
I
could
not
endure
a
husband
with
a
beard
on
his
face
I
had
rather
lie
in
the
woollen
Leon
You
may
light
on
a
husband
that
hath
no
beard
Beat
What
should
I
do
with
him
dress
him
in
my
apparel
and
make
him
my
waiting
gentlewoman
He
that
hath
a
beard
is
more
than
a
youth
and
he
that
hath
no
beard
is
less
than
a
man
and
he
that
is
more
than
a
youth
is
not
for
me
and
he
that
is
less
than
a
man
I
am
not
for
him
Therefore
I
will
even
take
sixpence
in
earnest
of
the
berrord
and
lead
his
apes
into
hell
Leon
Well
then
go
you
into
hell
Beat
No
but
to
the
gate
and
there
will
the
devil
meet
me
like
an
old
cuckold
with
horns
on
his
head
and
say
Get
you
to
heaven
Beatrice
get
you
to
heaven
Heres
no
place
for
you
maids
So
deliver
I
up
my
apes
and
away
to
Saint
Peterfor
the
heavens
He
shows
me
where
the
bachelors
sit
and
there
live
we
as
merry
as
the
day
is
long
Ant
to
Hero
Well
niece
I
trust
you
will
be
ruld
by
your
father
Beat
Yes
faith
It
is
my
cousins
duty
to
make
cursy
and
say
Father
as
it
please
you
But
yet
for
all
that
cousin
let
him
be
a
handsome
fellow
or
else
make
another
cursy
and
say
Father
as
it
please
me
Leon
Well
niece
I
hope
to
see
you
one
day
fitted
with
a
husband
Beat
Not
till
God
make
men
of
some
other
metal
than
earth
Would
it
not
grieve
a
woman
to
be
overmasterd
with
a
piece
of
valiant
dust
to
make
an
account
of
her
life
to
a
clod
of

Daughter
remember
what
I
told
you
If
the

do
solicit
you
in

kind
you
know
your
answer
Beat
The
fault
will
be
in
the
music

if
you
be
not
wooed
in
good
time
If
the
Prince
be
too
important
tell
him
there
is
measure
in
everything
and
so
dance
out
the
answer
For
hear
me
Hero
wooing
wedding

repenting
is
as
a
Scotch

a
measure

a
cinquepace
the

hasty
like

Scotch
jigand
full
as
fantastical
the
wedding
mannerly
modest
as
a
measure
full
of

ancientry
and
then
comes
Repentance
and
with
his
bad

falls
into

At

I

the
waggling

Ant
To

I
counterfeit

Urs
You

Heres

You

Ant
At
a

I
am

Urs
Come
come
do
you
think
I
do
not
know
you
by
your
excellent

Can
virtue
hide
itself
Go
to
mum
you
are
he
Graces
will
appear
and
theres
an
end
They
step
aside
Beat
Will
you
not
tell
me
who
told
you
so
Bene
No
you
shall
pardon
me
Beat
Nor
will
you
not
tell
me
who
you
are
Bene
Not
now
Beat
That
I
was
disdainful
and
that
I
had
my
good
wit
out
of
the
Hundred
Merry
Tales
Well
this
was
Signior
Benedick
that
said
so
Bene
Whats
he
Beat
I
am
sure
you
know
him
well
enough
Bene
Not
I
believe
me
Beat
Did
he
never
make
you
laugh
Bene
I
pray
you
what
is
he
Beat
Why
he
is
the
Princes
jester
a
very
dull
fool
Only
his
gift
is
in
devising
impossible
slanders
None
but
libertines
delight
in
him
and
the
commendation
is
not
in
his
wit
but
in
his
villany
for
he
both
pleases
men
and
angers
them
and
then
they
laugh
at
him
and
beat
him
I
am
sure
he
is
in
the
fleet
I
would
he
had
boarded
me
Bene
When
I
know
the
gentleman
Ill
tell
him
what
you
say
Beat
Do
do
Hell
but
break
a
comparison
or
two
on
me
which
peradventure
not
marked
or
not
laughd
at
strikes
him
into
melancholy
and
then
theres
a
partridge
wing
saved
for
the
fool
will
eat
no
supper
that
night
Music
We
must
follow
the
leaders
Bene
In
every
good
thing
Beat
Nay
if
they
lead
to
any
ill
I
will
leave
them
at
the
next
turning
Dance
John
Sure
my
brother
is
amorous
on
Hero
and
hath
withdrawn
her
father
to
break
with
him
about
it
The
ladies
follow
her
and
but
one
visor
remains
Bora
And
that
is
Claudio
I
know
him
by
his
bearing
John
Are
you
not
Signior
Benedick
Claud
You
know
me
well
I
am
he
John
Signior
you
are
very
near
my
brother
in
his
love
He
is
enamourd
on
Hero
I
pray
you
dissuade
him
from
her
she
is
no
equal
for
his
birth
You
may
do
the
part
of
an
honest
man
in
it
Claud
How
know
you
he
loves
her
John
I
heard
him
swear
his
affection
Bora
So
did
I
too
and
he
swore
he
would
marry
her
tonight
John
Come
let
us
to
the
banquet
Claud
Thus
answer
I
in
name
of
Benedick
But
hear
these
ill
news
with
the
ears
of
Claudio
Unmasks
Tis
certain
so
The
Prince
wooes
for
himself
Friendship
is
constant
in
all
other
things
Save
in
the
office
and
affairs
of
love
Therefore
all
hearts
in
love
use
their
own
tongues
Let
every
eye
negotiate
for
itself
And
trust
no
agent
for
beauty
is
a
witch
Against
whose
charms
faith
melteth
into
blood
This
is
an
accident
of
hourly
proof
Which
I
mistrusted
not
Farewell
therefore
Hero
Enter
Benedick
unmasked
Bene
Count
Claudio
Claud
Yea
the
same
Bene
Come
will
you
go
with
me
Claud
Whither
Bene
Even
to
the
next
willow
about
your
own
business
County
What
fashion
will
you
wear
the
garland
of
about
your
neck
like
an
usurers
chain
or
under
your
arm
like
a
lieutenants
scarf
You
must
wear
it
one
way
for
the
Prince
hath
got
your
Hero
Claud
I
wish
him
joy
of
her
Bene
Why
thats
spoken
like
an
honest
drovier
So
they
sell
bullocks
But
did
you
think
the
Prince
would
have
served
you
thus
Claud
I
pray
you
leave
me
Bene
Ho
now
you
strike
like
the
blind
man
Twas
the
boy
that
stole
your
meat
and
youll
beat
the
post
Claud
If
it
will
not
be
Ill
leave
you
Bene
Alas
poor
hurt
fowl
now
will
he
creep
into
sedges
But
that
my
Lady
Beatrice
should
know
me
and
not
know
me
The
Princes
fool
Ha
it
may
be
I
go
under
that
title
because
I
am
merry
Yea
but
so
I
am
apt
to
do
myself
wrong
I
am
not
so
reputed
It
is
the
base
though
bitter
disposition
of
Beatrice
that
puts
the
world
into
her
person
and
so
gives
me
out
Well
Ill
be
revenged
as
I
may
Enter
Don
Pedro
Pedro
Now
signior
wheres
the
Count
Did
you
see
him
Bene
Troth
my
lord
I
have
played
the
part
of
Lady
Fame
I
found
him
here
as
melancholy
as
a
lodge
in
a
warren
I
told
him
and
I
think
I
told
him
true
that
your
Grace
had
got
the
good
will
of
this
young
lady
and
I
offred
him
my
company
to
a
willow
tree
either
to
make
him
a
garland
as
being
forsaken
or
to
bind
him
up
a
rod
as
being
worthy
to
be
whipt
Pedro
To
be
whipt
Whats
his
fault
Bene
The
flat
transgression
of
a
schoolboy
who
being
overjoyed
with
finding
a
birds
nest
shows
it
his
companion
and
he
steals
it
Pedro
Wilt
thou
make
a
trust
a
transgression
The
transgression
is
in
the
stealer
Bene
Yet
it
had
not
been
amiss
the
rod
had
been
made
and
the
garland
too
for
the
garland
he
might
have
worn
himself
and
the
rod
he
might
have
bestowed
on
you
who
as
I
take
it
have
stoln
his
birds
nest
Pedro
I
will
but
teach
them
to
sing
and
restore
them
to
the
owner
Bene
If
their
singing
answer
your
saying
by
my
faith
you
say
honestly
Pedro
The
Lady
Beatrice
hath
a
quarrel
to
you
The
gentleman
that
dancd
with
her
told
her
she
is
much
wrongd
by
you
Bene
she
misusd
me
past
the
endurance
of
a
block
An
oak
but
with
one
green
leaf
on
it
would
have
answered
her
my
very
visor
began
to
assume
life
and
scold
with
her
She
told
me
not
thinking
I
had
been
myself
that
I
was
the
Princes
jester
that
I
was
duller
than
a
great
thaw
huddling
jest
upon
jest
with
such
impossible
conveyance
upon
me
that
I
stood
like
a
man
at
a
mark
with
a
whole
army
shooting
at
me
She
speaks
poniards
and
every
word
stabs
If
her
breath
were
as
terrible
as
her
terminations
there
were
no
living
near
her
she
would
infect
to
the
North
Star
I
would
not
marry
her
though
she
were
endowed
with
all
that
Adam
had
left
him
before
he
transgressd
She
would
have
made
Hercules
have
turnd
spit
yea
and
have
cleft
his
club
to
make
the
fire
too
Come
talk
not
of
her
You
shall
find
her
the
infernal
Ate
in
good
apparel
I
would
to
God
some
scholar
would
conjure
her
for
certainly
while
she
is
here
a
man
may
live
as
quiet
in
hell
as
in
a
sanctuary
and
people
sin
upon
purpose
because
they
would
go
thither
so
indeed
all
disquiet
horror
and
perturbation
follows
her
Enter
Claudio
and
Beatrice
Leonato
Hero
Pedro
Look
here
she
comes
Bene
Will
your
Grace
command
me
any
service
to
the
worlds
end
I
will
go
on
the
slightest
errand
now
to
the
Antipodes
that
you
can
devise
to
send
me
on
I
will
fetch
you
a
toothpicker

the
furthest

Asia

hair
off
the
great
Chams
beard

embassage
to
the
Pygmiesrather
than

three
words
conference
with
this
harpy
You
have
no
employment
for
me
Pedro
None
but
to
desire
your
good
company
Bene
God
sir
heres
a
dish
I
love
not
I
cannot
endure
my
Lady
Tongue
Pedro
Come
lady
come
you
have
lost
the
heart
of
Signior
Benedick
Beat
Indeed
my
lord
he
lent
it
me
awhile
and
I
gave
him
use
for
ita
double
heart
for
his
single
one
Marry
once
before
he
won
it
of
me
with
false
dice
therefore
your
Grace
may
well
say
I
have
lost
it
Pedro
You
have
put
him
down
lady
you
have
put
him
down
Beat
So
I
would
not
he
should
do
me
my
lord
lest
I
should
prove
the
mother
of
fools
I
have
brought
Count
Claudio
whom
you
sent
me
to
seek
Pedro
Why
how
now
Count
Wherefore
are
you
sad
Claud
Not
sad
my
lord
Pedro
How
then
sick
Claud
Neither
my
lord
Beat
The
Count
is
neither
sad
nor
sick
nor
merry
nor
well
but
civil
countcivil
as
an
orange
and
something
of
that
jealous
complexion
Pedro
I
faith
lady
I
think
your
blazon
to
be
true
though
Ill
be
sworn
if
he
be
so
his
conceit
is
false
Here
Claudio
I
have
wooed
in
thy
name
and
fair
Hero
is
won
I
have
broke
with
her
father
and
his
good
will
obtained
Name

day
of
marriage
and
God
give
thee
joy
Leon
Count

my
daughter
and
with
her
my
fortunes
His
Grace
hath
made
the
match
and
all
grace
say
Amen
to
it
Beat
Speak
Count
tis
your
cue
Claud
Silence
is
the
perfectest
herald
of
joy
I
were
but
little
happy
if
I
could
say
how
much
Lady
as
you
are
mine
I
am
yours
I
give
away
myself
for
you
and
dote
upon
the
exchange
Beat
Speak
cousin
or
if
you
cannot
stop
his
mouth
with
a
kiss
and
let
not
him
speak
neither
Pedro
In
faith
lady
you
have
a
merry
heart
Beat
Yea
my
lord
I
thank
it
poor
fool
it
keeps
on
the
windy
side
of
care
My
cousin
tells
him
in
his
ear
that
he
is
in
her
heart
Claud
And
so
she
doth
cousin
Beat
Good
Lord
for
alliance
Thus
goes
every
one
to
the
world
but
I
and
I
am
sunburnt
I
may
sit
in
a
corner
and
cry
Heighho

Pedro
Lady

I
will
get

I
would
rather

getting
Hath

Your

excellent
husbands
if
a

could
come
by
them
Pedro
Will
you
have
me
lady
Beat
No
my
lord
unless
I
might
have
another
for
working
days
your
Grace
is
too
costly
to
wear
every
day
But
I
beseech
your
Grace
pardon
me
I
was
born
to
speak
all
mirth
and
no
matter
Pedro
Your
silence
most
offends
me
and
to
be
merry
best
becomes
you
for
out
o
question
you
were
born
in
a
merry
hour
Beat
No

By
your
Graces
pardon
Pedro
By
my
troth
a
pleasantspirited
lady
Leon
Theres
little
of
the
melancholy
element
in
her
my
lord
She
is
never
sad
but
when
she
sleeps
and
not
ever
sad
then
for
I
have
heard
my
daughter
say
she
hath
often
dreamt
of
unhappiness
and
wakd
herself
with
laughing
Pedro
She
cannot
endure
to
hear
tell
of
a
husband
Leon
by
no
means
She
mocks
all
her
wooers
out
of
suit
Pedro
She
were
an
excellent
wife
for
Benedick
Leon
Lord
my
lord
if
they
were
but
a
week
married
they
would
talk
themselves
mad
Pedro
County

Leon
Not
till
Monday
my
dear
son
which
is
hence
a
just
sevennight
and
a
time
too
brief
too
to
have
all
things
answer
my
mind
Pedro
Come
you
shake
the
head
at
so
long
a
breathing
but
I
warrant
thee
Claudio
the
time
shall
not
go
dully
by
us
I
will
in
the
interim
undertake
one
of
Hercules
labours
which
is
to
bring
Signior
Benedick
and
the
Lady
Beatrice
into
a
mountain
of
affection
th
one
with
th
other
I
would
fain
have
it
a
match
and
I
doubt
not
but
to
fashion
it
if
you
three
will
but
minister
such
assistance
as
I
shall
give
you
direction
Leon
My
lord
I
am
for
you
though
it
cost
me
ten
nights
watchings
Claud
And
I
my
lord
Pedro
And
you
too
gentle
Hero
Hero
I
will
do
any
modest
office
my
lord
to
help
my
cousin
to
a
good
husband
Pedro
And
Benedick
is
not
the
unhopefullest
husband
that
I
know
Thus
far
can
I
praise
him
he
is
of
a
noble
strain
of
approved
valour
and
confirmd
honesty
I
will
teach
you
how
to
humour
your
cousin
that
she
shall
fall
in
love
with
Benedick
and
I
to
Leonato
and
Claudio
with
your
two
helps
will
so
practise
on
Benedick
that
in
despite
of
his
quick
wit
and
his
queasy
stomach
he
shall
fall
in
love
with
Beatrice
If
we
can
do
this
Cupid
is
no
longer
an
archer
his
glory
shall
be
ours
for
we
are
the
only
lovegods
Go
in
with
me
and
I
will
tell
you
my
drift

John
Any

any
cross
any
impediment

I
am
sick
in
displeasure
to
him
and
whatsoever
comes
athwart
his
affection
ranges
evenly
with
mine
How
canst
thou
cross
this
marriage
Bora
Not
honestly
my
lord
but
so
covertly
that
no
dishonesty
shall
appear
in
me
John
Show
me
briefly
how
Bora
I
think
I
told
your
lordship
a
year
since
how
much
I
am
in
the
favour
of
Margaret
the
waiting
gentlewoman
to
Hero
John
I
remember
Bora
I
can
at
any
unseasonable
instant
of
the
night
appoint
her
to
look
out
at
her
ladys
chamber
window
John
What
life
is
in
that
to
be
the
death
of
this
marriage
Bora
The
poison
of
that
lies
in
you
to
temper
Go
you
to
the
Prince
your
brother
spare
not
to
tell
him
that
he
hath
wronged
his
honour
in
marrying
the
renowned
Claudio
whose
estimation
do
you
mightily
hold
up
to
a
contaminated
stale
such
a
one
as
Hero
John
What
proof
shall
I
make
of
that
Bora
Proof
enough
to
misuse
the
Prince
to
vex
Claudio
to
undo
Hero
and
kill
Leonato
Look
you
for
any
other
issue
John
Only
to
despite
them
I
will
endeavour
anything
Bora
Go
then
find
me
a
meet
hour
to
draw
Don
Pedro
and
the
Count
Claudio
alone
tell
them
that
you
know
that
Hero
loves
me
intend
a
kind
of
zeal
both
to
the
Prince
and
Claudio
asin
love
of
your
brothers
honour
who
hath
made
this
match
and
his
friends
reputation
who
is
thus
like
to
be
cozend
with
the
semblance
of
a
maidthat
you
have
discoverd
thus
They
will
scarcely
believe
this
without
trial
Offer
them
instances
which
shall
bear
no
less
likelihood
than
to
see
me
at
her
chamber
window
hear
me
call
Margaret
Hero
hear
Margaret
term
me
Claudio
and
bring
them
to
see
this
the
very
night
before
the
intended
wedding
for
in
the
meantime
I
will
so
fashion
the
matter
that
Hero
shall
be
absent
and
there
shall
appear
such
seeming
truth
of
Heros
disloyalty
that
jealousy
shall
be
calld
assurance
and
all
the
preparation
overthrown
John
Grow
this
to
what
adverse
issue
it
can
I
will
put
it
in
practice
Be
cunning
in
the
working
this
and
thy
fee
is
a
thousand
ducats
Bora
Be
you
constant
in
the
accusation
and
my
cunning
shall
not
shame
me
John
I
will
presently
go
learn
their
day
of
marriage

Boy
Signior
Bene
In
my
chamber

lies
a
book
Bring
it
hither
to
me
in
the
orchard
Boy
I
am
here
already
sir
Bene
I
know
that
but
I
would
have
thee
hence
and
here
again
another
man
is
a
fool
when
he
dedicates
his
behaviours
to
love
will
after
he
hath
laughd
at
such
shallow
follies
in
others
become
the
argument
of
his
own
scorn
by
falling
in
love
and
such
a
man
is
Claudio
I
have
known
when
there
was
no
music
with
him
but
the
drum
and
the
fife
and
now
had
he
rather
hear
the
tabor
and
the
pipe
I
have
known
when
he
would
have
walkd
ten
mile
afoot
to
see
a
good
armour
and
now
will
he
lie
ten
nights
awake
carving
the
fashion
of
a
new
doublet
He
was
wont
to
speak
plain
and
to
the
purpose
like
an
honest
man
and
a
soldier
and
now
is
he
turnd
orthography
his
words
are
a
very
fantastical
banquet
just
so
many
strange
dishes
May
I
be
so
converted
and
see
with
these
eyes
I
cannot
tell
I
think
not
I
will
not
be
sworn
but
love
may
transform
me
to
an
oyster
but
Ill
take
my
oath
on
it
till
he
have
made
an
oyster
of
me
he
shall
never
make
me
such
a
fool
One
woman
is
fair

I
am
well

Come

As

See
you
where
Benedick
hath
hid

Music

Come

Balth
good
my

tax
not
so
bad
a
voice
To
slander
music
any
more
than
once
Pedro
It
is
the
witness
still
of
excellency
To
put
a
strange
face
on
his
own
perfection
I
pray
thee
sing
and
let
me
woo
no
more
Balth
Because
you
talk
of
wooing
I
will
sing
Since
many
a
wooer
doth
commence
his
suit
To
her
he
thinks
not
worthy
yet
he
wooes
Yet
will
he
swear
he
loves
Pedro
Nay
pray
thee
come
Or
if
thou
wilt
hold
longer
argument
Do
it
in
notes
Balth
Note
this
before
my
notes
Theres
not
a
note
of
mine
thats
worth
the
noting
Pedro
Why
these
are
very
crotchets
that
he
speaks
Note
notes
forsooth
and
nothing
Music
Bene

Now
divine

Now
is
his

ravishd
Is
it
not

Well

Sigh

Men
were
deceivers

One

To

But
let

go
And

Converting

Into
Hey

Of

The

Since

By

And
an

Ha
no

Thou
singst

Bene

An
he
had
been
a

they
would
have
hangd

bode
no

Pedro
Yea

Dost
thou
hear
Balthasar
I
pray
thee
get
us
some
excellent
music
for
tomorrow
night
we
would
have
it
at
the
Lady
Heros
chamber
window
Balth
The
best
I
can
my
lord
Pedro
Do
so
Farewell
Come
hither
Leonato
What
was
it
you
told
me
of
today
that
your
niece
Beatrice
was
in
love
with
Signior
Benedick
Claud
ayAside
to
Pedro
Stalk
on
stalk
on
the
fowl
sits
I
did
never
think
that
lady
would
have
loved
any
man
Leon
No
nor
I
neither
but
most
wonderful
that
she
should
so
dote
on
Signior
Benedick
whom
she
hath
in
all
outward
behaviours
seemd
ever
to
abhor
Bene
aside
Ist
possible
Sits
the
wind
in
that
corner
Leon
By
my
troth
my
lord
I
cannot
tell
what
to
think
of
it
but
that
she
loves
him
with
an
enraged
affection
It
is
past
the
infinite
of
thought
Pedro
May
be
she
doth
but
counterfeit
Claud
Faith
like
enough
Leon
God
counterfeit
There
was
never
counterfeit
of
passion
came
so
near
the
life
of
passion
as
she
discovers
it
Pedro
Why
what
effects
of
passion
shows
she
Claud
aside
Bait
the
hook
well
This
fish
will
bite
Leon
What
effects
my
lord
She
will
sit
youyou
heard
my
daughter
tell
you
how
Claud
She
did
indeed
Pedro
How
how
I
pray
you
You
amaze
me
I
would
have
thought
her
spirit
had
been
invincible
against
all
assaults
of
affection
Leon
I
would
have
sworn
it
had
my
lordespecially
against
Benedick
Bene
aside
I
should
think
this
a
gull
but
that
the
whitebearded
fellow
speaks
it
Knavery
cannot
sure
hide
himself
in
such
reverence
Claud
aside
He
hath
taen
th
infection
Hold
it
up
Pedro
Hath
she
made
her
affection
known
to
Benedick
Leon
No
and
swears
she
never
will
Thats
her
torment
Claud
Tis
true
indeed
So
your
daughter
says
Shall
I
says
she
that
have
so
oft
encountred
him
with
scorn
write
to
him
that
I
love
him
Leon
This
says
she
now
when
she
is
beginning
to
write
to
him
for
shell
be
up
twenty
times
a
night
and
there
will
she
sit
in
her
smock
till
she
have
writ
a
sheet
of
paper
My
daughter
tells
us
all
Claud
Now
you
talk
of
a
sheet
of
paper
I
remember
a
pretty
jest
your
daughter
told
us
of
Leon
when
she
had
writ
it
and
was
reading
it
over
she
found
Benedick
and
Beatrice
between
the
sheet
Claud
That
Leon
she
tore
the
letter
into
a
thousand
halfpence
raild
at
herself
that
she
should
be
so
immodest
to
write
to
one
that
she
knew
would
flout
her
I
measure
him
says
she
by
my
own
spirit
for
I
should
flout
him
if
he
writ
to
me
Yea
though
I
love
him
I
should
Claud
Then
down
upon
her
knees
she
falls
weeps
sobs
beats
her
heart
tears
her
hair
prays
cursesO
sweet
Benedick
God
give
me
patience
Leon
She
doth
indeed
my
daughter
says
so
And
the
ecstasy
hath
so
much
overborne
her
that
my
daughter
is
sometime
afeard
she
will
do
a
desperate
outrage
to
herself
It
is
very
true
Pedro
It
were
good
that
Benedick
knew
of
it
by
some
other
if
she
will
not
discover
it
Claud
To
what
end
He
would
make
but
a
sport
of
it
and
torment
the
poor
lady
worse
Pedro
An
he
should
it
were
an
alms
to
hang
him
Shes
an
excellent
sweet
lady
and
out
of
all
suspicion
she
is
virtuous
Claud
And
she
is
exceeding
wise
Pedro
In
everything
but
in
loving
Benedick
Leon
my
lord
wisdom
and
blood
combating
in
so
tender
a
body
we
have
ten
proofs
to
one
that
blood
hath
the
victory
I
am
sorry
for
her
as
I
have
just
cause
being
her
uncle
and
her
guardian
Pedro
I
would
she
had
bestowed
this
dotage
on
me
I
would
have
daffd
all
other
respects
and
made
her
half
myself
I
pray
you
tell
Benedick
of
it
and
hear
what
a
will
say
Leon
Were
it
good
think
you
Claud
Hero
thinks
surely
she
will
die
for
she
says
she
will
die
if
he
love
her
not
and
she
will
die
ere
she
make
her
love
known
and
she
will
die
if
he
woo
her
rather
than
she
will
bate
one
breath
of
her
accustomed
crossness
Pedro
She
doth
well
If
she
should
make
tender
of
her
love
tis
very
possible
hell
scorn
it
for
the
man
as
you
know
all
hath
a
contemptible
spirit
Claud
He
is
a
very
proper
man
Pedro
He
hath
indeed
a
good
outward
happiness
Claud
Before
God
and
in
my
mind
very
wise
Pedro
He
doth
indeed
show
some
sparks
that
are
like
wit
Claud
And
I
take
him
to
be
valiant
Pedro
As
Hector
I
assure
you
and
in
the
managing
of
quarrels
you
may
say
he
is
wise
for
either
he
avoids
them
with
great
discretion
or
undertakes
them
with
a
most
Christianlike
fear
Leon
If
he
do
fear
God
a
must
necessarily
keep
peace
If
he
break
the
peace
he
ought
to
enter
into
a
quarrel
with
fear
and
trembling
Pedro
And
so
will
he
do
for
the
man
doth
fear
God
howsoever
it
seems
not
in
him
by
some
large
jests
he
will
make
Well
I
am
sorry
for
your
niece
Shall
we
go
seek
Benedick
and
tell
him
of
her
love
Claud
Never
tell
him
my
lord
Let
her
wear
it
out
with
good
counsel
Leon
Nay
thats
impossible
she
may
wear
her
heart
out
first
Pedro
Well
we
will
hear
further
of
it
by
your
daughter
Let
it
cool
the
while
I
love
Benedick
well
and
I
could
wish
he
would
modestly
examine
himself
to
see
how
much
he
is
unworthy
so
good
a
lady
Leon
My
lord
will
you
walk
Dinner
is
ready
They
walk
away
Claud
If
he
dote
on
her
upon
this
I
will
never
trust
my
expectation
Pedro
Let
there
be
the
same
net
spread
for
her
and
that
must
your
daughter
and
her
gentlewomen
carry
The
sport
will
be
when
they
hold
one
an
opinion
of
anothers
dotage
and
no
such
matter
Thats
the
scene
that
I
would
see
which
will
be
merely
a
dumb
show
Let
us
send
her
to
call
him
in
to
dinner
Benedick
advances
from
the
arbour
Bene
This
can
be
no
trick
The
conference
was
sadly
borne
they
have
the
truth
of
this
from
Hero
they
seem
to
pity
the
lady
It
seems
her
affections
have
their
full
bent
Love
me
Why
it
must
be
requited
I
hear
how
I
am
censurd
They
say
I
will
bear
myself
proudly
if
I
perceive
the
love
come
from
her
They
say
too
that
she
will
rather
die
than
give
any
sign
of
affection
I
did
never
think
to
marry
I
must
not
seem
proud
Happy
are
they
that
hear
their
detractions
and
can
put
them
to
mending
They
say
the
lady
is
fairtis
a
truth
I
can
bear
them
witness
and
virtuous
tis
so
I
cannot
reprove
it
and
wise
but
for
loving
meby
my
troth
it
is
no
addition
to
her
wit
nor
no
great
argument
of
her
folly
for
I
will
be
horribly
in
love
with
her
I
may
chance
have
some
odd
quirks
and
remnants
of
wit
broken
on
me
because
I
have
railed
so
long
against
marriage
But
doth
not
the
appetite
alters
man
loves
the
meat
in
his
youth
that
he
cannot
endure
in
his
age
Shall
quips
and
sentences
and
these
paper
bullets
of
the
brain
awe
a
man
from
the
career
of
his
humour
No
the
world
must
be
peopled
When
I
said
I
would
die
a
bachelor
I
did
not
think
I
should
live
till
I
were
married
Enter
Beatrice
Here
comes
Beatrice
By
this
day
shes
a
fair
lady
I
do
spy
some
marks
of
love
in
her
Beat
Against
my
will
I
am
sent
to
bid
You
come
in
to
dinner
Bene
Fair
Beatrice
I
thank
you
for
your
pains
Beat
I
took
no
more
pains
for
those
thanks
than
you
take
pains
to
thank
me
If
it
had
been
painful
I
would
not
have
come
Bene
You
take
pleasure
then
in
the
message
Beat
Yea
just
so
much
as
you
may
take
upon
a
knives
point
and
choke
a
daw
withal
You
have
no
stomach
signior
Fare
you
well
Bene
Ha
Against
my
will
I
am
sent
to
bid
you
come
in
to
dinner
Theres
a
double
meaning
in
that
I
took
no
more
pains
for
those
thanks
than
you
took
pains
to
thank
me
Thats
as
much
as
to
say
Any
pains
that
I
take
for
you
is
as
easy
as
thanks
If
I
do
not
take
pity
of
her
I
am
a
villain
if
I
do
not
love
her
I
am
a
Jew
I
will
go
get
her
picture

come
I
warrant
you
presently
Hero
Now
Ursula
when
Beatrice
doth
come
As
we
do
trace
this
alley
up
and
down
Our
talk
must
only
be
of
Benedick
When
I
do
name
him
let
it
be
thy
part
To
praise
him
more
than
ever
man
did
merit
My
talk
to
thee
must
be
how
Benedick
Is
sick
in
love
with
Beatrice
Of
this
matter
Is
little
Cupids
crafty
arrow
made
That
only
wounds
by
hearsay
Enter
Beatrice
Now
begin
For
look
where
Beatrice
like
a
lapwing
runs
Close
by
the
ground
to
hear
our
conference
Beatrice
hides
in
the
arbour
Urs
The
pleasantst
angling
is
to
see
the
fish
Cut
with
her
golden
oars
the
silver
stream
And
greedily
devour
the
treacherous
bait
So
angle
we
for
Beatrice
who
even
now
Is
couched
in
the
woodbine
coverture
Fear
you
not
my
part
of
the
dialogue
Hero
Then
go
we
near
her
that
her
ear
lose
nothing
Of
the
false
sweet
bait
that
we
lay
for
it
They
approach
the
arbour
No
truly
Ursula
she
is
too
disdainful
I
know
her
spirits
are
as
coy
and
wild
As
haggards
of
the
rock
Urs
But
are
you
sure
That
Benedick
loves
Beatrice
so
entirely
Hero
So
says
the
Prince
and
my
newtrothed
lord
Urs
And
did
they
bid
you
tell
her
of
it
madam
Hero
They
did
entreat
me
to
acquaint
her
of
it
But
I
persuaded
them
if
they
lovd
Benedick
To
wish
him
wrestle
with
affection
And
never
to
let
Beatrice
know
of
it
Urs
Why
did
you
so
Doth
not
the
gentleman
Deserve
as
full
as
fortunate
a
bed
As
ever
Beatrice
shall
couch
upon
Hero
god
of
love
I
know
he
doth
deserve
As
much
as
may
be
yielded
to
a
man
But
Nature
never
framd
a
womans
heart
Of
prouder
stuff
than
that
of
Beatrice
Disdain
and
scorn
ride
sparkling
in
her
eyes
Misprizing
what
they
look
on
and
her
wit
Values
itself
so
highly
that
to
her
All
matter
else
seems
weak
She
cannot
love
Nor
take
no
shape
nor
project
of
affection
She
is
so
selfendeared
Urs
Sure
I
think
so
And
therefore
certainly
it
were
not
good
She
knew
his
love
lest
shell
make
sport
at
it
Hero
Why
you
speak
truth
I
never
yet
saw
man
How
wise
how
noble
young
how
rarely
featurd
But
she
would
spell
him
backward
If
fairfacd
She
would
swear
the
gentleman
should
be
her
sister
If
black
why
Nature
drawing
of
an
antic
Made
a
foul
blot
if
tall
a
lance
illheaded
If
low
an
agate
very
vilely
cut
If
speaking
why
a
vane
blown
with
all
winds
If
silent
why
a
block
moved
with
none
So
turns
she
every
man
the
wrong
side
out
And
never
gives
to
truth
and
virtue
that
Which
simpleness
and
merit
purchaseth
Urs
Sure
sure
such
carping
is
not
commendable
Hero
No
not
to
be
so
odd
and
from
all
fashions
As
Beatrice
is
cannot
be
commendable
But
who
dare
tell
her
so
If
I
should
speak
She
would
mock
me
into
air
she
would
laugh
me
Out
of
myself
press
me
to
death
with
wit
Therefore
let
Benedick
like
coverd
fire
Consume
away
in
sighs
waste
inwardly
It
were
a
better
death
than
die
with
mocks
Which
is
as
bad
as
die
with
tickling
Urs
Yet
tell
her
of
it
Hear
what
she
will
say
Hero
No
rather
I
will
go
to
Benedick
And
counsel
him
to
fight
against
his
passion
And
truly
Ill
devise
some
honest
slanders
To
stain
my
cousin
with
One
doth
not
know
How
much
an
ill
word
may
empoison
liking
Urs
do
not
do
your
cousin
such
a
wrong
She
cannot
be
so
much
without
true
judgment
Having
so
swift
and
excellent
a
wit
As
she
is
prizd
to
have
as
to
refuse
So
rare
a
gentleman
as
Signior
Benedick
Hero
He
is
the
only
man
of
Italy
Always
excepted
my
dear
Claudio
Urs
I
pray
you
be
not
angry
with
me
madam
Speaking
my
fancy
Signior
Benedick
For
shape
for
bearing
argument
and
valour
Goes
foremost
in
report
through
Italy
Hero
Indeed
he
hath
an
excellent
good
name
Urs
His
excellence
did
earn
it
ere
he
had
it
When
are
you
married
madam
Hero
Why
every
day
tomorrow
Come
go
in
Ill
show
thee
some
attires
and
have
thy
counsel
Which
is
the
best
to
furnish
me
tomorrow
They
walk
away
Urs
Shes
limd
I
warrant
you
We
have
caught
her
madam
Hero
If
it
prove
so
then
loving
goes
by
haps
Some
Cupid
kills
with
arrows
some
with
traps
Beatrice
advances
from
the
arbour
Beat
What
fire
is
in
mine
ears
Can
this
be
true
Stand
I
condemnd
for
pride
and
scorn
so
much
Contempt
farewell
and
maiden
pride
adieu
No
glory
lives
behind
the
back
of
such
And
Benedick
love
on
I
will
requite
thee
Taming
my
wild
heart
to
thy
loving
hand
If
thou
dost
love
my
kindness
shall
incite
thee
To
bind
our
loves
up
in
a
holy
band
For
others
say
thou
dost
deserve
and
I
Believe
it
better
than
reportingly
Scene
room
in
Leonatos
house
Enter
Don
Pedro
Claudio
Benedick
and
Leonato
Pedro
I
do
but
stay
till
your
marriage
be
consummate
and
then
go
I
toward
Arragon
Claud
Ill
bring
you
thither
my
lord
if
youll
vouchsafe
me
Pedro
Nay
that
would
be
as
great
a
soil
in
the
new
gloss
of
your
marriage
as
to
show
a
child
his
new
coat
and
forbid
him
to
wear
it
I
will
only
be
bold
with
Benedick
for
his
company
for
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
the
sole
of
his
foot
he
is
all
mirth
He
hath
twice
or
thrice
cut
Cupids
bowstring
and
the
little
hangman
dare
not
shoot
at
him
He
hath
a
heart
as
sound
as
a
bell
and
his
tongue
is
the
clapper
for
what
his
heart
thinks
his
tongue
speaks
Bene
Gallants
I
am
not
as
I
have
been
Leon
So
say
I
Methinks
you
are
sadder
Claud
I
hope
he
be
in
love
Pedro
Hang
him
truant
Theres
no
true
drop
of
blood
in
him
to
be
truly
touchd
with
love
If
he
be
sad
he
wants
money
Bene
I
have
the
toothache
Pedro
Draw
it
Bene
Hang
it
Claud
You
must
hang
it
first
and
draw
it
afterwards
Pedro
What
sigh
for
the
toothache
Leon
Where
is
but
a
humour
or
a
worm
Bene
Well
every
one
can
master
a
grief
but
he
that
has
it
Claud
Yet
say
I
he
is
in
love
Pedro
There
is
no
appearance
of
fancy
in
him
unless
it
be
a
fancy
that
he
hath
to
strange
disguises
as
to
be
a
Dutchman
today
a
Frenchman
tomorrow
or
in
the
shape
of
two
countries
at
once
as
a
German
from
the
waist
downward
all
slops
and
a
Spaniard
from
the
hip
upward
no
doublet
Unless
he
have
a
fancy
to
this
foolery
as
it
appears
he
hath
he
is
no
fool
for
fancy
as
you
would
have
it
appear
he
is
Claud
If
he
be
not
in
love
with
some
woman
there
is
no
believing
old
signs
brushes
his
hat
o
mornings
What
should
that
bode
Pedro
Hath
any
man
seen
him
at
the
barbers
Claud
No
but
the
barbers
man
hath
been
seen
with
him
and
the
old
ornament
of
his
cheek
hath
already
stuffd
tennis
balls
Leon
Indeed
he
looks
younger
than
he
did
by
the
loss
of
a
beard
Pedro
Nay
a
rubs
himself
with
civet
Can
you
smell
him
out
by
that
Claud
Thats
as
much
as
to
say
the
sweet
youths
in
love
Pedro
The
greatest
note
of
it
is
his
melancholy
Claud
And
when
was
he
wont
to
wash
his
face
Pedro
Yea
or
to
paint
himself
for
the
which
I
hear
what
they
say
of
him
Claud
Nay
but
his
jesting
spirit
which
is
newcrept
into
a
lutestring
and
now
governd
by
stops
Pedro
Indeed
that
tells
a
heavy
tale
for
him
Conclude
conclude
he
is
in
love
Claud
Nay
but
I
know
who
loves
him
Pedro
That
would
I
know
too
I
warrant
one
that
knows
him
not
Claud
Yes
and
his
ill
conditions
and
in
despite
of
all
dies
for
him
Pedro
She
shall
be
buried
with
her
face
upwards
Bene
Yet
is
this
no
charm
for
the
toothache
Old
signior
walk
aside
with
me
I
have
studied
eight
or
nine
wise
words
to
speak
to
you
which
these
hobbyhorses
must
not
hear
Pedro
For
my
life
to
break
with
him
about
Beatrice
Claud
Tis
even
so
Hero
and
Margaret
have
by
this
played
their
parts
with
Beatrice
and
then
the
two
bears
will
not
bite
one
another
when
they
meet
Enter
John
the
Bastard
John
My
lord
and
brother
God
save
you
Pedro
Good
den
brother
John
If
your
leisure
servd
I
would
speak
with
you
Pedro
In
private
John
If
it
please
you
Yet
Count
Claudio
may
hear
for
what
I
would
speak
of
concerns
him
Pedro
Whats
the
matter
John
to
Claudio
Means
your
lordship
to
be
married
tomorrow
Pedro
You
know
he
does
John
I
know
not
that
when
he
knows
what
I
know
Claud
If
there
be
any
impediment
I
pray
you
discover
it
John
You
may
think
I
love
you
not
Let
that
appear
hereafter
and
aim
better
at
me
by
that
I
now
will
manifest
For
my
brother
I
think
he
holds
you
well
and
in
dearness
of
heart
hath
holp
to
effect
your
ensuing
marriagesurely
suit
ill
spent
and
labour
ill
bestowed
Pedro
Why
whats
the
matter
John
I
came
hither
to
tell
you
and
circumstances
shortned
for
she
has
been
too
long
atalking
of
the
lady
is
disloyal
Claud
Who
Hero
John
Even
sheLeonatos
Hero
your
Hero
every
mans
Hero
Claud
Disloyal
John
The
word
is
too
good
to
paint
out
her
wickedness
I
could
say
she
were
worse
think
you
of
a
worse
title
and
I
will
fit
her
to
it
Wonder
not
till
further
warrant
Go
but
with
me
tonight
you
shall
see
her
chamber
window
entred
even
the
night
before
her
wedding
day
If
you
love
her
then
tomorrow
wed
her
But
it
would
better
fit
your
honour
to
change
your
mind
Claud
May
this
be
so
Pedro
I
will
not
think
it
John
If
you
dare
not
trust
that
you
see
confess
not
that
you
know
If
you
will
follow
me
I
will
show
you
enough
and
when
you
have
seen
more
and
heard
more
proceed
accordingly
Claud
If
I
see
anything
tonight
why
I
should
not
marry
her
tomorrow
in
the
congregation
where
I
should
wed
there
will
I
shame
her
Pedro
And
as
I
wooed
for
thee
to
obtain
her
I
will
join
with
thee
to
disgrace
her
John
I
will
disparage
her
no
farther
till
you
are
my
witnesses
Bear
it
coldly
but
till
midnight
and
let
the
issue
show
itself
Pedro

untowardly
turned
Claud

John

So
will
you
say
when
you
have
seen
the
Sequel
Scene
street
Enter
Dogberry
and
his
compartner
Verges
with
the
Watch
Dog
Are
you
good
men
and
true
Verg
Yea
or
else
it
were
pity
but
they
should
suffer
salvation
body
and
soul
Dog
Nay
that
were
a
punishment
too
good
for
them
if
they
should
have
any
allegiance
in
them
being
chosen
for
the
Princes
watch
Verg
Well
give
them
their
charge
neighbour
Dogberry
Dog
First
who
think
you
the
most
desartless
man
to
be
constable
Watch
Hugh
Oatcake
sir
or
George
Seacoal
for
they
can
write
and
read
Dog
Come
hither
neighbour
Seacoal
God
hath
blessd
you
with
a
good
name
To
be
a
wellfavoured
man
is
the
gift
of
fortune
but
to
write
and
read
comes
by
nature
Watch
Both
which
Master
Constable
Dog
You
have
I
knew
it
would
be
your
answer
Well
for
your
favour
sir
why
give
God
thanks
and
make
no
boast
of
it
and
for
your
writing
and
reading
let
that
appear
when
there
is
no
need
of
such
vanity
You
are
thought
here
to
be
the
most
senseless
and
fit
man
for
the
constable
of
the
watch
Therefore
bear
you
the
lanthorn
This
is
your
charge
you
shall
comprehend
all
vagrom
men
you
are
to
bid
any
man
stand
in
the
Princes
name
Watch
How
if
a
will
not
stand
Dog
Why
then
take
no
note
of
him
but
let
him
go
and
presently
call
the
rest
of
the
watch
together
and
thank
God
you
are
rid
of
a
knave
Verg
If
he
will
not
stand
when
he
is
bidden
he
is
none
of
the
Princes
subjects
Dog
True
and
they
are
to
meddle
with
none
but
the
Princes
subjects
You
shall
also
make
no
noise
in
the
streets
for
for
the
watch
to
babble
and
to
talk
is
most
tolerable
and
not
to
be
endured
Watch
We
will
rather
sleep
than
talk
We
know
what
belongs
to
a
watch
Dog
Why
you
speak
like
an
ancient
and
most
quiet
watchman
for
I
cannot
see
how
sleeping
should
offend
Only
have
a
care
that
your
bills
be
not
stoln
Well
you
are
to
call
at
all
the
alehouses
and
bid
those
that
are
drunk
get
them
to
bed
Watch
How
if
they
will
not
Dog
Why
then
let
them
alone
till
they
are
sober
If
they
make
you
not
then
the
better
answer
You
may
say
they
are
not
the
men
you
took
them
for
Watch
Well
sir
Dog
If
you
meet
a
thief
you
may
suspect
him
by
virtue
of
your
office
to
be
no
true
man
and
for
such
kind
of
men
the
less
you
meddle
or
make
with
them
why
the
more
your
honesty
Watch
If
we
know
him
to
be
a
thief
shall
we
not
lay
hands
on
him
Dog
Truly
by
your
office
you
may
but
I
think
they
that
touch
pitch
will
be
defild
The
most
peaceable
way
for
you
if
you
do
take
a
thief
is
to
let
him
show
himself
what
he
is
and
steal
out
of
your
company
Verg
You
have
been
always
called
a
merciful
man
partner
Dog
Truly
I
would
not
hang
a
dog
by
my
will
much
more
a
man
who
hath
any
honesty
in
him
Verg
If
you
hear
a
child
cry
in
the
night
you
must
call
to
the
nurse
and
bid
her
still
it
Watch
How
if
the
nurse
be
asleep
and
will
not
hear
us
Dog
Why
then
depart
in
peace
and
let
the
child
wake
her
with
crying
for
the
ewe
that
will
not
hear
her
lamb
when
it
baes
will
never
answer
a
calf
when
he
bleats
Verg
Tis
very
true
Dog
This
is
the
end
of
the
charge
you
constable
are
to
present
the
Princes
own
person
If
you
meet
the
Prince
in
the
night
you
may
stay
him
Verg
Nay
byr
lady
that
I
think
a
cannot
Dog
Five
shillings
to
one
ont
with
any
man
that
knows
the
statutes
he
may
stay
him
Marry
not
without
the
Prince
be
willing
for
indeed
the
watch
ought
to
offend
no
man
and
it
is
an
offence
to
stay
a
man
against
his
will
Verg
Byr
lady
I
think
it
be
so
Dog
Ha
ah
ha
Well
masters
good
night
An

any
matter
of
weight

up

Keep
your
fellows

Come

Watch
Well
masters
we
hear
our
charge
Let
us
go
sit
here
upon
the
church
bench
till
two
and
then

One
word

neighbours
I
pray

the
wedding

Stand

like

Is
it
possible
that
any
villany
should
be
so
dear

Thou
shouldst
rather
ask
if
it
were
possible
any
villany
should
be
so
rich
for
when
rich
villains
have
need
of
poor
ones
poor

may
make
what
price
they
will
Con
I
wonder
at
it
Bora
That
shows
thou
art
unconfirmd
Thou
knowest
that
the
fashion
of
a
doublet
or
a
hat
or
a
cloak
is
nothing
to
a
man
Con
Yes
it
is
apparel
Bora
I
mean
the

Con
Yes
the

is
the
fashion

Tush
I
may
as
well
say
the
fools
the
fool
But
seest
thou
not
what
a
deformed
thief
this
fashion
is
Watch
aside
I
know
that
Deformed
bas
been
a
vile
thief
this
seven
year
a
goes
up
and
down
like
a
gentleman
I
remember
his
name
Bora
Didst
thou
not
hear
somebody
Con
No
twas
the
vane
on
the
house
Bora
Seest
thou
not
I
say
what
a
deformed
thief
this
fashion
is
how
giddily
a
turns
about
all
the
hotbloods
between
fourteen
and
fiveandthirty
sometimes
fashioning
them
like
Pharaohs
soldiers
in
the
reechy
painting
sometime
like
god
Bels
priests
in
the
old
church
window
sometime
like
the
shaven
Hercules
in
the
smirchd
wormeaten
tapestry
where
his
codpiece
seems
as
massy
as
his
club
Con
All
this
I
see
and
I
see
that
the
fashion
wears
out
more
apparel
than
the
man
But
art
not
thou
thyself
giddy
with
the
fashion
too
that
thou
hast
shifted
out
of
thy
tale
into
telling
me
of
the
fashion
Bora
Not
so
neither
But
know
that
I
have
tonight
wooed
Margaret
the
Lady
Heros

leans
me

bids
me

the

afar

And
thought

Margaret
was
Hero

Two
of

did
the
Prince

Claudio
but
the
devil
my
master
knew
she
was
Margaret
and
partly
by
his
oaths
which
first
possessd
them
partly
by
the
dark
night
which
did
deceive
them
but
chiefly
by
my
villany
which
did
confirm
any
slander
that
Don
John
had
made
away
went
Claudio
enragd
swore
he
would
meet
her
as

the
sign

semblance

honour
Behold
how
like
a

she
blushes
here
what
authority
and
show
of
truth
Can
cunning
sin
cover
itself
withal
Comes
not
that
blood
as
modest
evidence
To
witness
simple
virtue
Would
you
not
swear
All
you
that
see
her
that
she
were
a
maid
By
these
exterior
shows
But
she
is
none
She
knows
the
heat
of
a
luxurious
bed
Her
blush
is
guiltiness
not
modesty
Leon
What
do
you
mean
my
lord
Claud
Not
to
be
married
Not
to
knit
my
soul
to
an
approved
wanton
Leon
Dear
my
lord
if
you
in
your
own
proof
Have
vanquishd
the
resistance
of
her
youth
And
made
defeat
of
her
virginity
Claud
I
know
what
you
would
say
If
I
have
known
her
You
will
say
she
did
embrace
me
as
a
husband
And
so
extenuate
the
forehand
sin
No
Leonato
I
never
tempted
her
with
word
too
large
But
as
a
brother
to
his
sister
showd
Bashful
sincerity
and
comely
love
Hero
And
seemd
I
ever
otherwise
to
you
Claud
Out
on
the
seeming
I
will
write
against
it
You
seem
to
me
as
Dian
in
her
orb
As
chaste
as
is
the
bud
ere
it
be
blown
But
you
are
more
intemperate
in
your
blood
Than
Venus
or
those
pampred
animals
That
rage
in
savage
sensuality
Hero
Is
my
lord
well
that
he
doth
speak
so
wide
Leon
Sweet

why
speak
not
you
Pedro
What
should
I
speak
I
stand
dishonourd
that
have
gone
about
To
link
my
dear

to
a
common
stale
Leon
Are
these
things
spoken
or
do
I
but
dream
John
Sir
they
are
spoken
and
these
things
are
true

All

what
of
this
my

Claud
Let
me
but
move
one
question
to
your
daughter
And
by
that
fatherly
and
kindly
power
That
you
have
in

bid
her
answer
truly
Leon
I
charge
thee
do
so
as
thou
art
my

Hero
God
defend

How
am
I
beset
What
kind
of
catechising
call
you
this
Claud
To
make
you
answer
truly
to
your
name
Hero
Is
it
not
Hero
Who
can
blot
that
name
With
any
just
reproach

Marry
that

What
man
was
he
talkd
with

yesternight
Out

Now

Why

Upon

Myself

this
grieved

Did
see

hear
her
at

hour
last

Talk
with

Who

Confessd

Fie
fie
they
are

Not

enough
in

Without
offence
to
utter
them
Thus
pretty
lady
I
am
sorry
for
thy
much
misgovernment
Claud

what
a

hadst
thou

If
half

About

impiety
and
impious
purity
For
thee
Ill
lock
up
all
the
gates
of
love
And
on
my
eyelids
shall
conjecture
hang
To
turn
all
beauty
into
thoughts
of
harm
And
never
shall
it
more
be
gracious

Wherefore

Come

These

Smother

Leon
Fate
take
not
away
thy
heavy

Death
is
the
fairest
cover
for
her
shame
That
may
be
wishd
for
Beat
How
now
cousin
Hero
Friar
Have
comfort
lady
Leon
Dost
thou
look
up
Friar
Yea
wherefore
should
she
not
Leon
Wherefore
Why
doth
not
every
earthly
thing
Cry
shame
upon
her
Could
she
here
deny
The
story
that
is
printed
in
her
blood
Do
not
live
Hero
do
not
ope
thine
eyes
For
did
I
think
thou
wouldst
not
quickly
die
Thought
I
thy
spirits
were
stronger
than
thy
shames
Myself
would
on
the
rearward
of
reproaches
Strike
at
thy
life
Grievd
I
I
had
but
one
Child
I
for
that
at
frugal
natures
frame
one
too
much
by
thee
Why
had
I
one
Why
ever
wast
thou
lovely
in
my
eyes
Why
had
I
not
with
charitable
hand
Took
up
a
beggars
issue
at
my
gates
Who
smirched
thus
and
mird
with
infamy
I
might
have
said
No
part
of
it
is
mine
This
shame
derives
itself
from
unknown
loins
But
mine
and
mine
I
lovd
and
mine
I
praisd
And
mine
that
I
was
proud
onmine
so
much
That
I
myself
was
to
myself
not
mine
Valuing
of
herwhy
she
she
is
falln
Into
a
pit
of
ink
that
the
wide
sea
Hath
drops
too
few
to
wash
her
clean
again
And
salt
too
little
which
may
season
give
To
her
foul
tainted
flesh
Bene
Sir
sir
be
patient
For
my
part
I
am
so
attird
in
wonder
I
know
not
what
to
say
Beat
on
my
soul
my
cousin
is
belied
Bene
Lady
were
you
her
bedfellow
last
night
Beat
No
truly
not
although
until
last
night
I
have
this
twelvemonth
been
her
bedfellow
Leon
Confirmd
confirmd
that
is
stronger
made
Which
was
before
barrd
up
with
ribs
of
iron
Would
the
two
princes
lie
and
Claudio
lie
Who
lovd
her
so
that
speaking
of
her
foulness
Washd
it
with
tears
Hence
from
her
let
her
die
Friar
Hear
me
a
little
For
I
have
only
been
silent
so
long
And
given
way
unto
this
course
of
fortune
By
noting
of
the
lady
I
have
markd
thousand
blushing
apparitions
To
start
into
her
face
a
thousand
innocent
shames
In
angel
whiteness
beat
away
those
blushes
And
in
her
eye
there
hath
appeard
a
fire
To
burn
the
errors
that
these
princes
hold
Against
her
maiden
truth
Call
me
a
fool
Trust
not
my
reading
nor
my
observation
Which
with
experimental
seal
doth
warrant
The
tenure
of
my
book
trust
not
my
age
My
reverence
calling
nor
divinity
If
this
sweet
lady
lie
not
guiltless
here
Under
some
biting
error
Leon
Friar
it
cannot
be
Thou
seest
that
all
the
grace
that
she
hath
left
Is
that
she
will
not
add
to
her
damnation
sin
of
perjury
she
not
denies
it
Why
seekst
thou
then
to
cover
with
excuse
That
which
appears
in
proper
nakedness
Friar
Lady
what
man
is
he
you
are
accusd
of
Hero
They
know
that
do
accuse
me
I
know
none
If
I
know
more
of
any
man
alive
Than
that
which
maiden
modesty
doth
warrant
Let
all
my
sins
lack
mercy
my
father
Prove
you
that
any
man
with
me
conversd
At
hours
unmeet
or
that
I
yesternight
Maintaind
the
change
of
words
with
any
creature
Refuse
me
hate
me
torture
me
to
death
Friar
There
is
some
strange
misprision
in
the
princes
Bene
Two
of
them
have
the
very
bent
of
honour
And
if
their
wisdoms
be
misled
in
this
The
practice
of
it
lives
in
John
the
bastard
Whose
spirits
toil
in
frame
of
villanies
Leon
I
know
not
If
they
speak
but
truth
of
her
These
hands
shall
tear
her
If
they
wrong
her
honour
The
proudest
of
them
shall
well
hear
of
it
Time
hath
not
yet
so
dried
this
blood
of
mine
Nor
age
so
eat
up
my
invention
Nor
fortune
made
such
havoc
of
my
means
Nor
my
bad
life
reft
me
so
much
of
friends
But
they
shall
find
awakd
in
such
a
kind
Both
strength
of
limb
and
policy
of
mind
Ability
in
means
and
choice
of
friends
To
quit
me
of
them
throughly
Friar
Pause
awhile
And
let
my
counsel
sway
you
in
this
case
Your
daughter
here
the
princes
left
for
dead
Let
her
awhile
be
secretly
kept
in
And
publish
it
that
she
is
dead
indeed
Maintain
a
mourning
ostentation
And
on
your
familys
old
monument
Hang
mournful
epitaphs
and
do
all
rites
That
appertain
unto
a
burial
Leon
What
shall
become
of
this
What
will
this
do
Friar
Marry
this
well
carried
shall
on
her
behalf
Change
slander
to
remorse
That
is
some
good
But
not
for
that
dream
I
on
this
strange
course
But
on
this
travail
look
for
greater
birth
She
dying
as
it
must
be
so
maintaind
Upon
the
instant
that
she
was
accusd
Shall
be
lamented
pitied
and
excusd
Of
every
hearer
for
it
so
falls
out
That
what
we
have
we
prize
not
to
the
worth
Whiles
we
enjoy
it
but
being
lackd
and
lost
Why
then
we
rack
the
value
then
we
find
The
virtue
that
possession
would
not
show
us
Whiles
it
was
ours
So
will
it
fare
with
Claudio
When
he
shall
hear
she
died
upon
his
words
Th
idea
of
her
life
shall
sweetly
creep
Into
his
study
of
imagination
And
every
lovely
organ
of
her
life
Shall
come
apparelld
in
more
precious
habit
More
moving
delicate
and
full
of
life
Into
the
eye
and
prospect
of
his
soul
Than
when
she
livd
indeed
Then
shall
he
mourn
If
ever
love
had
interest
in
his
liver
And
wish
he
had
not
so
accused
her
No
though
be
thought
his
accusation
true
Let
this
be
so
and
doubt
not
but
success
Will
fashion
the
event
in
better
shape
Than
I
can
lay
it
down
in
likelihood
But
if
all
aim
but
this
be
levelld
false
The
supposition
of
the
ladys
death
Will
quench
the
wonder
of
her
infamy
And
if
it
sort
not
well
you
may
conceal
her
As
best
befits
her
wounded
reputation
In
some
reclusive
and
religious
life
Out
of
all
eyes
tongues
minds
and
injuries
Bene
Signior
Leonato
let
the
friar
advise
you
And
though
you
know
my
inwardness
and
love
Is
very
much
unto
the
Prince
and
Claudio
Yet
by
mine
honour
I
will
deal
in
this
As
secretly
and
justly
as
your
soul
Should
with
your
body
Leon
Being
that
I
flow
in
grief
The
smallest
twine
may
lead
me
Friar
Tis
well
consented
Presently
away
For
to
strange
sores
strangely
they
strain
the
cure
Come
lady
die
to
live
This
wedding
day
Perhaps
is
but
prolongd
Have
patience
and
endure
Bene
Lady
Beatrice
have
you
wept
all
this
while
Beat
Yea
and
I
will
weep
a
while
longer
Bene
I
will
not
desire
that
Beat
You
have
no
reason
I
do
it
freely
Bene
Surely
I
do
believe
your
fair
cousin
is
wronged
Beat
Ah
how
much
might
the
man
deserve
of
me
that
would
right
her
Bene
Is
there
any
way
to
show
such
friendship
Beat
very
even
way
but
no
such
friend
Bene
May
a
man
do
it
Beat
It
is
a
mans
office
but
not
yours
Bene
I
do
love
nothing
in
the
world
so
well
as
you
Is
not
that
strange
Beat
As
strange
as
the
thing
I
know
not
It
were
as
possible
for
me
to
say
I
loved
nothing
so
well
as
you
But
believe
me
not
and
yet
I
lie
not
I
confess
nothing
nor
I
deny
nothing
I
am
sorry
for
my
cousin
Bene
By
my
sword
Beatrice
thou
lovest
me
Beat
Do
not
swear
and
eat
it
Bene
I
will
swear
by
it
that
you
love
me
and
I
will
make
him
eat
it
that
says
I
love
not
you
Beat
Will
you
not
eat
your
word
Bene
With
no
sauce
that
can
be
devised
to
it
I
protest
I
love
thee
Beat
Why
then
God
forgive
me
Bene
What
offence
sweet
Beatrice
Beat
You
have
stayed
me
in
a
happy
hour
I
was
about
to
protest
I
loved
you
Bene
And
do
it
with
all
thy
heart
Beat
I
love
you
with
so
much
of
my
heart
that
none
is
left
to
protest
Bene
Come
bid
me
do
anything
for
thee
Beat
Kill
Claudio
Bene
Ha
not
for
the
wide
world
Beat
You
kill
me
to
deny
it
Farewell
Bene
Tarry
sweet
Beatrice
Beat
I
am
gone
though
I
am
here
There
is
no
love
in
you
Nay
I
pray
you
let
me
go
Bene
Beatrice
Beat
In
faith
I
will
go
Bene
Well
be
friends
first
Beat
You
dare
easier
be
friends
with
me
than
fight
with
mine
enemy
Bene
Is
Claudio
thine
enemy
Beat
Is
a
not
approved
in
the
height
a
villain
that
hath
slandered
scorned
dishonoured
my
kinswoman
that
I
were
a

What
bear
her
in
hand
until
they
come
to
take
hands
and
then
with
public
accusation
uncoverd
slander
unmitigated
rancourO
God
that
I
were
a

I
would
eat
his
heart
in

Hear
me
Beatrice
Beat
Talk
with
a
man
out
at
a
windowa
proper

Bene
Nay

Sweet

that
I
were
a
man
for
his
sake
or
that
I
had
any

would
be
a
man
for
my
sake
But
manhood
is
melted
into
cursies
valour
into
compliment
and
men
are
only
turnd
into
tongue
and
trim
ones
too
He
is
now
as
valiant
as
Hercules
that
only
tells
a
lieand
swears

I
cannot
be

with
wishing
therefore
I
will
die
a

grieving
Bene
Tarry

Beatrice
By
this
hand
I
love
thee
Beat
Use
it
for
my
love
some

pray
thee
cease

Bring

Whose
joy

Measure

and
speak
comfort
to
that
grief
Which
they
themselves
not
feel
but
tasting
it
Their
counsel
turns
to
passion
which
before
Would
give
preceptial
medicine
to
rage
Fetter
strong
madness
in
a
silken
thread
Charm
ache
with
air
and
agony
with
words
No
no
Tis
all
mens
office
to
speak
patience
To
those
that
wring
under
the
load
of
sorrow
But
no
mans
virtue
nor
sufficiency
To
be
so
moral
when
he
shall
endure
The
like
himself
Therefore
give
me
no
counsel
My
griefs
cry
louder
than
advertisement
Ant
Therein
do
men
from
children
nothing
differ
Leon
I
pray
thee
peace
I
will
be
flesh
and
blood
For
there
was
never
yet
philosopher
That
could
endure
the
toothache
patiently
However
they
have
writ
the
style
of
gods
And
made
a
push
at
chance
and
sufferance
Ant
Yet
bend
not
all
the
harm
upon
yourself
Make
those
that
do
offend
you
suffer
too
Leon
There
thou
speakst
reason
Nay
I
will
do
so
My
soul
doth
tell
me
Hero
is
belied
And
that
shall
Claudio
know
so
shall
the
Prince
And
all
of
them
that
thus
dishonour
her
Enter
Don
Pedro
and
Claudio
Ant
Here
comes
the
Prince
and
Claudio
hastily
Pedro
Good
den
Good

Claud
Good
day

both
of
you
Leon
Hear

my
lords
Pedro
We
have
some
haste
Leonato
Leon
Some
haste
my
lord
well

my
lord
Are
you
so
hasty
now
Well
all
is
one
Pedro
Nay
do
not
quarrel
with
us
good
old
man
Ant
If
he
could
right
himself
with
quarrelling
Some
of
us
would
lie
low
Claud
Who
wrongs
him
Leon
Marry
thou
dost
wrong
me
thou
dissembler
thou
Nay
never
lay
thy
hand
upon
thy
sword
I
fear
thee
not
Claud
Mary
beshrew
my
hand
If
it
should
give
your
age
such
cause
of
fear
In
faith
my
hand
meant
nothing
to
my
sword
Leon
Tush
tush
man
never
fleer
and
jest
at
me
I
speak
not
like
a
dotard
nor
a
fool
As
under
privilege
of
age
to
brag
What
I
have
done
being
young
or
what
would
do
Were
I
not
old
Know
Claudio
to
thy
head
Thou
hast
so
wrongd
mine
innocent
child
and
me
That
I
am
forcd
to
lay
my
reverence
by
And
with
grey
hairs
and
bruise
of
many
days
Do
challenge
thee
to
trial
of
a
man
I
say
thou
hast
belied
mine
innocent
child
Thy
slander
hath
gone
through
and
through
her
heart
And
she
lied
buried
with
her
ancestors
in
a
tomb
where
never
scandal
slept
Save
this
of
hers
framd
by
thy
villany
Claud
My
villany
Leon
Thine
Claudio
thine
I
say
Pedro
You
say
not
right
old
man
Leon
My
lord
my
lord
Ill
prove
it
on
his
body
if
he
dare
Despite
his
nice
fence
and
his
active
practice
His
May
of
youth
and
bloom
of
lustihood
Claud
Away
I
will
not
have
to
do
with
you
Leon
Canst

so
daff

Thou
hast
killd
my
child
If
thou
killst
me
boy
thou
shalt
kill
a
man
And
He

kill
two
of
us
and

But

Win

Let

Come

Nay

Leon
Brother
Ant
Content

God

I
lovd
my
niece
And
she
is
dead
slanderd
to
death
by
villains
That

as
well
answer
a
man
indeed
As
I
dare
take
a
serpent
by
the
tongue
Boys
apes
braggarts
jacks
milksops
Leon
Brother
Anthony
Ant
Hold
you
content
What
man
I
know
them
yea
And

they
weigh
even
to
the
utmost
scruple
Scambling
outfacing
fashionmonging
boys
That
lie
and
cog
and
flout
deprave
and
slander
Go
anticly
show
outward
hideousness
And
speak
off
half
a
dozen
dangrous
words
How
they
might
hurt
their
enemies
if
they
durst
And
this
is
all
Leon
But
brother
Anthony
Ant
Come
tis
no
matter
Do
not
you
meddle
let
me
deal
in
this
Pedro
Gentlemen
both
we
will
not
wake
your
patience
My
heart
is
sorry
for
your
daughters
death
But
on
my
honour
she
was
chargd
with
nothing
But
what
was
true
and
very
full
of
proof
Leon
My
lord
my
lord
Pedro
I
will
not
hear
you
Leon
No
Come

will
be
heard
Ant
And

of
us
will
smart
for
it
Enter
Benedick
Pedro
See

Here

the
man
we
went
to
seek
Claud
Now
signior
what
news
Bene
Good
day
my
lord
Pedro
Welcome
signior
You
are
almost
come
to
part
almost
a
fray
Claud
We
had
likd
to
have
had
our
two
noses
snappd
off
with
two
old
men
without
teeth
Pedro
Leonato
and
his
brother
What
thinkst
thou
Had
we
fought
I
doubt
we
should
have
been
too
young
for
them
Bene
In
a
false
quarrel
there
is
no
true
valour
I
came
to
seek
you
both
Claud
We
have
been
up
and
down
to
seek
thee
for
we
are
highproof
melancholy
and
would
fain
have
it
beaten
away
Wilt
thou
use
thy
wit
Bene
It
is
in
my
scabbard
Shall
I
draw
it
Pedro
Dost
thou
wear
thy
wit
by
thy
side
Claud
Never
any
did
so
though
very
many
have
been
beside
their
wit
I
will
bid
thee
draw
as
we
do
the
minstreldraw
to
pleasure
us
Pedro
As
I
am
an
honest
man
he
looks
pale
Art
thou
sick
or
angry
Claud
What
courage
man
What
though
care
killd
a
cat
thou
hast
mettle
enough
in
thee
to
kill
care
Bene
Sir
I
shall
meet
your
wit
in
the
career
an
you
charge
it
against
me
I
pray
you
choose
another
subject
Claud
Nay
then
give
him
another
staff
this
last
was
broke
cross
Pedro
By
this
light
he
changes
more
and
more
I
think
he
be
angry
indeed
Claud
If
he
be
he
knows
how
to
turn
his
girdle
Bene
Shall
I
speak
a
word
in
your
ear
Claud
God
bless
me
from
a
challenge
Bene
aside
to
Claudio
You
are
a
villain
I
jest
not
I
will
make
it
good
how
you
dare
with
what
you
dare
and
when
you
dare
Do
me
right
or
I
will
protest
your
cowardice
You
have
killd
a
sweet
lady
and
her
death
shall
fall
heavy
on
you
Let
me
hear
from
you
Claud
Well
I
will
meet
you
so
I
may
have
good
cheer
Pedro
What
a
feast
a
feast
Claud
I
faith
I
thank
him
he
hath
bid
me
to
a
calves
head
and
a
capon
the
which
if
I
do
not
carve
most
curiously
say
my
knifes
naught
Shall
I
not
find
a
woodcock
too
Bene
Sir
your
wit
ambles
well
it
goes
easily
Pedro
Ill
tell
thee
how
Beatrice
praisd
thy
wit
the
other
day
I
said
thou
hadst
a
fine
wit
True
said
she
a
fine
little
one
No
said
I
a
great
wit
Right
says
she
a
great
gross
one
Nay
said
I
a
good
wit
Just
said
she
it
hurts
nobody
Nay
said
I
the
gentleman
is
wise
Certain
said
she
a
wise
gentleman
Nay
said
I
he
hath
the
tongues
That
I
believe
said
she
for
he
swore
a
thing
to
me
on
Monday
night
which
he
forswore
on
Tuesday
morning
Theres
a
double
tongue
theres
two
tongues
Thus
did
she
an
hour
together
transshape
thy
particular
virtues
Yet
at
last
she
concluded
with
a
sigh
thou
wast
the
properst
man
in
Italy
Claud
For
the
which
she
wept
heartily
and
said
she
cared
not
Pedro
Yea
that
she
did
but
yet
for
all
that
an
if
she
did
not
hate
him
deadly
she
would
love
him
dearly
The
old
mans
daughter
told
us
all
Claud
All
all
and
moreover
God
saw
him
when
he
was
hid
in
the
garden
Pedro
But
when
shall
we
set
the
savage
bulls
horns
on
the
sensible
Benedicks
head
Claud
Yea
and
text
underneath
Here
dwells
Benedick
the
married
man
Bene
Fare
you
well
boy
you
know
my
mind
I
will
leave
you
now
to
your
gossiplike
humour
You
break
jests
as
braggards
do
their
blades
which
God
be
thanked
hurt
not
My
lord
for
your
many
courtesies
I
thank
you
I
must
discontinue
your
company
Your
brother
the
bastard
is
fled
from
Messina
You
have
among
you
killd
a
sweet
and
innocent
lady
For
my
Lord
Lackbeard
there
he
and
I
shall
meet
and
till
then
peace
be
with
him
Pedro
He
is
in
earnest
Claud
In
most
profound
earnest
and
Ill
warrant
you
for
the
love
of
Beatrice
Pedro
And
hath
challengd
thee
Claud
Most
sincerely
Pedro
What
a
pretty
thing
man
is
when
he
goes
in
his
doublet
and
hose
and
leaves
off
his
wit
Enter
Constables
Dogberry
and
Verges
with
the
Watch
leading
Conrade
and
Borachio
Claud
He
is
then
a
giant
to
an
ape
but
then
is
an
ape
a
doctor
to
such
a
man
Pedro
But
soft
you
let
me
be
Pluck
up
my
heart
and
be
sad
Did
he
not
say
my
brother
was
fled
Dog
Come
you
sir
If
justice
cannot
tame
you
she
shall
neer
weigh
more
reasons
in
her
balance
Nay
an
you
be
a
cursing
hypocrite
once
you
must
be
lookd
to
Pedro
How
now
two
of
my
brothers
men
bound
Borachio
one
Claud
Hearken
after
their
offence
my
lord
Pedro
Officers
what
offence
have
these
men
done
Dog
Marry
sir
they
have
committed
false
report
moreover
they
have
spoken
untruths
secondarily
they
are
slanders
sixth
and
lastly
they
have
belied
a
lady
thirdly
they
have
verified
unjust
things
and
to
conclude
they
are
lying
knaves
Pedro
First
I
ask
thee
what
they
have
done
thirdly
I
ask
thee
whats
their
offence
sixth
and
lastly
why
they
are
committed
and
to
conclude
what
you
lay
to
their
charge
Claud
Rightly
reasoned
and
in
his
own
division
and
by
my
troth
theres
one
meaning
well
suited
Pedro
Who
have
you
offended
masters
that
you
are
thus
bound
to
your
answer
This
learned
constable
is
too
cunning
to
be
understood
Whats
your
offence
Bora
Sweet
Prince
let
me
go
no
farther
to
mine
answer
Do
you
hear
me
and
let
this
Count
kill
me
I
have
deceived
even
your
very
eyes
What
your
wisdoms
could
not
discover
these
shallow
fools
have
brought
to
light
who
in
the
night
overheard
me
confessing
to
this
man
how
Don
John
your
brother
incensed
me
to
slander
the
Lady
Hero
how
you
were
brought
into
the
orchard
and
saw
me
court
Margaret
in
Heros
garments
how
you
disgracd
her
when
you
should
marry
her
My
villany
they
have
upon
record
which
I
had
rather
seal
with
my
death
than
repeat
over
to
my
shame
The
lady
is
dead
upon
mine
and
my
masters
false
accusation
and
briefly
I
desire
nothing
but
the
reward
of
a
villain
Pedro
Runs
not
this
speech
like
iron
through
your
blood
Claud
I
have
drunk
poison
whiles
he
utterd
it
Pedro
But
did
my
brother
set
thee
on
to
this
Bora
Yea
and
paid
me
richly
for
the
practice
of
it
Pedro
He
is
composd
and
framd
of
treachery
And
fled
he
is
upon
this
villany
Claud
Sweet
Hero

thy
image
doth
appear
In
the
rare
semblance
that
I
lovd
it
first
Dog
Come

the
plaintiffs
By
this
time
our
sexton
hath
reformed
Signior
Leonato
of
the
matter
And
masters

not
forget
to
specify
when
time
and
place
shall
serve
that
I

an
ass
Verg
Here

Enter

villain
Let

his
eyes
That
when
I

another
man
like
him
I
may
avoid
him
Which
of
these
is
he
Bora
If
you
would
know
your
wronger
look
on
me
Leon
Art

Mine

Record

worthy
deeds
Twas
bravely
done
if
you
bethink
you
of
it
Claud
I
know
not
how
to
pray
your
patience
Yet
I
must
speak
Choose
your
revenge
yourself
Impose
me
to
what
penance
your
invention
Can
lay
upon
my
sin
Yet
sinnd
I
not
But
in
mistaking
Pedro
By
my
soul
nor
I
And
yet
to
satisfy
this
good
old
man
I
would
bend
under
any
heavy
weight
That
hell
enjoin
me
to
Leon
I
cannot
bid
you
bid
my
daughter
live
That
were
impossible
but
I
pray
you
both
Possess
the
people
in
Messina
here
How
innocent
she
died
and
if
your
love
Can
labour
aught
in
sad
invention
Hang
her
an
epitaph
upon
her
tomb
And
sing
it
to
her

Tomorrow

Almost

Give

wrong
Hird
to

your
brother
Bora
No
by
my
soul
she
was
not
Nor
knew
not
what
she
did
when

spoke
to
me
But
always
hath
been
just

virtuous
In

Deformed
They
say
he
wears
a
key
in
his
ear
and
a
lock
hanging
by
it
and
borrows
money
in
Gods
name
the
which
he
hath
usd
so
long
and
never
paid
that
now
men
grow
hardhearted
and
will
lend
nothing
for
Gods
sake
Pray

upon
that
point

blunt

fencers
foils
which

hurt
not
Bene
most
manly

Margaret
it
will
not
hurt
a
woman
And
so
I
pray
thee
call
Beatrice
I
give
thee
the
bucklers
Marg
Give
us
the
swords
we
have
bucklers
of
our
own
Bene
If
you
use
them
Margaret
you
must
put
in
the
pikes
with
a
vice
and
they
are
dangerous
weapons
for
maids
Marg
Well
I
will
call
Beatrice
to
you
who
I
think
hath
legs
Bene
And
therefore
will
come
Sings
The
god
of
love
That
sits
above
And
knows
me
and
knows
me
How
pitiful
I
deserve
I
mean
in
singing
but
in
loving
Leander
the
good
swimmer
Troilus
the
first
employer
of
panders
and
a
whole
book
full
of
these
quondam
carpetmongers
whose
names
yet
run
smoothly
in
the
even
road
of
a
blank
versewhy
they
were
never
so
truly
turnd
over
and
over
as
my
poor
self
in
love
Marry
I
cannot
show
it
in
rhyme
I
have
tried
I
can
find
out
no
rhyme
to
lady
but
baby
an
innocent
rhyme
for
scorn
horna
hard
rhyme
for
school
foola
babbling
rhyme
very
ominous
endings
No
I
was
not
born
under
a
rhyming
planet
nor
cannot
woo
in
festival
terms
Enter
Beatrice
Sweet
Beatrice
wouldst
thou
come
when
I
calld
thee
Beat
Yea
signior
and
depart
when
you
bid
me
Bene
stay
but
till
then
Beat
Then
is
spoken
Fare
you
well
now
And
yet
ere
I
go
let
me
go
with
that
I
came
for
which
is
with
knowing
what
hath
passd
between
you
and
Claudio
Bene
Only
foul
words
and
thereupon
I
will
kiss
thee
Beat
Foul
words
is
but
foul
wind
and
foul
wind
is
but
foul
breath
and
foul
breath
is
noisome
Therefore
I
will
depart
unkissd
Bene
Thou
hast
frighted
the
word
out
of
his
right
sense
so
forcible
is
thy
wit
But
I
must
tell
thee
plainly
Claudio
undergoes
my
challenge
and
either
I
must
shortly
hear
from
him
or
I
will
subscribe
him
a
coward
And
I
pray
thee
now
tell
me
for
which
of
my
bad
parts
didst
thou
first
fall
in
love
with
me
Beat
For
them
all
together
which
maintaind
so
politic
a
state
of
evil
that
they
will
not
admit
any
good
part
to
intermingle
with
them
But
for
which
of
my
good
parts
did
you
first
suffer
love
for
me
Bene
Suffer
lovea
good
epithet
I
do
suffer
love
indeed
for
I
love
thee
against
my
will
Beat
In
spite
of
your
heart
I
think
Alas
poor
heart
If
you
spite
it
for
my
sake
I
will
spite
it
for
yours
for
I
will
never
love
that
which
my
friend
hates
Bene
Thou
and
I
are
too
wise
to
woo
peaceably
Beat
It
appears
not
in
this
confession
Theres
not
one
wise
man
among
twenty
that
will
praise
himself
Bene
An
old
an
old
instance
Beatrice
that
livd
in
the
time
of
good
neighbours
If
a
man
do
not
erect
in
this
age
his
own
tomb
ere
he
dies
he
shall
live
no
longer
in
monument
than
the
bell
rings
and
the
widow
weeps
Beat
And
how
long
is
that
think
you
Bene
Question
why
an
hour
in
clamour
and
a
quarter
in
rheum
Therefore
is
it
most
expedient
for
the
wise
if
Don
Worm
his
conscience
find
no
impediment
to
the
contrary
to
be
the
trumpet
of
his
own
virtues
as
I
am
to
myself
So
much
for
praising
myself
who
I
myself
will
bear
witness
is
praiseworthy
And
now
tell
me
how
doth
your
cousin
Beat
Very
ill
Bene
And
how
do
you
Beat
Very
ill
too
Bene
Serve
God
love
me

mend

will
I

you

Do

Why

your

the
Prince

Claudio
Have
been
deceived
for
they
swore
you
did
Beat
Do
not
you
love

Bene
Troth

more
than
reason
Beat
Why
then
my

Ursula
Are

deceivd

swear
you
did
Bene
They
swore
that
you
were
almost
sick
for
me
Beat
They
swore
that
you
were
wellnigh
dead
for
me
Bene
Tis
no
such
matter
Then
you
do
not
love
me
Beat
No
truly
but
in
friendly
recompense
Leon
Come
cousin
I
am
sure
you
love
the
gentleman
Claud
And
Ill
be
sworn
upont
that
he
loves
her
For
heres
a
paper
written
in
his
hand
halting
sonnet
of
his
own
pure
brain
Fashiond

unto
Benedick

miracle
Heres
our
own
hands
against
our
hearts
Come
I
will
have
thee
but
by
this
light
I
take
thee
for
pity
Beat
I
would
not
deny
you
but
by
this
good
day
I
yield
upon
great
persuasion
and
partly
to
save
your
life
for
I
was
told
you
were
in
a
consumption
Bene
Peace
I
will
stop
your
mouth
Kisses
her
Beat
Ill
tell
thee
what
Prince
a
college
of
witcrackers
cannot
flout
me
out
of
my
humour
Dost
thou
think
I
care
for
a
satire
or
an
epigram
No
If
a
man
will
be
beaten
with
brains
a
shall
wear
nothing
handsome
about
him
In
brief
since
I
do
purpose
to
marry
I
will
think
nothing
to
any
purpose
that
the
world
can
say
against
it
and
therefore
never
flout
at
me
for
what
I
have
said
against
it
for
man
is
a
giddy
thing
and
this
is
my
conclusion
For
thy
part
Claudio
I
did
think
to
have
beaten
thee
but
in
that
thou
art
like
to
be
my
kinsman
live
unbruisd
and
love
my
cousin
Claud
I
had
well
hopd
thou
wouldst
have
denied
Beatrice
that
I
might
have
cudgelld
thee
out
of
thy
single
life
to
make
thee
a
doubledealer
which
out
of
question
thou
wilt
be
if
my
cousin
do
not
look
exceeding
narrowly
to
thee
Bene
Come
come
we
are
friends
Lets
have
a
dance
ere
we
are
married
that
we
may
lighten
our
own
hearts
and
our
wives
heels
Leon
Well
have
dancing
afterward
Bene
First
of
my
word
Therefore
play
music
Prince
thou
art
sad
Get
thee
a
wife
get
thee
a
wife
There
is
no
staff
more
reverent
than
one
tippd
with
horn
Enter
Messenger
Mess
My
lord
your
brother
John

taen
in
flight
And
brought
with
armed

Think
not
on
him
till
tomorrow
Ill
devise
thee
brave
punishments
for
him
Strike
up
pipers
Dance
I
I
Venice
street
Enter
Roderigo
and
Iago
Tush
never
tell
me
I
take
it
much
unkindly
That
thou
Iago
who
hast
had
my
purse
As
if
the
strings
were
thine
shouldst
know
of
this
Sblood
but
you
will
not
hear
me
If
ever
I
did
dream
of
such
a
matter
Abhor
me
Thou
toldst
me
thou
didst
hold
him
in
thy
hate
Despise
me
if
I
do
not
Three
great
ones
of
the
city
In
personal
suit
to
make
me
his
lieutenant
Offcappd
to
him
and
by
the
faith
of
man
I
know
my
price
I
am
worth
no
worse
a
place
But
he
as
loving
his
own
pride
and
purposes
Evades
them
with
a
bumbast
circumstance
Horribly
stuffd
with
epithets
of
war
And
in
conclusion
Nonsuits
my
mediators
for
Certes
says
he
I
have
already
chose
my
officer
And
what
was
he
Forsooth
a
great
arithmetician
One
Michael
Cassio
a
Florentine
fellow
almost
damnd
in
a
fair
wife
That
never
set
a
squadron
in
the
field
Nor
the
division
of
a
battle
knows
More
than
a
spinster
unless
the
bookish
theoric
Wherein
the
toged
consuls
can
propose
As
masterly
as
he
Mere
prattle
without
practice
Is
all
his
soldiership
But
he
sir
had
the
election
And
I
of
whom
his
eyes
had
seen
the
proof
At
Rhodes
at
Cyprus
and
on
other
grounds
Christian
and
heathen
must
be
beleed
and
calmd
By
debitor
and
creditor
This
countercaster
He
in
good
time
must
his
lieutenant
be
And
I
God
bless
the
mark
his
Moorships
ancient
By
heaven
I
rather
would
have
been
his
hangman
Why
theres
no
remedy
Tis
the
curse
of
service
Preferment
goes
by
letter
and
affection
And
not
by
old
gradation
where
each
second
Stood
heir
to
the
first
Now
sir
be
judge
yourself
Whether
I
in
any
just
term
am
affined
To
love
the
Moor
I
would
not
follow
him
then
sir
content
you
I
follow
him
to
serve
my
turn
upon
him
We
cannot
all
be
masters
nor
all
masters
Cannot
be
truly
followd
You
shall
mark
Many
a
duteous
and
kneecrooking
knave
That
doting
on
his
own
obsequious
bondage
Wears
out
his
time
much
like
his
masters
ass
For
nought
but
provender
and
when
hes
old
cashierd
Whip
me
such
honest
knaves
Others
there
are
Who
trimmd
in
forms
and
visages
of
duty
Keep
yet
their
hearts
attending
on
themselves
And
throwing
but
shows
of
service
on
their
lords
Do
well
thrive
by
them
and
when
they
have
lined
their
coats
Do
themselves
homage
These
fellows
have
some
soul
And
such
a
one
do
I
profess
myself
For
sir
It
is
as
sure
as
you
are
Roderigo
Were
I
the
Moor
I
would
not
be
Iago
In
following
him
I
follow
but
myself
Heaven
is
my
judge
not
I
for
love
and
duty
But
seeming
so
for
my
peculiar
end
For
when
my
outward
action
doth
demonstrate
The
native
act
and
figure
of
my
heart
In
complement
extern
tis
not
long
after
But
I
will
wear
my
heart
upon
my
sleeve
For
daws
to
peck
at
I
am
not
what
I
am
What
a
full
fortune
does
the
thicklips
owe
If
he
can
carryt
thus
Call
up
her
father
Rouse
him
make
after
him
poison
his
delight
Proclaim
him
in
the
streets
incense
her
kinsmen
And
though
he
in
a
fertile
climate
dwell
Plague
him
with
flies
Though
that
his
joy
be
joy
Yet
throw
such
changes
of
vexation
ont
As
it
may
lose
some
color
Here
is
her
fathers
house
Ill
call
aloud
Do
with
like
timorous
accent
and
dire
yell
As
when
by
night
and
negligence
the
fire
Is
spied
in
populous
cities
What
ho
Brabantio
Signior
Brabantio
ho
Awake
What
ho
Brabantio
Thieves
Thieves
Thieves
Look
to
your
house
your
daughter
and
your
bags
Thieves
Thieves
Brabantio
appears
above
at
a
window
What
is
the
reason
of
this
terrible
summons
What
is
the
matter
there
Signior
is
all
your
family
within
Are
your
doors
lockd
Why
Wherefore
ask
you
this
Zounds
sir
youre
robbd
For
shame
put
on
your
gown
Your
heart
is
burst
you
have
lost
half
your
soul
Even
now
now
very
now
an
old
black
ram
Is
tupping
your
white
ewe
Arise
arise
Awake
the
snorting
citizens
with
the
bell
Or
else
the
devil
will
make
a
grandsire
of
you
Arise
I
say
What
have
you
lost
your
wits
Most
reverend
signior
do
you
know
my
voice
Not
I
What
are
you
My
name
is
Roderigo
The
worser
welcome
I
have
charged
thee
not
to
haunt
about
my
doors
In
honest
plainness
thou
hast
heard
me
say
My
daughter
is
not
for
thee
and
now
in
madness
Being
full
of
supper
and
distempering
draughts
Upon
malicious
bravery
dost
thou
come
To
start
my
quiet
Sir
sir
sir
But
thou
must
needs
be
sure
My
spirit
and
my
place
have
in
them
power
To
make
this
bitter
to
thee
Patience
good
sir
What
tellst
thou
me
of
robbing
This
is
Venice
My
house
is
not
a
grange
Most
grave
Brabantio
In
simple
and
pure
soul
I
come
to
you
Zounds
sir
you
are
one
of
those
that
will
not
serve
God
if
the
devil
bid
you
Because
we
come
to
do
you
service
and
you
think
we
are
ruffians
youll
have
your
daughter
covered
with
a
Barbary
horse
youll
have
your
nephews
neigh
to
you
youll
have
coursers
for
cousins
and
gennets
for
germans
What
profane
wretch
art
thou
I
am
one
sir
that
comes
to
tell
you
your
daughter
and
the
Moor
are
now
making
the
beast
with
two
backs
Thou
are
a
villain
You
are
a
senator
This
thou
shalt
answer
I
know
thee
Roderigo
Sir
I
will
answer
anything
But
I
beseech
you
Ift
be
your
pleasure
and
most
wise
consent
As
partly
I
find
it
is
that
your
fair
daughter
At
this
oddeven
and
dull
watch
o
the
night
Transported
with
no
worse
nor
better
guard
But
with
a
knave
of
common
hire
a
gondolier
To
the
gross
clasps
of
a
lascivious
Moor
If
this
be
known
to
you
and
your
allowance
We
then
have
done
you
bold
and
saucy
wrongs
But
if
you
know
not
this
my
manners
tell
me
We
have
your
wrong
rebuke
Do
not
believe
That
from
the
sense
of
all
civility
I
thus
would
play
and
trifle
with
your
reverence
Your
daughter
if
you
have
not
given
her
leave
I
say
again
hath
made
a
gross
revolt
Tying
her
duty
beauty
wit
and
fortunes
In
an
extravagant
and
wheeling
stranger
Of
here
and
everywhere
Straight
satisfy
yourself
If
she
be
in
her
chamber
or
your
house
Let
loose
on
me
the
justice
of
the
state
For
thus
deluding
you
Strike
on
the
tinder
ho
Give
me
a
taper
Call
up
all
my
people
This
accident
is
not
unlike
my
dream
Belief
of
it
oppresses
me
already
Light
I
say
light
Farewell
for
I
must
leave
you
It
seems
not
meet
nor
wholesome
to
my
place
To
be
produced
as
if
I
stay
I
shall
Against
the
Moor
for
I
do
know
the
state
However
this
may
gall
him
with
some
check
Cannot
with
safety
cast
him
for
hes
embarkd
With
such
loud
reason
to
the
Cyprus
wars
Which
even
now
stands
in
act
that
for
their
souls
Another
of
his
fathom
they
have
none
To
lead
their
business
in
which
regard
Though
I
do
hate
him
as
I
do
hell
pains
Yet
for
necessity
of
present
life
I
must
show
out
a
flag
and
sign
of
love
Which
is
indeed
but
sign
That
you
shall
surely
find
him
Lead
to
the
Sagittary
the
raised
search
And
there
will
I
be
with
him
So
farewell
Enter
below
Brabantio
in
his
nightgown
and
Servants
with
torches
It
is
too
true
an
evil
gone
she
is
And
whats
to
come
of
my
despised
time
Is
nought
but
bitterness
Now
Roderigo
Where
didst
thou
see
her
unhappy
girl
With
the
Moor
sayst
thou
Who
would
be
a
father
How
didst
thou
know
twas
she
she
deceives
me
Past
thought
What
said
she
to
you
Get
more
tapers
Raise
all
my
kindred
Are
they
married
think
you
Truly
I
think
they
are
heaven
How
got
she
out
treason
of
the
blood
Fathers
from
hence
trust
not
your
daughters
minds
By
what
you
see
them
act
Is
there
not
charms
By
which
the
property
of
youth
and
maidhood
May
be
abused
Have
you
not
read
Roderigo
Of
some
such
thing
Yes
sir
I
have
indeed
Call
up
my
brother
would
you
had
had
her
Some
one
way
some
another
Do
you
know
Where
we
may
apprehend
her
and
the
Moor
I
think
I
can
discover
him
if
you
please
To
get
good
guard
and
go
along
with
me
Pray
you
lead
on
At
every
house
Ill
call
I
may
command
at
most
Get
weapons
ho
And
raise
some
special
officers
of
night
On
good
Roderigo
Ill
deserve
your
pains
council
chamber
The
Duke
and
Senators
sitting
at
a
table
Officers
attending
There
is
no
composition
in
these
news
That
gives
them
credit
Indeed
they
are
disproportiond
My
letters
say
a
hundred
and
seven
galleys
And
mine
a
hundred
and
forty
And
mine
two
hundred
But
though
they
jump
not
on
a
just
account
As
in
these
cases
where
the
aim
reports
Tis
oft
with
difference
yet
do
they
all
confirm
Turkish
fleet
and
bearing
up
to
Cyprus
Nay
it
is
possible
enough
to
judgement
I
do
not
so
secure
me
in
the
error
But
the
main
article
I
do
approve
In
fearful
sense
Within
What
ho
What
ho
What
ho
messenger
from
the
galleys
Enter
Sailor
Now
whats
the
business
The
Turkish
preparation
makes
for
Rhodes
So
was
I
bid
report
here
to
the
state
By
Signior
Angelo
How
say
you
by
this
change
This
cannot
be
By
no
assay
of
reason
tis
a
pageant
To
keep
us
in
false
gaze
When
we
consider
The
importancy
of
Cyprus
to
the
Turk
And
let
ourselves
again
but
understand
That
as
it
more
concerns
the
Turk
than
Rhodes
So
may
he
with
more
facile
question
bear
it
For
that
it
stands
not
in
such
warlike
brace
But
altogether
lacks
the
abilities
That
Rhodes
is
dressd
in
If
we
make
thought
of
this
We
must
not
think
the
Turk
is
so
unskillful
To
leave
that
latest
which
concerns
him
first
Neglecting
an
attempt
of
ease
and
gain
To
wake
and
wage
a
danger
profitless
Nay
in
all
confidence
hes
not
for
Rhodes
Here
is
more
news
Enter
a
Messenger
The
Ottomites
reverend
and
gracious
Steering
with
due
course
toward
the
isle
of
Rhodes
Have
there
injointed
them
with
an
after
fleet
Ay
so
I
thought
How
many
as
you
guess
Of
thirty
sail
and
now
they
do
restem
Their
backward
course
bearing
with
frank
appearance
Their
purposes
toward
Cyprus
Signior
Montano
Your
trusty
and
most
valiant
servitor
With
his
free
duty
recommends
you
thus
And
prays
you
to
believe
him
Tis
certain
then
for
Cyprus
Marcus
Luccicos
is
not
he
in
town
Hes
now
in
Florence
Write
from
us
to
him
postposthaste
dispatch
Here
comes
Brabantio
and
the
valiant
Moor
Enter
Brabantio
Othello
Iago
Roderigo
and
Officers
Valiant
Othello
we
must
straight
employ
you
Against
the
general
enemy
Ottoman
To
Brabantio
I
did
not
see
you
welcome
gentle
signior
We
lackd
your
counsel
and
your
help
tonight
So
did
I
yours
Good
your
Grace
pardon
me
Neither
my
place
nor
aught
I
heard
of
business
Hath
raised
me
from
my
bed
nor
doth
the
general
care
Take
hold
on
me
for
my
particular
grief
Is
of
so
floodgate
and
oerbearing
nature
That
it
engluts
and
swallows
other
sorrows
And
it
is
still
itself
Why
whats
the
matter
My
daughter
my
daughter
Dead
Ay
to
me
She
is
abused
stoln
from
me
and
corrupted
By
spells
and
medicines
bought
of
mountebanks
For
nature
so
preposterously
to
err
Being
not
deficient
blind
or
lame
of
sense
Sans
witchcraft
could
not
Whoeer
he
be
that
in
this
foul
proceeding
Hath
thus
beguiled
your
daughter
of
herself
And
you
of
her
the
bloody
book
of
law
You
shall
yourself
read
in
the
bitter
letter
After
your
own
sense
yea
though
our
proper
son
Stood
in
your
action
Humbly
I
thank
your
Grace
Here
is
the
man
this
Moor
whom
now
it
seems
Your
special
mandate
for
the
state
affairs
Hath
hither
brought
We
are
very
sorry
fort
To
Othello
What
in
your
own
part
can
you
say
to
this
Nothing
but
this
is
so
Most
potent
grave
and
reverend
signiors
My
very
noble
and
approved
good
masters
That
I
have
taen
away
this
old
mans
daughter
It
is
most
true
true
I
have
married
her
The
very
head
and
front
of
my
offending
Hath
this
extent
no
more
Rude
am
I
in
my
speech
And
little
blest
with
the
soft
phrase
of
peace
For
since
these
arms
of
mine
had
seven
years
pith
Till
now
some
nine
moons
wasted
they
have
used
Their
dearest
action
in
the
tented
field
And
little
of
this
great
world
can
I
speak
More
than
pertains
to
feats
of
broil
and
battle
And
therefore
little
shall
I
grace
my
cause
In
speaking
for
myself
Yet
by
your
gracious
patience
I
will
a
round
unvarnishd
tale
deliver
Of
my
whole
course
of
love
what
drugs
what
charms
What
conjuration
and
what
mighty
magic
For
such
proceeding
I
am
charged
withal
I
won
his
daughter
maiden
never
bold
Of
spirit
so
still
and
quiet
that
her
motion
Blushd
at
herself
and
she
in
spite
of
nature
Of
years
of
country
credit
everything
To
fall
in
love
with
what
she
feard
to
look
on
It
is
judgement
maimd
and
most
imperfect
That
will
confess
perfection
so
could
err
Against
all
rules
of
nature
and
must
be
driven
To
find
out
practices
of
cunning
hell
Why
this
should
be
I
therefore
vouch
again
That
with
some
mixtures
powerful
oer
the
blood
Or
with
some
dram
conjured
to
this
effect
He
wrought
upon
her
To
vouch
this
is
no
proof
Without
more
certain
and
more
overt
test
Than
these
thin
habits
and
poor
likelihoods
Of
modern
seeming
do
prefer
against
him
But
Othello
speak
Did
you
by
indirect
and
forced
courses
Subdue
and
poison
this
young
maids
affections
Or
came
it
by
request
and
such
fair
question
As
soul
to
soul
affordeth
I
do
beseech
you
Send
for
the
lady
to
the
Sagittary
And
let
her
speak
of
me
before
her
father
If
you
do
find
me
foul
in
her
report
The
trust
the
office
I
do
hold
of
you
Not
only
take
away
but
let
your
sentence
Even
fall
upon
my
life
Fetch
Desdemona
hither
Ancient
conduct
them
you
best
know
the
place
And
till
she
come
as
truly
as
to
heaven
I
do
confess
the
vices
of
my
blood
So
justly
to
your
grave
ears
Ill
present
How
I
did
thrive
in
this
fair
ladys
love
And
she
in
mine
Say
it
Othello
Her
father
loved
me
oft
invited
me
Still
questiond
me
the
story
of
my
life
From
year
to
year
the
battles
sieges
fortunes
That
I
have
passd
I
ran
it
through
even
from
my
boyish
days
To
the
very
moment
that
he
bade
me
tell
it
Wherein
I
spake
of
most
disastrous
chances
Of
moving
accidents
by
flood
and
field
Of
hairbreadth
scapes
i
the
imminent
deadly
breach
Of
being
taken
by
the
insolent
foe
And
sold
to
slavery
of
my
redemption
thence
And
portance
in
my
travels
history
Wherein
of
antres
vast
and
deserts
idle
Rough
quarries
rocks
and
hills
whose
heads
touch
heaven
It
was
my
hint
to
speak
such
was
the
process
And
of
the
Cannibals
that
each
other
eat
The
Anthropophagi
and
men
whose
heads
Do
grow
beneath
their
shoulders
This
to
hear
Would
Desdemona
seriously
incline
But
still
the
house
affairs
would
draw
her
thence
Which
ever
as
she
could
with
haste
dispatch
Sheld
come
again
and
with
a
greedy
ear
Devour
up
my
discourse
which
I
observing
Took
once
a
pliant
hour
and
found
good
means
To
draw
from
her
a
prayer
of
earnest
heart
That
I
would
all
my
pilgrimage
dilate
Whereof
by
parcels
she
had
something
heard
But
not
intentively
I
did
consent
And
often
did
beguile
her
of
her
tears
When
I
did
speak
of
some
distressful
stroke
That
my
youth
sufferd
My
story
being
done
She
gave
me
for
my
pains
a
world
of
sighs
She
swore
in
faith
twas
strange
twas
passing
strange
Twas
pitiful
twas
wondrous
pitiful
She
wishd
she
had
not
heard
it
yet
she
wishd
That
heaven
had
made
her
such
a
man
she
thankd
me
And
bade
me
if
I
had
a
friend
that
loved
her
I
should
but
teach
him
how
to
tell
my
story
And
that
would
woo
her
Upon
this
hint
I
spake
She
loved
me
for
the
dangers
I
had
passd
And
I
loved
her
that
she
did
pity
them
This
only
is
the
witchcraft
I
have
used
Here
comes
the
lady
let
her
witness
it
Enter
Desdemona
Iago
and
Attendants
I
think
this
tale
would
win
my
daughter
too
Good
Brabantio
Take
up
this
mangled
matter
at
the
best
Men
do
their
broken
weapons
rather
use
Than
their
bare
hands
I
pray
you
hear
her
speak
If
she
confess
that
she
was
half
the
wooer
Destruction
on
my
head
if
my
bad
blame
Light
on
the
man
Come
hither
gentle
mistress
Do
you
perceive
in
all
this
noble
company
Where
most
you
owe
obedience
My
noble
father
I
do
perceive
here
a
divided
duty
To
you
I
am
bound
for
life
and
education
My
life
and
education
both
do
learn
me
How
to
respect
you
you
are
the
lord
of
duty
I
am
hitherto
your
daughter
But
heres
my
husband
And
so
much
duty
as
my
mother
showd
To
you
preferring
you
before
her
father
So
much
I
challenge
that
I
may
profess
Due
to
the
Moor
my
lord
God
be
with
you
I
have
done
Please
it
your
Grace
on
to
the
state
affairs
I
had
rather
to
adopt
a
child
than
get
it
Come
hither
Moor
I
here
do
give
thee
that
with
all
my
heart
Which
but
thou
hast
already
with
all
my
heart
I
would
keep
from
thee
For
your
sake
jewel
I
am
glad
at
soul
I
have
no
other
child
For
thy
escape
would
teach
me
tyranny
To
hang
clogs
on
them
I
have
done
my
lord
Let
me
speak
like
yourself
and
lay
a
sentence
Which
as
a
grise
or
step
may
help
these
lovers
Into
your
favor
When
remedies
are
past
the
griefs
are
ended
By
seeing
the
worst
which
late
on
hopes
depended
To
mourn
a
mischief
that
is
past
and
gone
Is
the
next
way
to
draw
new
mischief
on
What
cannot
be
preserved
when
Fortune
takes
Patience
her
injury
a
mockery
makes
The
robbd
that
smiles
steals
something
from
the
thief
He
robs
himself
that
spends
a
bootless
grief
So
let
the
Turk
of
Cyprus
us
beguile
We
lose
it
not
so
long
as
we
can
smile
He
bears
the
sentence
well
that
nothing
bears
But
the
free
comfort
which
from
thence
he
hears
But
he
bears
both
the
sentence
and
the
sorrow
That
to
pay
grief
must
of
poor
patience
borrow
These
sentences
to
sugar
or
to
gall
Being
strong
on
both
sides
are
equivocal
But
words
are
words
I
never
yet
did
hear
That
the
bruised
heart
was
pierced
through
the
ear
I
humbly
beseech
you
proceed
to
the
affairs
of
state
The
Turk
with
a
most
mighty
preparation
makes
for
Cyprus
Othello
the
fortitude
of
the
place
is
best
known
to
you
and
though
we
have
there
a
substitute
of
most
allowed
sufficiency
yet
opinion
a
sovereign
mistress
of
effects
throws
a
more
safer
voice
on
you
You
must
therefore
be
content
to
slubber
the
gloss
of
your
new
fortunes
with
this
more
stubborn
and
boisterous
expedition
The
tyrant
custom
most
grave
senators
Hath
made
the
flinty
and
steel
couch
of
war
My
thricedriven
bed
of
down
I
do
agnize
natural
and
prompt
alacrity
I
find
in
hardness
and
do
undertake
These
present
wars
against
the
Ottomites
Most
humbly
therefore
bending
to
your
state
I
crave
fit
disposition
for
my
wife
Due
reference
of
place
and
exhibition
With
such
accommodation
and
besort
As
levels
with
her
breeding
If
you
please
Bet
at
her
fathers
Ill
not
have
it
so
Nor
I
Nor
I
I
would
not
there
reside
To
put
my
father
in
impatient
thoughts
By
being
in
his
eye
Most
gracious
Duke
To
my
unfolding
lend
your
prosperous
ear
And
let
me
find
a
charter
in
your
voice
To
assist
my
simpleness
What
would
you
Desdemona
That
I
did
love
the
Moor
to
live
with
him
My
downright
violence
and
storm
of
fortunes
May
trumpet
to
the
world
My
hearts
subdued
Even
to
the
very
quality
of
my
lord
I
saw
Othellos
visage
in
his
mind
And
to
his
honors
and
his
valiant
parts
Did
I
my
soul
and
fortunes
consecrate
So
that
dear
lords
if
I
be
left
behind
moth
of
peace
and
he
go
to
the
war
The
rites
for
which
I
love
him
are
bereft
me
And
I
a
heavy
interim
shall
support
By
his
dear
absence
Let
me
go
with
him
Let
her
have
your
voices
Vouch
with
me
heaven
I
therefore
beg
it
not
To
please
the
palate
of
my
appetite
Nor
to
comply
with
heat
the
young
affects
In
me
defunct
and
proper
satisfaction
But
to
be
free
and
bounteous
to
her
mind
And
heaven
defend
your
good
souls
that
you
think
I
will
your
serious
and
great
business
scant
For
she
is
with
me
No
when
lightwingd
toys
Of
featherd
Cupid
seel
with
wanton
dullness
My
speculative
and
officed
instruments
That
my
disports
corrupt
and
taint
my
business
Let
housewives
make
a
skillet
of
my
helm
And
all
indign
and
base
adversities
Make
head
against
my
estimation
Be
it
as
you
shall
privately
determine
Either
for
her
stay
or
going
The
affair
cries
haste
And
speed
must
answert
you
must
hence
tonight
Tonight
my
lord
This
night
With
all
my
heart
At
nine
i
the
morning
here
well
meet
again
Othello
leave
some
officer
behind
And
he
shall
our
commission
bring
to
you
With
such
things
else
of
quality
and
respect
As
doth
import
you
So
please
your
Grace
my
ancient
man
he
is
of
honesty
and
trust
To
his
conveyance
I
assign
my
wife
With
what
else
needful
your
good
Grace
shall
think
To
be
sent
after
me
Let
it
be
so
Good
night
to
everyone
To
Brabantio
And
noble
signior
If
virtue
no
delighted
beauty
lack
Your
soninlaw
is
far
more
fair
than
black
Adieu
brave
Moor
use
Desdemona
well
Look
to
her
Moor
if
thou
hast
eyes
to
see
She
has
deceived
her
father
and
may
thee
My
life
upon
her
faith
Honest
Iago
My
Desdemona
must
I
leave
to
thee
I
prithee
let
thy
wife
attend
on
her
And
bring
them
after
in
the
best
advantage
Come
Desdemona
I
have
but
an
hour
Of
love
of
worldly
matters
and
direction
To
spend
with
thee
We
must
obey
the
time
Iago
What
sayst
thou
noble
heart
What
will
I
do
thinkest
thou
Why
go
to
bed
and
sleep
I
will
incontinently
drown
myself
If
thou
dost
I
shall
never
love
thee
after
Why
thou
silly
gentleman
It
is
silliness
to
live
when
to
live
is
torment
and
then
have
we
a
prescription
to
die
when
death
is
our
physician
villainous
I
have
looked
upon
the
world
for
four
times
seven
years
and
since
I
could
distinguish
betwixt
a
benefit
and
an
injury
I
never
found
man
that
knew
how
to
love
himself
Ere
I
would
say
I
would
drown
myself
for
the
love
of
a
guinea
hen
I
would
change
my
humanity
with
a
baboon
What
should
I
do
I
confess
it
is
my
shame
to
be
so
fond
but
it
is
not
in
my
virtue
to
amend
it
Virtue
a
fig
Tis
in
ourselves
that
we
are
thus
or
thus
Our
bodies
are
gardens
to
the
which
our
wills
are
gardeners
so
that
if
we
will
plant
nettles
or
sow
lettuce
set
hyssop
and
weed
up
thyme
supply
it
with
one
gender
of
herbs
or
distract
it
with
many
either
to
have
it
sterile
with
idleness
or
manured
with
industry
why
the
power
and
corrigible
authority
of
this
lies
in
our
wills
If
the
balance
of
our
lives
had
not
one
scale
of
reason
to
poise
another
of
sensuality
the
blood
and
baseness
of
our
natures
would
conduct
us
to
most
preposterous
conclusions
But
we
have
reason
to
cool
our
raging
motions
our
carnal
stings
our
unbitted
lusts
whereof
I
take
this
that
you
call
love
to
be
a
sect
or
scion
It
cannot
be
It
is
merely
a
lust
of
the
blood
and
a
permission
of
the
will
Come
be
a
man
Drown
thyself
Drown
cats
and
blind
puppies
I
have
professed
me
thy
friend
and
I
confess
me
knit
to
thy
deserving
with
cables
of
perdurable
toughness
I
could
never
better
stead
thee
than
now
Put
money
in
thy
purse
follow
thou
the
wars
defeat
thy
favor
with
an
usurped
beard
I
say
put
money
in
thy
purse
It
cannot
be
that
Desdemona
should
long
continue
her
love
to
the
Moor
put
money
in
thy
purse
nor
he
his
to
her
It
was
a
violent
commencement
and
thou
shalt
see
an
answerable
sequestration
put
but
money
in
thy
purse
These
Moors
are
changeable
in
their
wills
fill
thy
purse
with
money
The
food
that
to
him
now
is
as
luscious
as
locusts
shall
be
to
him
shortly
as
acerb
as
the
coloquintida
She
must
change
for
youth
when
she
is
sated
with
his
body
she
will
find
the
error
of
her
choice
She
must
have
change
she
must
therefore
put
money
in
thy
purse
If
thou
wilt
needs
damn
thyself
do
it
a
more
delicate
way
than
drowning
Make
all
the
money
thou
canst
If
sanctimony
and
a
frail
vow
betwixt
an
erring
barbarian
and
a
supersubtle
Venetian
be
not
too
hard
for
my
wits
and
all
the
tribe
of
hell
thou
shalt
enjoy
her
therefore
make
money
pox
of
drowning
thyself
It
is
clean
out
of
the
way
Seek
thou
rather
to
be
hanged
in
compassing
thy
joy
than
to
be
drowned
and
go
without
her
Wilt
thou
be
fast
to
my
hopes
if
I
depend
on
the
issue
Thou
art
sure
of
me
go
make
money
I
have
told
thee
often
and
I
retell
thee
again
and
again
I
hate
the
Moor
My
cause
is
hearted
thine
hath
no
less
reason
Let
us
be
conjunctive
in
our
revenge
against
him
If
thou
canst
cuckold
him
thou
dost
thyself
a
pleasure
me
a
sport
There
are
many
events
in
the
womb
of
time
which
will
be
delivered
Traverse
go
provide
thy
money
We
will
have
more
of
this
tomorrow
Adieu
Where
shall
we
meet
i
the
morning
At
my
lodging
Ill
be
with
thee
betimes
Go
to
farewell
Do
you
hear
Roderigo
What
say
you
No
more
of
drowning
do
you
hear
I
am
changed
Ill
go
sell
all
my
land
Thus
do
I
ever
make
my
fool
my
purse
For
I
mine
own
gaind
knowledge
should
profane
If
I
would
time
expend
with
such
a
snipe
But
for
my
sport
and
profit
I
hate
the
Moor
And
it
is
thought
abroad
that
twixt
my
sheets
He
has
done
my
office
I
know
not
ift
be
true
But
I
for
mere
suspicion
in
that
kind
Will
do
as
if
for
surety
He
holds
me
well
The
better
shall
my
purpose
work
on
him
Cassios
a
proper
man
Let
me
see
now
To
get
his
place
and
to
plume
up
my
will
In
double
knavery
How
how
Lets
see
After
some
time
to
abuse
Othellos
ear
That
he
is
too
familiar
with
his
wife
He
hath
a
person
and
a
smooth
dispose
To
be
suspected
framed
to
make
women
false
The
Moor
is
of
a
free
and
open
nature
That
thinks
men
honest
that
but
seem
to
be
so
And
will
as
tenderly
be
led
by
the
nose
As
asses
are
I
havet
It
is
engenderd
Hell
and
night
Must
bring
this
monstrous
birth
to
the
worlds
light
I
seaport
in
Cyprus
An
open
place
near
the
quay
Enter
Montano
and
two
Gentlemen
What
from
the
cape
can
you
discern
at
sea
Nothing
at
all
It
is
a
highwrought
flood
I
cannot
twixt
the
heaven
and
the
main
Descry
a
sail
Methinks
the
wind
hath
spoke
aloud
at
land
fuller
blast
neer
shook
our
battlements
If
it
hath
ruffiand
so
upon
the
sea
What
ribs
of
oak
when
mountains
melt
on
them
Can
hold
the
mortise
What
shall
we
hear
of
this
segregation
of
the
Turkish
fleet
For
do
but
stand
upon
the
foaming
shore
The
chidden
billow
seems
to
pelt
the
clouds
The
windshaked
surge
with
high
and
monstrous
mane
Seems
to
cast
water
on
the
burning
bear
And
quench
the
guards
of
the
everfixed
pole
I
never
did
like
molestation
view
On
the
enchafed
flood
If
that
the
Turkish
fleet
Be
not
enshelterd
and
embayd
they
are
drownd
It
is
impossible
to
bear
it
out
Enter
a
third
Gentleman
News
lads
Our
wars
are
done
The
desperate
tempest
hath
so
bangd
the
Turks
That
their
designment
halts
noble
ship
of
Venice
Hath
seen
a
grievous
wreck
and
sufferance
On
most
part
of
their
fleet
How
Is
this
true
The
ship
is
here
put
in
Veronesa
Michael
Cassio
Lieutenant
to
the
warlike
Moor
Othello
Is
come
on
shore
the
Moor
himself
at
sea
And
is
in
full
commission
here
for
Cyprus
I
am
glad
ont
tis
a
worthy
governor
But
this
same
Cassio
though
he
speak
of
comfort
Touching
the
Turkish
loss
yet
he
looks
sadly
And
prays
the
Moor
be
safe
for
they
were
parted
With
foul
and
violent
tempest
Pray
heavens
he
be
For
I
have
served
him
and
the
man
commands
Like
a
full
soldier
Lets
to
the
seaside
ho
As
well
to
see
the
vessel
thats
come
in
As
to
throw
out
our
eyes
for
brave
Othello
Even
till
we
make
the
main
and
the
aerial
blue
An
indistinct
regard
Come
lets
do
so
For
every
minute
is
expectancy
Of
more
arrivance
Enter
Cassio
Thanks
you
the
valiant
of
this
warlike
isle
That
so
approve
the
Moor
let
the
heavens
Give
him
defense
against
the
elements
For
I
have
lost
him
on
a
dangerous
sea
I
she
well
shippd
His
bark
is
stoutly
timberd
and
his
pilot
Of
very
expert
and
approved
allowance
Therefore
my
hopes
not
surfeited
to
death
Stand
in
bold
cure
cry
within
sail
a
sail
a
sail
Enter
a
fourth
Gentleman
What
noise
The
town
is
empty
on
the
brow
o
the
sea
Stand
ranks
of
people
and
they
cry
sail
My
hopes
do
shape
him
for
the
governor
Guns
heard
They
do
discharge
their
shot
of
courtesy
Our
friends
at
least
I
pray
you
sir
go
forth
And
give
us
truth
who
tis
that
is
arrived
I
shall
But
good
lieutenant
is
your
general
wived
Most
fortunately
he
hath
achieved
a
maid
That
paragons
description
and
wild
fame
One
that
excels
the
quirks
of
blazoning
pens
And
in
the
essential
vesture
of
creation
Does
tire
the
ingener
Reenter
second
Gentleman
How
now
who
has
put
in
Tis
one
Iago
ancient
to
the
general
He
has
had
most
favorable
and
happy
speed
Tempests
themselves
high
seas
and
howling
winds
The
gutterd
rocks
and
congregated
sands
Traitors
ensteepd
to
clog
the
guiltless
keel
As
having
sense
of
beauty
do
omit
Their
mortal
natures
letting
go
safely
by
The
divine
Desdemona
What
is
she
She
that
I
spake
of
our
great
captains
captain
Left
in
the
conduct
of
the
bold
Iago
Whose
footing
here
anticipates
our
thoughts
sennights
speed
Great
Jove
Othello
guard
And
swell
his
sail
with
thine
own
powerful
breath
That
he
may
bless
this
bay
with
his
tall
ship
Make
loves
quick
pants
in
Desdemonas
arms
Give
renewd
fire
to
our
extincted
spirits
And
bring
all
Cyprus
comfort
Enter
Desdemona
Emilia
Iago
Roderigo
and
Attendants
behold
The
riches
of
the
ship
is
come
on
shore
Ye
men
of
Cyprus
let
her
have
your
knees
Hall
to
thee
lady
And
the
grace
of
heaven
Before
behind
thee
and
on
every
hand
Enwheel
thee
round
I
thank
you
valiant
Cassio
What
tidings
can
you
tell
me
of
my
lord
He
is
not
yet
arrived
nor
know
I
aught
But
that
hes
well
and
will
be
shortly
here
but
I
fear
How
lost
you
company
The
great
contention
of
the
sea
and
skies
Parted
our
fellowship
But
hark
a
sail
cry
within
sail
a
sail
Guns
heard
They
give
their
greeting
to
the
citadel
This
likewise
is
a
friend
See
for
the
news
Good
ancient
you
are
welcome
To
Emilia
Welcome
mistress
Let
it
not
gall
your
patience
good
Iago
That
I
extend
my
manners
tis
my
breeding
That
gives
me
this
bold
show
of
courtesy
Kisses
her
Sir
would
she
give
you
so
much
of
her
lips
As
of
her
tongue
she
oft
bestows
on
me
Yould
have
enough
Alas
she
has
no
speech
In
faith
too
much
I
find
it
still
when
I
have
list
to
sleep
Marry
before
your
ladyship
I
grant
She
puts
her
tongue
a
little
in
her
heart
And
chides
with
thinking
You
have
little
cause
to
say
so
Come
on
come
on
You
are
pictures
out
of
doors
Bells
in
your
parlors
wildcats
in
your
kitchens
Saints
in
your
injuries
devils
being
offended
Players
in
your
housewifery
and
housewives
in
your
beds
fie
upon
thee
slanderer
Nay
it
is
true
or
else
I
am
a
Turk
You
rise
to
play
and
go
to
bed
to
work
You
shall
not
write
my
praise
No
let
me
not
What
wouldst
thou
write
of
me
if
thou
shouldst
praise
me
gentle
lady
do
not
put
me
tot
For
I
am
nothing
if
not
critical
Come
on
assay
Theres
one
gone
to
the
harbor
Ay
madam
I
am
not
merry
but
I
do
beguile
The
thing
I
am
by
seeming
otherwise
Come
how
wouldst
thou
praise
me
I
am
about
it
but
indeed
my
invention
Comes
from
my
pate
as
birdlime
does
from
frieze
It
plucks
out
brains
and
all
But
my
Muse
labors
And
thus
she
is
deliverd
If
she
be
fair
and
wise
fairness
and
wit
The
ones
for
use
the
other
useth
it
Well
praised
How
if
she
be
black
and
witty
If
she
be
black
and
thereto
have
a
wit
Shell
find
a
white
that
shall
her
blackness
fit
Worse
and
worse
How
if
fair
and
foolish
She
never
yet
was
foolish
that
was
fair
For
even
her
folly
helpd
her
to
an
heir
These
are
old
fond
paradoxes
to
make
fools
laugh
i
the
alehouse
What
miserable
praise
hast
thou
for
her
thats
foul
and
foolish
Theres
none
so
foul
and
foolish
thereunto
But
does
foul
pranks
which
fair
and
wise
ones
do
heavy
ignorance
Thou
praisest
the
worst
best
But
what
praise
couldst
thou
bestow
on
a
deserving
woman
indeed
one
that
in
the
authority
of
her
merit
did
justly
put
on
the
vouch
of
very
malice
itself
She
that
was
ever
fair
and
never
proud
Had
tongue
at
will
and
yet
was
never
loud
Never
lackd
gold
and
yet
went
never
gay
Fled
from
her
wish
and
yet
said
Now
I
may
She
that
being
angerd
her
revenge
being
nigh
Bade
her
wrong
stay
and
her
displeasure
fly
She
that
in
wisdom
never
was
so
frail
To
change
the
cods
head
for
the
salmons
tail
She
that
could
think
and
neer
disclose
her
mind
See
suitors
following
and
not
look
behind
She
was
a
wight
if
ever
such
wight
were
To
do
what
To
suckle
fools
and
chronicle
small
beer
most
lame
and
impotent
conclusion
Do
not
learn
of
him
Emilia
though
he
be
thy
husband
How
say
you
Cassio
Is
he
not
a
most
profane
and
liberal
counselor
He
speaks
home
madam
You
may
relish
him
more
in
the
soldier
than
in
the
scholar
Aside
He
takes
her
by
the
palm
ay
well
said
whisper
With
as
little
a
web
as
this
will
I
ensnare
as
great
a
fly
as
Cassio
Ay
smile
upon
her
do
I
will
gyve
thee
in
thine
own
courtship
You
say
true
tis
so
indeed
If
such
tricks
as
these
strip
you
out
of
your
lieutenantry
it
had
been
better
you
had
not
kissed
your
three
fingers
so
oft
which
now
again
you
are
most
apt
to
play
the
sir
in
Very
good
Well
kissed
an
excellent
courtesy
tis
so
indeed
Yet
again
your
fingers
to
your
lips
Would
they
were
clysterpipes
for
your
sake
Trumpet
within
The
Moor
I
know
his
trumpet
Tis
truly
so
Lets
meet
him
and
receive
him
Lo
where
he
comes
Enter
Othello
and
Attendants
my
fair
warrior
My
dear
Othello
It
gives
me
wonder
great
as
my
content
To
see
you
here
before
me
my
souls
joy
If
after
every
tempest
come
such
calms
May
the
winds
blow
till
they
have
wakend
death
And
let
the
laboring
bark
climb
hills
of
seas
Olympushigh
and
duck
again
as
low
As
hells
from
heaven
If
it
were
now
to
die
Twere
now
to
be
most
happy
for
I
fear
My
soul
hath
her
content
so
absolute
That
not
another
comfort
like
to
this
Succeeds
in
unknown
fate
The
heavens
forbid
But
that
our
loves
and
comforts
should
increase
Even
as
our
days
do
grow
Amen
to
that
sweet
powers
I
cannot
speak
enough
of
this
content
It
stops
me
here
it
is
too
much
of
joy
And
this
and
this
the
greatest
discords
be
Kisses
her
That
eer
our
hearts
shall
make
Aside
you
are
well
tuned
now
But
Ill
set
down
the
pegs
that
make
this
music
As
honest
as
I
am
Come
let
us
to
the
castle
News
friends
our
wars
are
done
the
Turks
are
drownd
How
does
my
old
acquaintance
of
this
isle
Honey
you
shall
be
well
desired
in
Cyprus
I
have
found
great
love
amongst
them
my
sweet
I
prattle
out
of
fashion
and
I
dote
In
mine
own
comforts
I
prithee
good
Iago
Go
to
the
bay
and
disembark
my
coffers
Bring
thou
the
master
to
the
citadel
He
is
a
good
one
and
his
worthiness
Does
challenge
much
respect
Come
Desdemona
Once
more
well
met
at
Cyprus
Do
thou
meet
me
presently
at
the
harbor
Come
hither
If
thou
best
valiant
as
they
say
base
men
being
in
love
have
then
a
nobility
in
their
natures
more
than
is
native
to
them
list
me
The
lieutenant
tonight
watches
on
the
court
of
guard
First
I
must
tell
thee
this
Desdemona
is
directly
in
love
with
him
With
him
Why
tis
not
possible
Lay
thy
finger
thus
and
let
thy
soul
be
instructed
Mark
me
with
what
violence
she
first
loved
the
Moor
but
for
bragging
and
telling
her
fantastical
lies
And
will
she
love
him
still
for
prating
Let
not
thy
discreet
heart
think
it
Her
eye
must
be
fed
and
what
delight
shall
she
have
to
look
on
the
devil
When
the
blood
is
made
dull
with
the
act
of
sport
there
should
be
again
to
inflame
it
and
to
give
satiety
a
fresh
appetite
loveliness
in
favor
sympathy
in
years
manners
and
beauties
all
which
the
Moor
is
defective
in
Now
for
want
of
these
required
conveniences
her
delicate
tenderness
will
find
itself
abused
begin
to
heave
the
gorge
disrelish
and
abhor
the
Moor
very
nature
will
instruct
her
in
it
and
compel
her
to
some
second
choice
Now
sir
this
granted
as
it
is
a
most
pregnant
and
unforced
position
who
stands
so
eminently
in
the
degree
of
this
fortune
as
Cassio
does
knave
very
voluble
no
further
conscionable
than
in
putting
on
the
mere
form
of
civil
and
humane
seeming
for
the
better
compass
of
his
salt
and
most
hidden
loose
affection
Why
none
why
none
a
slipper
and
subtle
knave
a
finder
out
of
occasions
that
has
an
eye
can
stamp
and
counterfeit
advantages
though
true
advantage
never
present
itself
a
devilish
knave
Besides
the
knave
is
handsome
young
and
hath
all
those
requisites
in
him
that
folly
and
green
minds
look
after
a
pestilent
complete
knave
and
the
woman
hath
found
him
already
I
cannot
believe
that
in
her
shes
full
of
most
blest
condition
Blest
figsend
The
wine
she
drinks
is
made
of
grapes
If
she
had
been
blest
she
would
never
have
loved
the
Moor
Blest
pudding
Didst
thou
not
see
her
paddle
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
Didst
not
mark
that
Yes
that
I
did
but
that
was
but
courtesy
Lechery
by
this
hand
an
index
and
obscure
prologue
to
the
history
of
lust
and
foul
thoughts
They
met
so
near
with
their
lips
that
their
breaths
embraced
together
Villainous
thoughts
Roderigo
When
these
mutualities
so
marshal
the
way
hard
at
hand
comes
the
master
and
main
exercise
the
incorporate
conclusion
Pish
But
sir
be
you
ruled
by
me
I
have
brought
you
from
Venice
Watch
you
tonight
for
the
command
Ill
layt
upon
you
Cassio
knows
you
not
Ill
not
be
far
from
you
Do
you
find
some
occasion
to
anger
Cassio
either
by
speaking
too
loud
or
tainting
his
discipline
or
from
what
other
course
you
please
which
the
time
shall
more
favorably
minister
Well
Sir
he
is
rash
and
very
sudden
in
choler
and
haply
may
strike
at
you
Provoke
him
that
he
may
for
even
out
of
that
will
I
cause
these
of
Cyprus
to
mutiny
whose
qualification
shall
come
into
no
true
taste
again
but
by
the
displanting
of
Cassio
So
shall
you
have
a
shorter
journey
to
your
desires
by
the
means
I
shall
then
have
to
prefer
them
and
the
impediment
most
profitably
removed
without
the
which
there
were
no
expectation
of
our
prosperity
I
will
do
this
if
I
can
bring
it
to
any
opportunity
I
warrant
thee
Meet
me
by
and
by
at
the
citadel
I
must
fetch
his
necessaries
ashore
Farewell
Adieu
That
Cassio
loves
her
I
do
well
believe
it
That
she
loves
him
tis
apt
and
of
great
credit
The
Moor
howbeit
that
I
endure
him
not
Is
of
a
constant
loving
noble
nature
And
I
dare
think
hell
prove
to
Desdemona
most
dear
husband
Now
I
do
love
her
too
Not
out
of
absolute
lust
though
peradventure
I
stand
accountant
for
as
great
a
sin
But
partly
led
to
diet
my
revenge
For
that
I
do
suspect
the
lusty
Moor
Hath
leapd
into
my
seat
the
thought
whereof
Doth
like
a
poisonous
mineral
gnaw
my
inwards
And
nothing
can
or
shall
content
my
soul
Till
I
am
evend
with
him
wife
for
wife
Or
failing
so
yet
that
I
put
the
Moor
At
least
into
a
jealousy
so
strong
That
judgement
cannot
cure
Which
thing
to
do
If
this
poor
trash
of
Venice
whom
I
trace
For
his
quick
hunting
stand
the
putting
on
Ill
have
our
Michael
Cassio
on
the
hip
Abuse
him
to
the
Moor
in
the
rank
garb
For
I
fear
Cassio
with
my
nightcap
too
Make
the
Moor
thank
me
love
me
and
reward
me
For
making
him
egregiously
an
ass
And
practicing
upon
his
peace
and
quiet
Even
to
madness
Tis
here
but
yet
confused
Knaverys
plain
face
is
never
seen
till
used
hall
in
the
castle
Enter
Othello
Desdemona
Cassio
and
Attendants
Good
Michael
look
you
to
the
guard
tonight
Lets
teach
ourselves
that
honorable
stop
Not
to
outsport
discretion
Iago
hath
direction
what
to
do
But
notwithstanding
with
my
personal
eye
Will
I
look
tot
Iago
is
most
honest
Michael
good
night
Tomorrow
with
your
earliest
Let
me
have
speech
with
you
Come
my
dear
love
The
purchase
made
the
fruits
are
to
ensue
That
profits
yet
to
come
tween
me
and
you
Good
night
Enter
Iago
Welcome
Iago
we
must
to
the
watch
Not
this
hour
lieutenant
tis
not
yet
ten
o
the
clock
Our
general
cast
us
thus
early
for
the
love
of
his
Desdemona
who
let
us
not
therefore
blame
He
hath
not
yet
made
wanton
the
night
with
her
and
she
is
sport
for
Jove
Shes
a
most
exquisite
lady
And
Ill
warrant
her
full
of
game
Indeed
shes
a
most
fresh
and
delicate
creature
What
an
eye
she
has
Methinks
it
sounds
a
parley
to
provocation
An
inviting
eye
and
yet
methinks
right
modest
And
when
she
speaks
is
it
not
an
alarum
to
love
She
is
indeed
perfection
Well
happiness
to
their
sheets
Come
lieutenant
I
have
a
stope
of
wine
and
here
without
are
a
brace
of
Cyprus
gallants
that
would
fain
have
a
measure
to
the
health
of
black
Othello
Not
tonight
good
Iago
I
have
very
poor
and
unhappy
brains
for
drinking
I
could
well
wish
courtesy
would
invent
some
other
custom
of
entertainment
they
are
our
friends
But
one
cup
Ill
drink
for
you
I
have
drunk
but
one
cup
tonight
and
that
was
craftily
qualified
too
and
behold
what
innovation
it
makes
here
I
am
unfortunate
in
the
infirmity
and
dare
not
task
my
weakness
with
any
more
What
man
Tis
a
night
of
revels
the
gallants
desire
it
Where
are
they
Here
at
the
door
I
pray
you
call
them
in
Ill
dot
but
it
dislikes
me
If
I
can
fasten
but
one
cup
upon
him
With
that
which
he
hath
drunk
tonight
already
Hell
be
as
full
of
quarrel
and
offense
As
my
young
mistress
dog
Now
my
sick
fool
Roderigo
Whom
love
hath
turnd
almost
the
wrong
side
out
To
Desdemona
hath
tonight
caroused
Potations
pottledeep
and
hes
to
watch
Three
lads
of
Cyprus
noble
swelling
spirits
That
hold
their
honors
in
a
wary
distance
The
very
elements
of
this
warlike
isle
Have
I
tonight
flusterd
with
flowing
cups
And
they
watch
too
Now
mongst
this
flock
of
drunkards
Am
I
to
put
our
Cassio
in
some
action
That
may
offend
the
isle
But
here
they
come
If
consequence
do
but
approve
my
dream
My
boat
sails
freely
both
with
wind
and
stream
Reenter
Cassio
with
him
Montano
and
Gentlemen
Servants
following
with
wine
Fore
God
they
have
given
me
a
rouse
already
Good
faith
a
little
one
not
past
a
pint
as
I
am
a
soldier
Some
wine
ho
Sings
And
let
me
the
canakin
clink
clink
And
let
me
the
canakin
clink
soldiers
a
man
mans
lifes
but
a
span
Why
then
let
a
soldier
drink
Some
wine
boys
Fore
God
an
excellent
song
I
learned
it
in
England
where
indeed
they
are
most
potent
in
potting
Your
Dane
your
German
and
your
swagbellied
Hollander
Drink
ho
are
nothing
to
your
English
Is
your
Englishman
so
expert
in
his
drinking
Why
he
drinks
you
with
facility
your
Dane
dead
drunk
he
sweats
not
to
overthrow
your
Almain
he
gives
your
Hollander
a
vomit
ere
the
next
pottle
can
be
filled
To
the
health
of
our
general
I
am
for
it
lieutenant
and
Ill
do
you
justice
sweet
England
Sings
King
Stephen
was
anda
worthy
peer
His
breeches
cost
him
but
a
crown
He
held
them
sixpence
all
too
dear
With
that
he
calld
the
tailor
lown
He
was
a
wight
of
high
renown
And
thou
art
but
of
low
degree
Tis
pride
that
pulls
the
country
down
Then
take
thine
auld
cloak
about
thee
Some
wine
ho
Why
this
is
a
more
exquisite
song
than
the
other
Will
you
heart
again
No
for
I
hold
him
to
be
unworthy
of
his
place
that
does
those
things
Well
Gods
above
all
and
there
be
souls
must
be
saved
and
there
be
souls
must
not
be
saved
Its
true
good
lieutenant
For
mine
own
part
no
offense
to
the
general
nor
any
man
of
quality
I
hope
to
be
saved
And
so
do
I
too
lieutenant
Ay
but
by
your
leave
not
before
me
the
lieutenant
is
to
be
saved
before
the
ancient
Lets
have
no
more
of
this
lets
to
our
affairs
God
forgive
us
our
sins
Gentlemen
lets
look
to
our
business
Do
not
think
gentlemen
I
am
drunk
this
is
my
ancient
this
is
my
right
hand
and
this
is
my
left
I
am
not
drunk
now
I
can
stand
well
enough
and
I
speak
well
enough
Excellent
well
Why
very
well
then
you
must
not
think
then
that
I
am
drunk
To
the
platform
masters
come
lets
set
the
watch
You
see
this
fellow
that
is
gone
before
He
is
a
soldier
fit
to
stand
by
Caesar
And
give
direction
And
do
but
see
his
vice
Tis
to
his
virtue
a
just
equinox
The
one
as
long
as
the
other
Tis
pity
of
him
I
fear
the
trust
Othello
puts
him
in
On
some
odd
time
of
his
infirmity
Will
shake
this
island
But
is
he
often
thus
Tis
evermore
the
prologue
to
his
sleep
Hell
watch
the
horologe
a
double
set
If
drink
rock
not
his
cradle
It
were
well
The
general
were
put
in
mind
of
it
Perhaps
he
sees
it
not
or
his
good
nature
Prizes
the
virtue
that
appears
in
Cassio
And
looks
not
on
his
evils
Is
not
this
true
Enter
Roderigo
Aside
to
him
How
now
Roderigo
I
pray
you
after
the
lieutenant
go
And
tis
great
pity
that
the
noble
Moor
Should
hazard
such
a
place
as
his
own
second
With
one
of
an
ingraft
infirmity
It
were
an
honest
action
to
say
So
to
the
Moor
Not
I
for
this
fair
island
I
do
love
Cassio
well
and
would
do
much
To
cure
him
of
this
evil
But
hark
What
noise
cry
within
Help
help
Reenter
Cassio
driving
in
Roderigo
Zounds

You

Reenter
Othello
and
Attendants
What
is
the
matter
here
Zounds
I
bleed

I
am
hurt
to
the
death
Faints
Hold

your
lives
Hold

Lieutenant
sir
Montano
gentlemen
Have
you
forgot
all
place
of
sense
and
duty
Hold

you
Hold

for
shame
Why
how
now
ho
from
whence
ariseth
this
Are
we
turnd
Turks
and
to

do
that
Which
heaven
hath
forbid
the
Ottomites
For
Christian
shame
put
by
this
barbarous
brawl
He
that
stirs
next
to
carve
for
his
own
rage
Holds
his
soul
light
he
dies
upon
his
motion
Silence
that
dreadful
bell
it
frights
the
isle
From
her
propriety
What
is
the
matter
masters
Honest
Iago
that
lookst
dead
with
grieving
Speak
who
began
this
On
thy
love
I
charge
thee
I
do
not
know
Friends
all
but
now
even
now
In
quarter
and
in
terms
like
bride
and
groom
Devesting
them
for
bed
and
then
but
now
As
if
some
planet
had
unwitted
men
Swords
out
and
tilting
one
at
others
breast
In
opposition
bloody
I
cannot
speak
Any
beginning
to
this
peevish
odds
And
would
in
action
glorious
I
had
lost
Those
legs
that
brought
me
to
a
part
of
it
How
comes
it
Michael
you
are
thus
forgot
I
pray
you
pardon
me
I
cannot
speak
Worthy
Montano
you
were
wont
be
civil
The
gravity
and
stillness
of
your
youth
The
world
hath
noted
and
your
name
is
great
In
mouths
of
wisest
censure
Whats
the
matter
That
you
unlace
your
reputation
thus
And
spend
your
rich
opinion
for
the
name
Of
a
nightbrawler
Give
me
answer
to
it
Worthy
Othello
I
am
hurt
to
danger
Your
officer
Iago
can
inform
you
While
I
spare
speech
which
something
now
offends
me
Of
all
that
I
do
know
Nor
know
I
aught
By
me
thats
said
or
done
amiss
this
night
Unless
selfcharity
be
sometimes
a
vice
And
to
defend
ourselves
it
be
a
sin
When
violence
assails
us
Now
by
heaven
My
blood
begins
my
safer
guides
to
rule
And
passion
having
my
best
judgement
collied
Assays
to
lead
the
way
If
I
once
stir
Or
do
but
lift
this
arm
the
best
of
you
Shall
sink
in
my
rebuke
Give
me
to
know
How
this
foul
rout
began
who
set
it
on
And
he
that
is
approved
in
this
offense
Though
he
had
twinnd
with
me
both
at
a
birth
Shall
lose
me
What
in
a
town
of
war
Yet
wild
the
peoples
hearts
brimful
of
fear
To
manage
private
and
domestic
quarrel
In
night
and
on
the
court
and
guard
of
safety
Tis
monstrous
Iago
who
begant
If
partially
affined
or
leagued
in
office
Thou
dost
deliver
more
or
less
than
truth
Thou
art
no
soldier
Touch
me
not
so
near
I
had
rather
have
this
tongue
cut
from
my
mouth
Than
it
should
do
offense
to
Michael
Cassio
Yet
I
persuade
myself
to
speak
the
truth
Shall
nothing
wrong
him
Thus
it
is
general
Montano
and
myself
being
in
speech
There
comes
a
fellow
crying
out
for
help
And
Cassio
following
him
with
determined
sword
To
execute
upon
him
Sir
this
gentleman
Steps
in
to
Cassio
and
entreats
his
pause
Myself
the
crying
fellow
did
pursue
Lest
by
his
clamor
as
it
so
fell
out
The
town
might
fall
in
fright
He
swift
of
foot
Outran
my
purpose
and
I
returnd
the
rather
For
that
I
heard
the
clink
and
fall
of
swords
And
Cassio
high
in
oath
which
till
tonight
I
neer
might
say
before
When
I
came
back
For
this
was
brief
I
found
them
close
together
At
blow
and
thrust
even
as
again
they
were
When
you
yourself
did
part
them
More
of
this
matter
cannot
I
report
But
men
are
men
the
best
sometimes
forget
Though
Cassio
did
some
little
wrong
to
him
As
men
in
rage
strike
those
that
wish
them
best
Yet
surely
Cassio
I
believe
received
From
him
that
fled
some
strange
indignity
Which
patience
could
not
pass
I
know
Iago
Thy
honesty
and
love
doth
mince
this
matter
Making
it
light
to
Cassio
Cassio
I
love
thee
But
never
more
be
officer
of
mine
Reenter
Desdemona
attended
Look
if
my
gentle
love
be
not
raised
up
Ill
make
thee
an
example
Whats
the
matter
Alls
well
now
sweeting
come
away
to
bed
Sir
for
your
hurts
myself
will
be
your
surgeon
Lead
him
off
Iago
look
with
care
about
the
town
And
silence
those
whom
this
vile
brawl
distracted
Come
Desdemona
tis
the
soldiers
life
To
have
their
balmy
slumbers
waked
with
strife
What
are
you
hurt
lieutenant
Ay
past
all
surgery
Marry
heaven
forbid
Reputation
reputation
reputation
I
have
lost
my
reputation
I
have
lost
the
immortal
part
of
myself
and
what
remains
is
bestial
My
reputation
Iago
my
reputation
As
I
am
an
honest
man
I
thought
you
had
received
some
bodily
wound
there
is
more
sense
in
that
than
in
reputation
Reputation
is
an
idle
and
most
false
imposition
oft
got
without
merit
and
lost
without
deserving
You
have
lost
no
reputation
at
all
unless
you
repute
yourself
such
a
loser
What
man
there
are
ways
to
recover
the
general
again
You
are
but
now
cast
in
his
mood
a
punishment
more
in
policy
than
in
malice
even
so
as
one
would
beat
his
offenseless
dog
to
affright
an
imperious
lion
Sue
to
him
again
and
hes
yours
I
will
rather
sue
to
be
despised
than
to
deceive
so
good
a
commander
with
so
slight
so
drunken
and
so
indiscreet
an
officer
Drunk
and
speak
parrot
and
squabble
swagger
swear
and
discourse
fustian
with
ones
own
shadow
thou
invisible
spirit
of
wine
if
thou
hast
no
name
to
be
known
by
let
us
call
thee
devil
What
was
he
that
you
followed
with
your
sword
What
had
he
done
to
you
I
know
not
Ist
possible
I
remember
a
mass
of
things
but
nothing
distinctly
a
quarrel
but
nothing
wherefore
God
that
men
should
put
an
enemy
in
their
mouths
to
steal
away
their
brains
that
we
should
with
joy
pleasance
revel
and
applause
transform
ourselves
into
beasts
Why
but
you
are
now
well
enough
How
came
you
thus
recovered
It
hath
pleased
the
devil
drunkenness
to
give
place
to
the
devil
wrath
one
unperfectness
shows
me
another
to
make
me
frankly
despise
myself
Come
you
are
too
severe
a
moraler
As
the
time
the
place
and
the
condition
of
this
country
stands
I
could
heartily
wish
this
had
not
befallen
but
since
it
is
as
it
is
mend
it
for
your
own
good
I
will
ask
him
for
my
place
again
he
shall
tell
me
I
am
a
drunkard
Had
I
as
many
mouths
as
Hydra
such
an
answer
would
stop
them
all
To
be
now
a
sensible
man
by
and
by
a
fool
and
presently
a
beast
strange
Every
inordinate
cup
is
unblest
and
the
ingredient
is
a
devil
Come
come
good
wine
is
a
good
familiar
creature
if
it
be
well
used
Exclaim
no
more
against
it
And
good
lieutenant
I
think
you
think
I
love
you
I
have
well
approved
it
sir
I
drunk
You
or
any
man
living
may
be
drunk
at
some
time
man
Ill
tell
you
what
you
shall
do
Our
generals
wife
is
now
the
general
I
may
say
so
in
this
respect
for
that
he
hath
devoted
and
given
up
himself
to
the
contemplation
mark
and
denotement
of
her
parts
and
graces
Confess
yourself
freely
to
her
importune
her
help
to
put
you
in
your
place
again
She
is
of
so
free
so
kind
so
apt
so
blessed
a
disposition
she
holds
it
a
vice
in
her
goodness
not
to
do
more
than
she
is
requested
This
broken
joint
between
you
and
her
husband
entreat
her
to
splinter
and
my
fortunes
against
any
lay
worth
naming
this
crack
of
your
love
shall
grow
stronger
than
it
was
before
You
advise
me
well
I
protest
in
the
sincerity
of
love
and
honest
kindness
I
think
it
freely
and
betimes
in
the
morning
I
will
beseech
the
virtuous
Desdemona
to
undertake
for
me
I
am
desperate
of
my
fortunes
if
they
check
me
here
You
are
in
the
right
Good
night
lieutenant
I
must
to
the
watch
Good
night
honest
Iago
And
whats
he
then
that
says
I
play
the
villain
When
this
advice
is
free
I
give
and
honest
Probal
to
thinking
and
indeed
the
course
To
win
the
Moor
again
For
tis
most
easy
The
inclining
Desdemona
to
subdue
In
any
honest
suit
Shes
framed
as
fruitful
As
the
free
elements
And
then
for
her
To
win
the
Moor
weret
to
renounce
his
baptism
All
seals
and
symbols
of
redeemed
sin
His
soul
is
so
enfetterd
to
her
love
That
she
may
make
unmake
do
what
she
list
Even
as
her
appetite
shall
play
the
god
With
his
weak
function
How
am
I
then
a
villain
To
counsel
Cassio
to
this
parallel
course
Directly
to
his
good
Divinity
of
hell
When
devils
will
the
blackest
sins
put
on
They
do
suggest
at
first
with
heavenly
shows
As
I
do
now
For
whiles
this
honest
fool
Plies
Desdemona
to
repair
his
fortune
And
she
for
him
pleads
strongly
to
the
Moor
Ill
pour
this
pestilence
into
his
ear
That
she
repeals
him
for
her
bodys
lust
And
by
how
much
she
strives
to
do
him
good
She
shall
undo
her
credit
with
the
Moor
So
will
I
turn
her
virtue
into
pitch
And
out
of
her
own
goodness
make
the
net
That
shall
enmesh
them
all
Enter
Roderigo
How
now
Roderigo
I
do
follow
here
in
the
chase
not
like
a
hound
that
hunts
but
one
that
fills
up
the
cry
My
money
is
almost
spent
I
have
been
tonight
exceedingly
well
cudgeled
and
I
think
the
issue
will
be
I
shall
have
so
much
experience
for
my
pains
and
so
with
no
money
at
all
and
a
little
more
wit
return
again
to
Venice
How
poor
are
they
that
have
not
patience
What
wound
did
ever
heal
but
by
degrees
Thou
knowst
we
work
by
wit
and
not
by
witchcraft
And
wit
depends
on
dilatory
time
Doest
not
go
well
Cassio
hath
beaten
thee
And
thou
by
that
small
hurt
hast
cashierd
Cassio
Though
other
things
grow
fair
against
the
sun
Yet
fruits
that
blossom
first
will
first
be
ripe
Content
thyself
awhile
By
the
mass
tis
morning
Pleasure
and
action
make
the
hours
seem
short
Retire
thee
go
where
thou
art
billeted
Away
I
say
Thou
shalt
know
more
hereafter
Nay
get
thee
gone
My
wife
must
move
for
Cassio
to
her
mistress
Ill
set
her
on
Myself
the
while
to
draw
the
Moor
apart
And
bring
him
jump
when
he
may
Cassio
find
Soliciting
his
wife
Ay
thats
the
way
Dull
not
device
by
coldness
and
delay
I
Before
the
castle
Enter
Cassio
and
some
Musicians
Masters
play
here
I
will
content
your
pains
Something
thats
brief
and
bid
Good
morrow
general
Music
Enter
Clown
Why
masters
have
your
instruments
been
in
Naples
that
they
speak
i
the
nose
thus
How
sir
how
Are
these
I
pray
you
wind
instruments
Ay
marry
are
they
sir
thereby
hangs
a
tail
Whereby
hangs
a
tale
sir
Marry
sir
by
many
a
wind
instrument
that
I
know
But
masters
heres
money
for
you
and
the
general
so
likes
your
music
that
he
desires
you
for
loves
sake
to
make
no
more
noise
with
it
Well
sir
we
will
not
If
you
have
any
music
that
may
not
be
heard
tot
again
but
as
they
say
to
hear
music
the
general
does
not
greatly
care
We
have
none
such
sir
Then
put
up
your
pipes
in
your
bag
for
Ill
away
Go
vanish
into
air
away
Dost
thou
hear
my
honest
friend
No
I
hear
not
your
honest
friend
I
hear
you
Prithee
keep
up
thy
quillets
Theres
a
poor
piece
of
gold
for
thee
If
the
gentlewoman
that
attends
the
generals
wife
be
stirring
tell
her
theres
one
Cassio
entreats
her
a
little
favor
of
speech
Wilt
thou
do
this
She
is
stirring
sir
If
she
will
stir
hither
I
shall
seem
to
notify
unto
her
Do
good
my
friend
Enter
Iago
In
happy
time
Iago
You
have
not
been
abed
then
Why
no
the
day
had
broke
Before
we
parted
I
have
made
bold
Iago
To
send
in
to
your
wife
My
suit
to
her
Is
that
she
will
to
virtuous
Desdemona
Procure
me
some
access
Ill
send
her
to
you
presently
And
Ill
devise
a
mean
to
draw
the
Moor
Out
of
the
way
that
your
converse
and
business
May
be
more
free
I
humbly
thank
you
fort
Florentine
more
kind
and
honest
Enter
Emilia
Good
morrow
good
lieutenant
I
am
sorry
For
your
displeasure
but
all
will
sure
be
well
The
general
and
his
wife
are
talking
of
it
And
she
speaks
for
you
stoutly
The
Moor
replies
That
he
you
hurt
is
of
great
fame
in
Cyprus
And
great
affinity
and
that
in
wholesome
wisdom
He
might
not
but
refuse
you
but
he
protests
he
loves
you
And
needs
no
other
suitor
but
his
likings
To
take
the
safest
occasion
by
the
front
To
bring
you
in
again
Yet
I
beseech
you
If
you
think
fit
or
that
it
may
be
done
Give
me
advantage
of
some
brief
discourse
With
Desdemona
alone
Pray
you
come
in
I
will
bestow
you
where
you
shall
have
time
To
speak
your
bosom
freely
I
am
much
bound
to
you
Be
thou
assured
good
Cassio
I
will
do
All
my
abilities
in
thy
behalf
Good
madam
do
I
warrant
it
grieves
my
husband
As
if
the
cause
were
his
thats
an
honest
fellow
Do
not
doubt
Cassio
But
I
will
have
my
lord
and
you
again
As
friendly
as
you
were
Bounteous
madam
Whatever
shall
become
of
Michael
Cassio
Hes
never
anything
but
your
true
servant
I
knowt
I
thank
you
You
do
love
my
lord
You
have
known
him
long
and
be
you
well
assured
He
shall
in
strangeness
stand
no
farther
off
Than
in
a
politic
distance
Ay
but
lady
That
policy
may
either
last
so
long
Or
feed
upon
such
nice
and
waterish
diet
Or
breed
itself
so
out
of
circumstances
That
I
being
absent
and
my
place
supplied
My
general
will
forget
my
love
and
service
Do
not
doubt
that
Before
Emilia
here
I
give
thee
warrant
of
thy
place
assure
thee
If
I
do
vow
a
friendship
Ill
perform
it
To
the
last
article
My
lord
shall
never
rest
Ill
watch
him
tame
and
talk
him
out
of
patience
His
bed
shall
seem
a
school
his
board
a
shrift
Ill
intermingle
everything
he
does
With
Cassios
suit
Therefore
be
merry
Cassio
For
thy
solicitor
shall
rather
die
Than
give
thy
cause
away
Enter
Othello
and
Iago
at
a
distance
Madam
here
comes
my
lord
Madam
Ill
take
my
leave
Nay
stay
and
hear
me
speak
Madam
not
now
I
am
very
ill
at
ease
Unfit
for
mine
own
purposes
Well
do
your
discretion
Ha
I
like
not
that
What
dost
thou
say
Nothing
my
lord
or
if
I
know
not
what
Was
not
that
Cassio
parted
from
my
wife
Cassio
my
lord
No
sure
I
cannot
think
it
That
he
would
steal
away
so
guiltylike
Seeing
you
coming
I
do
believe
twas
he
How
now
my
lord
I
have
been
talking
with
a
suitor
here
man
that
languishes
in
your
displeasure
Who
ist
you
mean
Why
your
lieutenant
Cassio
Good
my
lord
If
I
have
any
grace
or
power
to
move
you
His
present
reconciliation
take
For
if
he
be
not
one
that
truly
loves
you
That
errs
in
ignorance
and
not
in
cunning
I
have
no
judgement
in
an
honest
face
I
prithee
call
him
back
Went
he
hence
now
Ay
sooth
so
humbled
That
he
hath
left
part
of
his
grief
with
me
To
suffer
with
him
Good
love
call
him
back
Not
now
sweet
Desdemona
some
other
time
But
shallt
be
shortly
The
sooner
sweet
for
you
Shallt
be
tonight
at
supper
No
not
tonight
Tomorrow
dinner
then
I
shall
not
dine
at
home
I
meet
the
captains
at
the
citadel
Why
then
tomorrow
night
or
Tuesday
morn
On
Tuesday
noon
or
night
on
Wednesday
morn
I
prithee
name
the
time
but
let
it
not
Exceed
three
days
In
faith
hes
penitent
And
yet
his
trespass
in
our
common
reason
Save
that
they
say
the
wars
must
make
example
Out
of
their
best
is
not
almost
a
fault
To
incur
a
private
check
When
shall
he
come
Tell
me
Othello
I
wonder
in
my
soul
What
you
would
ask
me
that
I
should
deny
Or
stand
so
mammering
on
What
Michael
Cassio
That
came
awooing
with
you
and
so
many
a
time
When
I
have
spoke
of
you
dispraisingly
Hath
taen
your
part
to
have
so
much
to
do
To
bring
him
in
Trust
me
I
could
do
much
Prithee
no
more
Let
him
come
when
he
will
I
will
deny
thee
nothing
Why
this
is
not
a
boon
Tis
as
I
should
entreat
you
wear
your
gloves
Or
feed
on
nourishing
dishes
or
keep
you
warm
Or
sue
to
you
to
do
a
peculiar
profit
To
your
own
person
Nay
when
I
have
a
suit
Wherein
I
mean
to
touch
your
love
indeed
It
shall
be
full
of
poise
and
difficult
weight
And
fearful
to
be
granted
I
will
deny
thee
nothing
Whereon
I
do
beseech
thee
grant
me
this
To
leave
me
but
a
little
to
myself
Shall
I
deny
you
No
Farewell
my
lord
Farewell
my
Desdemona
Ill
come
to
thee
straight
Emilia
come
Be
as
your
fancies
teach
you
Whateer
you
be
I
am
obedient
Excellent
wretch
Perdition
catch
my
soul
But
I
do
love
thee
and
when
I
love
thee
not
Chaos
is
come
again
My
noble
lord
What
dost
thou
say
Iago
Did
Michael
Cassio
when
you
wood
my
lady
Know
of
your
love
He
did
from
first
to
last
Why
dost
thou
ask
But
for
a
satisfaction
of
my
thought
No
further
harm
Why
of
thy
thought
Iago
I
did
not
think
he
had
been
acquainted
with
her
yes
and
went
between
us
very
oft
Indeed
Indeed
ay
indeed
Discernst
thou
aught
in
that
Is
he
not
honest
Honest
my
lord
Honest
Ay
honest
My
lord
for
aught
I
know
What
dost
thou
think
Think
my
lord
Think
my
lord
By
heaven
he
echoes
me
As
if
there
were
some
monster
in
his
thought
Too
hideous
to
be
shown
Thou
dost
mean
something
I
heard
thee
say
even
now
thou
likest
not
that
When
Cassio
left
my
wife
What
didst
not
like
And
when
I
told
thee
he
was
of
my
counsel
In
my
whole
course
of
wooing
thou
criedst
Indeed
And
didst
contract
and
purse
thy
brow
together
As
if
thou
then
hadst
shut
up
in
thy
brain
Some
horrible
conceit
If
thou
dost
love
me
Show
me
thy
thought
My
lord
you
know
I
love
you
I
think
thou
dost
And
for
I
know
thourt
full
of
love
and
honesty
And
weighst
thy
words
before
thou
givest
them
breath
Therefore
these
stops
of
thine
fright
me
the
more
For
such
things
in
a
false
disloyal
knave
Are
tricks
of
custom
but
in
a
man
thats
just
Theyre
close
dilations
working
from
the
heart
That
passion
cannot
rule
For
Michael
Cassio
I
dare
be
sworn
I
think
that
he
is
honest
I
think
so
too
Men
should
be
what
they
seem
Or
those
that
be
not
would
they
might
seem
none
Certain
men
should
be
what
they
seem
Why
then
I
think
Cassios
an
honest
man
Nay
yet
theres
more
in
this
I
prithee
speak
to
me
as
to
thy
thinkings
As
thou
dost
ruminate
and
give
thy
worst
of
thoughts
The
worst
of
words
Good
my
lord
pardon
me
Though
I
am
bound
to
every
act
of
duty
I
am
not
bound
to
that
all
slaves
are
free
to
Utter
my
thoughts
Why
say
they
are
vile
and
false
As
wheres
that
palace
whereinto
foul
things
Sometimes
intrude
not
Who
has
a
breast
so
pure
But
some
uncleanly
apprehensions
Keep
leets
and
lawdays
and
in
session
sit
With
meditations
lawful
Thou
dost
conspire
against
thy
friend
Iago
If
thou
but
thinkst
him
wrongd
and
makest
his
ear
stranger
to
thy
thoughts
I
do
beseech
you
Though
I
perchance
am
vicious
in
my
guess
As
I
confess
it
is
my
natures
plague
To
spy
into
abuses
and
oft
my
jealousy
Shapes
faults
that
are
not
that
your
wisdom
yet
From
one
that
so
imperfectly
conceits
Would
take
no
notice
nor
build
yourself
a
trouble
Out
of
his
scattering
and
unsure
observance
It
were
not
for
your
quiet
nor
your
good
Nor
for
my
manhood
honesty
or
wisdom
To
let
you
know
my
thoughts
What
dost
thou
mean
Good
name
in
man
and
woman
dear
my
lord
Is
the
immediate
jewel
of
their
souls
Who
steals
my
purse
steals
trash
tis
something
nothing
Twas
mine
tis
his
and
has
been
slave
to
thousands
But
he
that
filches
from
me
my
good
name
Robs
me
of
that
which
not
enriches
him
And
makes
me
poor
indeed
By
heaven
Ill
know
thy
thoughts
You
cannot
if
my
heart
were
in
your
hand
Nor
shall
not
whilst
tis
in
my
custody
Ha
beware
my
lord
of
jealousy
It
is
the
greeneyed
monster
which
doth
mock
The
meat
it
feeds
on
That
cuckold
lives
in
bliss
Who
certain
of
his
fate
loves
not
his
wronger
But
what
damned
minutes
tells
he
oer
Who
dotes
yet
doubts
suspects
yet
strongly
loves
misery
Poor
and
content
is
rich
and
rich
enough
But
riches
fineless
is
as
poor
as
winter
To
him
that
ever
fears
he
shall
be
poor
Good
heaven
the
souls
of
all
my
tribe
defend
From
jealousy
Why
why
is
this
Thinkst
thou
Ild
make
a
life
of
jealousy
To
follow
still
the
changes
of
the
moon
With
fresh
suspicions
No
To
be
once
in
doubt
Is
once
to
be
resolved
Exchange
me
for
a
goat
When
I
shall
turn
the
business
of
my
soul
To
such
exsufflicate
and
blown
surmises
Matching
thy
inference
Tis
not
to
make
me
jealous
To
say
my
wife
is
fair
feeds
well
loves
company
Is
free
of
speech
sings
plays
and
dances
well
Where
virtue
is
these
are
more
virtuous
Nor
from
mine
own
weak
merits
will
I
draw
The
smallest
fear
or
doubt
of
her
revolt
For
she
had
eyes
and
chose
me
No
Iago
Ill
see
before
I
doubt
when
I
doubt
prove
And
on
the
proof
there
is
no
more
but
this
Away
at
once
with
love
or
jealousy
I
am
glad
of
it
for
now
I
shall
have
reason
To
show
the
love
and
duty
that
I
bear
you
With
franker
spirit
Therefore
as
I
am
bound
Receive
it
from
me
I
speak
not
yet
of
proof
Look
to
your
wife
observe
her
well
with
Cassio
Wear
your
eye
thus
not
jealous
nor
secure
I
would
not
have
your
free
and
noble
nature
Out
of
selfbounty
be
abused
Look
tot
I
know
our
country
disposition
well
In
Venice
they
do
let
heaven
see
the
pranks
They
dare
not
show
their
husbands
their
best
conscience
Is
not
to
leavet
undone
but
keept
unknown
Dost
thou
say
so
She
did
deceive
her
father
marrying
you
And
when
she
seemd
to
shake
and
fear
your
looks
She
loved
them
most
And
so
she
did
Why
go
to
then
She
that
so
young
could
give
out
such
a
seeming
To
seel
her
fathers
eyes
up
close
as
oak
He
thought
twas
witchcraft
but
I
am
much
to
blame
I
humbly
do
beseech
you
of
your
pardon
For
too
much
loving
you
I
am
bound
to
thee
forever
I
see
this
hath
a
little
dashd
your
spirits
Not
a
jot
not
a
jot
Ifaith
I
fear
it
has
I
hope
you
will
consider
what
is
spoke
Comes
from
my
love
But
I
do
see
youre
moved
I
am
to
pray
you
not
to
strain
my
speech
To
grosser
issues
nor
to
larger
reach
Than
to
suspicion
I
will
not
Should
you
do
so
my
lord
My
speech
should
fall
into
such
vile
success
Which
my
thoughts
aim
not
at
Cassios
my
worthy
friend
My
lord
I
see
youre
moved
No
not
much
moved
I
do
not
think
but
Desdemonas
honest
Long
live
she
so
and
long
live
you
to
think
so
And
yet
how
nature
erring
from
itself
Ay
theres
the
point
as
to
be
bold
with
you
Not
to
affect
many
proposed
matches
Of
her
own
clime
complexion
and
degree
Whereto
we
see
in
all
things
nature
tends
Foh
one
may
smell
in
such
a
will
most
rank
Foul
disproportion
thoughts
unnatural
But
pardon
me
I
do
not
in
position
Distinctly
speak
of
her
though
I
may
fear
Her
will
recoiling
to
her
better
judgement
May
fall
to
match
you
with
her
country
forms
And
happily
repent
Farewell
farewell
If
more
thou
dost
perceive
let
me
know
more
Set
on
thy
wife
to
observe
Leave
me
Iago
Going
My
lord
I
take
my
leave
Why
did
I
marry
This
honest
creature
doubtless
Sees
and
knows
more
much
more
than
he
unfolds
Returning
My
lord
I
would
I
might
entreat
your
honor
To
scan
this
thing
no
further
leave
it
to
time
Though
it
be
fit
that
Cassio
have
his
place
For
sure
he
fills
it
up
with
great
ability
Yet
if
you
please
to
hold
him
off
awhile
You
shall
by
that
perceive
him
and
his
means
Note
if
your
lady
strain
his
entertainment
With
any
strong
or
vehement
importunity
Much
will
be
seen
in
that
In
the
meantime
Let
me
be
thought
too
busy
in
my
fears
As
worthy
cause
I
have
to
fear
I
am
And
hold
her
free
I
do
beseech
your
honor
Fear
not
my
government
I
once
more
take
my
leave
This
fellows
of
exceeding
honesty
And
knows
all
qualities
with
a
learned
spirit
Of
human
dealings
If
I
do
prove
her
haggard
Though
that
her
jesses
were
my
dear
heartstrings
Ild
whistle
her
off
and
let
her
down
the
wind
To
prey
at
fortune
Haply
for
I
am
black
And
have
not
those
soft
parts
of
conversation
That
chamberers
have
or
for
I
am
declined
Into
the
vale
of
years
yet
thats
not
much
Shes
gone
I
am
abused
and
my
relief
Must
be
to
loathe
her
curse
of
marriage
That
we
can
call
these
delicate
creatures
ours
And
not
their
appetites
I
had
rather
be
a
toad
And
live
upon
the
vapor
of
a
dungeon
Than
keep
a
corner
in
the
thing
I
love
For
others
uses
Yet
tis
the
plague
of
great
ones
Prerogatived
are
they
less
than
the
base
Tis
destiny
unshunnable
like
death
Even
then
this
forked
plague
is
fated
to
us
When
we
do
quicken
Desdemona
comes
Reenter
Desdemona
and
Emilia
If
she
be
false
then
heaven
mocks
itself
Ill
not
believet
How
now
my
dear
Othello
Your
dinner
and
the
generous
islanders
By
you
invited
do
attend
your
presence
I
am
to
blame
Why
do
you
speak
so
faintly
Are
you
not
well
I
have
a
pain
upon
my
forehead
here
Faith
thats
with
watching
twill
away
again
Let
me
but
bind
it
hard
within
this
hour
It
will
be
well
Your
napkin
is
too
little
He
puts
the
handkerchief
from
him
and
she
drops
it
Let
it
alone
Come
Ill
go
in
with
you
I
am
very
sorry
that
you
are
not
well
I
am
glad
I
have
found
this
napkin
This
was
her
first
remembrance
from
the
Moor
My
wayward
husband
hath
a
hundred
times
Wood
me
to
steal
it
but
she
so
loves
the
token
For
he
conjured
her
she
should
ever
keep
it
That
she
reserves
it
evermore
about
her
To
kiss
and
talk
to
Ill
have
the
work
taen
out
And
givet
Iago
What
he
will
do
with
it
Heaven
knows
not
I
I
nothing
but
to
please
his
fantasy
Reenter
Iago
How
now
what
do
you
here
alone
Do
not
you
chide
I
have
a
thing
for
you
thing
for
me
It
is
a
common
thing
Ha
To
have
a
foolish
wife
is
that
all
What
will
you
give
me
now
For
that
same
handkerchief
What
handkerchief
What
handkerchief
Why
that
the
Moor
first
gave
to
Desdemona
That
which
so
often
you
did
bid
me
steal
Hast
stoln
it
from
her
No
faith
she
let
it
drop
by
negligence
And
to
the
advantage
I
being
here
tookt
up
Look
here
it
is
good
wench
give
it
me
What
will
you
do
witht
that
you
have
been
so
earnest
To
have
me
filch
it
Snatching
it
Why
what
is
that
to
you
Ift
be
not
for
some
purpose
of
import
Givet
me
again
Poor
lady
shell
run
mad
When
she
shall
lack
it
Be
not
acknown
ont
I
have
use
for
it
Go
leave
me
I
will
in
Cassios
lodging
lose
this
napkin
And
let
him
find
it
Trifles
light
as
air
Are
to
the
jealous
confirmations
strong
As
proofs
of
holy
writ
this
may
do
something
The
Moor
already
changes
with
my
poison
Dangerous
conceits
are
in
their
natures
poisons
Which
at
the
first
are
scarce
found
to
distaste
But
with
a
little
act
upon
the
blood
Burn
like
the
mines
of
sulphur
I
did
say
so
Look
where
he
comes
Reenter
Othello
Not
poppy
nor
mandragora
Nor
all
the
drowsy
syrups
of
the
world
Shall
ever
medicine
thee
to
that
sweet
sleep
Which
thou
owedst
yesterday
Ha
ha
false
to
me
Why
how
now
general
No
more
of
that
Avaunt
be
gone
Thou
hast
set
me
on
the
rack
I
swear
tis
better
to
be
much
abused
Than
but
to
knowt
a
little
How
now
my
lord
What
sense
had
I
of
her
stoln
hours
of
lust
I
sawt
not
thought
it
not
it
harmd
not
me
I
slept
the
next
night
well
was
free
and
merry
I
found
not
Cassios
kisses
on
her
lips
He
that
is
robbd
not
wanting
what
is
stoln
Let
him
not
knowt
and
hes
not
robbd
at
all
I
am
sorry
to
hear
this
I
had
been
happy
if
the
general
camp
Pioners
and
all
had
tasted
her
sweet
body
So
I
had
nothing
known
now
forever
Farewell
the
tranquil
mind
Farewell
content
Farewell
the
plumed
troop
and
the
big
wars
That
make
ambition
virtue
farewell
Farewell
the
neighing
steed
and
the
shrill
trump
The
spiritstirring
drum
the
earpiercing
fife
The
royal
banner
and
all
quality
Pride
pomp
and
circumstance
of
glorious
war
And
you
mortal
engines
whose
rude
throats
The
immortal
Joves
dread
clamors
counterfeit
Farewell
Othellos
occupations
gone
Ist
possible
my
lord
Villain
be
sure
thou
prove
my
love
a
whore
Be
sure
of
it
Give
me
the
ocular
proof
Or
by
the
worth
of
mans
eternal
soul
Thou
hadst
been
better
have
been
born
a
dog
Than
answer
my
waked
wrath
Ist
come
to
this
Make
me
to
seet
or
at
the
least
so
prove
it
That
the
probation
bear
no
hinge
nor
loop
To
hang
a
doubt
on
or
woe
upon
thy
life
My
noble
lord
If
thou
dost
slander
her
and
torture
me
Never
pray
more
abandon
all
remorse
On
horrors
head
horrors
accumulate
Do
deeds
to
make
heaven
weep
all
earth
amazed
For
nothing
canst
thou
to
damnation
add
Greater
than
that
grace
heaven
defend
me
Are
you
a
man
have
you
a
soul
or
sense
God
be
wi
you
take
mine
office
wretched
fool
That
livest
to
make
thine
honesty
a
vice
monstrous
world
Take
note
take
note
world
To
be
direct
and
honest
is
not
safe
I
thank
you
for
this
profit
and
from
hence
Ill
love
no
friend
sith
love
breeds
such
offense
Nay
stay
thou
shouldst
be
honest
I
should
be
wise
for
honestys
a
fool
And
loses
that
it
works
for
By
the
world
I
think
my
wife
be
honest
and
think
she
is
not
I
think
that
thou
art
just
and
think
thou
art
not
Ill
have
some
proof
Her
name
that
was
as
fresh
As
Dians
visage
is
now
begrimed
and
black
As
mine
own
face
If
there
be
cords
or
knives
Poison
or
fire
or
suffocating
streams
Ill
not
endure
it
Would
I
were
satisfied
I
see
sir
you
are
eaten
up
with
passion
I
do
repent
me
that
I
put
it
to
you
You
would
be
satisfied
Would
Nay
I
will
And
may
But
how
how
satisfied
my
lord
Would
you
the
supervisor
grossly
gape
on
Behold
her
toppd
Death
and
damnation
It
were
a
tedious
difficulty
I
think
To
bring
them
to
that
prospect
Damn
them
then
If
ever
mortal
eyes
do
see
them
bolster
More
than
their
own
What
then
how
then
What
shall
I
say
Wheres
satisfaction
It
is
impossible
you
should
see
this
Were
they
as
prime
as
goats
as
hot
as
monkeys
As
salt
as
wolves
in
pride
and
fools
as
gross
As
ignorance
made
drunk
But
yet
I
say
If
imputation
and
strong
circumstances
Which
lead
directly
to
the
door
of
truth
Will
give
you
satisfaction
you
may
havet
Give
me
a
living
reason
shes
disloyal
I
do
not
like
the
office
But
sith
I
am
enterd
in
this
cause
so
far
Prickd
tot
by
foolish
honesty
and
love
I
will
go
on
I
lay
with
Cassio
lately
And
being
troubled
with
a
raging
tooth
I
could
not
sleep
There
are
a
kind
of
men
so
loose
of
soul
That
in
their
sleeps
will
mutter
their
affairs
One
of
this
kind
is
Cassio
In
sleep
I
heard
him
say
Sweet
Desdemona
Let
us
be
wary
let
us
hide
our
loves
And
then
sir
would
he
gripe
and
wring
my
hand
Cry
sweet
creature
and
then
kiss
me
hard
As
if
he
pluckd
up
kisses
by
the
roots
That
grew
upon
my
lips
then
laid
his
leg
Over
my
thigh
and
sighd
and
kissd
and
then
Cried
Cursed
fate
that
gave
thee
to
the
Moor
monstrous
monstrous
Nay
this
was
but
his
dream
But
this
denoted
a
foregone
conclusion
Tis
a
shrewd
doubt
though
it
be
but
a
dream
And
this
may
help
to
thicken
other
proofs
That
do
demonstrate
thinly
Ill
tear
her
all
to
pieces
Nay
but
be
wise
yet
we
see
nothing
done
She
may
be
honest
yet
Tell
me
but
this
Have
you
not
sometimes
seen
a
handkerchief
Spotted
with
strawberries
in
your
wifes
hand
I
gave
her
such
a
one
twas
my
first
gift
I
know
not
that
but
such
a
handkerchief
I
am
sure
it
was
your
wifes
did
I
today
See
Cassio
wipe
his
beard
with
If
it
be
that
If
it
be
that
or
any
that
was
hers
It
speaks
against
her
with
the
other
proofs
that
the
slave
had
forty
thousand
lives
One
is
too
poor
too
weak
for
my
revenge
Now
do
I
see
tis
true
Look
here
Iago
All
my
fond
love
thus
do
I
blow
to
heaven
Tis
gone
Arise
black
vengeance
from
thy
hollow
hell
Yield
up
love
thy
crown
and
hearted
throne
To
tyrannous
hate
Swell
bosom
with
thy
fraught
For
tis
of
aspics
tongues
Yet
be
content
blood
blood
blood
Patience
I
say
your
mind
perhaps
may
change
Never
Iago
Like
to
the
Pontic
Sea
Whose
icy
current
and
compulsive
course
Neer
feels
retiring
ebb
but
keeps
due
on
To
the
Propontic
and
the
Hellespont
Even
so
my
bloody
thoughts
with
violent
pace
Shall
neer
look
back
neer
ebb
to
humble
love
Till
that
a
capable
and
wide
revenge
Swallow
them
up
Now
by
yond
marble
heaven
In
the
due
reverence
of
a
sacred
vow
Kneels
I
here
engage
my
words
Do
not
rise
yet
Kneels
Witness
you
everburning
lights
above
You
elements
that
clip
us
round
about
Witness
that
here
Iago
doth
give
up
The
execution
of
his
wit
hands
heart
To
wrongd
Othellos
service
Let
him
command
And
to
obey
shall
be
in
me
remorse
What
bloody
business
ever
They
rise
I
greet
thy
love
Not
with
vain
thanks
but
with
acceptance
bounteous
And
will
upon
the
instant
put
thee
tot
Within
these
three
days
let
me
hear
thee
say
That
Cassios
not
alive
My
friend
is
dead
tis
done
at
your
request
But
let
her
live
Damn
her
lewd
minx
damn
her
Come
go
with
me
apart
I
will
withdraw
To
furnish
me
with
some
swift
means
of
death
For
the
fair
devil
Now
art
thou
my
lieutenant
I
am
your
own
forever
room
in
the
castle
Enter
Othello
and
Emilia
You
have
seen
nothing
then
Nor
ever
heard
nor
ever
did
suspect
Yes
you
have
seen
Cassio
and
she
together
But
then
I
saw
no
harm
and
then
I
heard
Each
syllable
that
breath
made
up
between
them
What
did
they
never
whisper
Never
my
lord
Nor
send
you
out
o
the
way
Never
To
fetch
her
fan
her
gloves
her
mask
nor
nothing
Never
my
lord
Thats
strange
I
durst
my
lord
to
wager
she
is
honest
Lay
down
my
soul
at
stake
If
you
think
other
Remove
your
thought
it
doth
abuse
your
bosom
If
any
wretch
have
put
this
in
your
head
Let
heaven
requite
it
with
the
serpents
curse
For
if
she
be
not
honest
chaste
and
true
Theres
no
man
happy
the
purest
of
their
wives
Is
foul
as
slander
Bid
her
come
hither
go
She
says
enough
yet
shes
a
simple
bawd
That
cannot
say
as
much
This
is
a
subtle
whore
closet
lock
and
key
of
villainous
secrets
And
yet
shell
kneel
and
pray
I
have
seen
her
dot
Enter
Desdemona
with
Emilia
My
lord
what
is
your
will
Pray
chuck
come
hither
What
is
your
pleasure
Let
me
see
your
eyes
Look
in
my
face
What
horrible
fancys
this
To
Emilia
Some
of
your
function
mistress
Leave
procreants
alone
and
shut
the
door
Cough
or
cry
hem
if
anybody
come
Your
mystery
your
mystery
nay
dispatch
Upon
my
knees
what
doth
your
speech
import
I
understand
a
fury
in
your
words
But
not
the
words
Why
what
art
thou
Your
wife
my
lord
your
true
and
loyal
wife
Come
swear
it
damn
thyself
Lest
being
like
one
of
heaven
the
devils
themselves
Should
fear
to
seize
thee
Therefore
be
doubledamnd
Swear
thou
art
honest
Heaven
doth
truly
know
it
Heaven
truly
knows
that
thou
art
false
as
hell
To
whom
my
lord
with
whom
how
am
I
false
Desdemona
Away
away
away
Alas
the
heavy
day
Why
do
you
weep
Am
I
the
motive
of
these
tears
my
lord
If
haply
you
my
father
do
suspect
An
instrument
of
this
your
calling
back
Lay
not
your
blame
on
me
If
you
have
lost
him
Why
I
have
lost
him
too
Had
it
pleased
heaven
To
try
me
with
affliction
had
they
raind
All
kinds
of
sores
and
shames
on
my
bare
head
Steepd
me
in
poverty
to
the
very
lips
Given
to
captivity
me
and
my
utmost
hopes
I
should
have
found
in
some
place
of
my
soul
drop
of
patience
but
alas
to
make
me
fixed
figure
for
the
time
of
scorn
To
point
his
slow
unmoving
finger
at
Yet
could
I
bear
that
too
well
very
well
But
there
where
I
have
garnerd
up
my
heart
Where
either
I
must
live
or
bear
no
life
The
fountain
from
the
which
my
current
runs
Or
else
dries
up
to
be
discarded
thence
Or
keep
it
as
a
cistern
for
foul
toads
To
knot
and
gender
in
Turn
thy
complexion
there
Patience
thou
young
and
roselippd
cherubin
Ay
there
look
grim
as
hell
I
hope
my
noble
lord
esteems
me
honest
ay
as
summer
flies
are
in
the
shambles
That
quicken
even
with
blowing
thou
weed
Who
art
so
lovely
fair
and
smellst
so
sweet
That
the
sense
aches
at
thee
would
thou
hadst
neer
been
born
Alas
what
ignorant
sin
have
I
committed
Was
this
fair
paper
this
most
goodly
book
Made
to
write
whore
upon
What
committed
Committed
thou
public
commoner
I
should
make
very
forges
of
my
cheeks
That
would
to
cinders
burn
up
modesty
Did
I
but
speak
thy
deeds
What
committed
Heaven
stops
the
nose
at
it
and
the
moon
winks
The
bawdy
wind
that
kisses
all
it
meets
Is
hushd
within
the
hollow
mine
of
earth
And
will
not
hear
it
What
committed
Impudent
strumpet
By
heaven
you
do
me
wrong
Are
not
you
a
strumpet
No
as
I
am
a
Christian
If
to
preserve
this
vessel
for
my
lord
From
any
other
foul
unlawful
touch
Be
not
to
be
a
strumpet
I
am
none
What
not
a
whore
No
as
I
shall
be
saved
Ist
possible
heaven
forgive
us
I
cry
you
mercy
then
I
took
you
for
that
cunning
whore
of
Venice
That
married
with
Othello
Raises
his
voice
You
mistress
That
have
the
office
opposite
to
Saint
Peter
And
keep

gate
of
hell
Reenter
Emilia
You

We

your
pains
I

our
counsel
Alas

How

How

Faith
half

Good

Who

thy
lord
He

sweet
lady
I

none
Do
not
talk
to

Emilia
I
cannot
weep
nor
answer
have
I

But
what
should
go
by
water
Prithee
tonight
Lay
on
my
bed
my
wedding
sheets
Remember
And
call
thy
husband
hither
Heres
a
change
indeed
Tis
meet
I
should
be
used
so
very
meet
How
have
I
been
behaved
that
he
might
stick
The
smallst
opinion
on
my
least
misuse
Reenter
Emilia
with
Iago
What
is
your
pleasure
madam
How
ist
with
you
I
cannot
tell
Those
that
do
teach
young
babes
Do
it
with
gentle
means
and
easy
tasks
He
might
have
chid
me
so
for
in
good
faith
I
am
a
child
to
chiding
Whats
the
matter
lady
Alas
Iago
my
lord
hath
so
bewhored
her
Thrown
such
despite
and
heavy
terms
upon
her
As
true
hearts
cannot
bear
Am
I
that
name
Iago
What
name
fair
lady
Such
as
she
says
my
lord
did
say
I
was
He
calld
her
whore
a
beggar
in
his
drink
Could
not
have
laid
such
terms
upon
his
callet
Why
did
he
so
I
do
not
know
I
am
sure
I
am
none
such
Do
not
weep
do
not
weep
Alas
the
day
Hath
she
forsook
so
many
noble
matches
Her
father
and
her
country
and
her
friends
To
be
calld
whore
Would
it
not
make
one
weep
It
is
my
wretched
fortune
Beshrew
him
fort
How
comes
this
trick
upon
him
Nay
heaven
doth
know
I
will
be
hangd
if
some
eternal
villain
Some
busy
and
insinuating
rogue
Some
cogging
cozening
slave
to
get
some
office
Have
not
devised
this
slander
Ill
be
hangd
else
Fie
there
is
no
such
man
it
is
impossible
If
any
such
there
be
heaven
pardon
him
halter
pardon
him
And
hell
gnaw
his
bones
Why
should
he
call
her
whore
Who
keeps
her
company
What
place
What
time
What
form
What
likelihood
The
Moors
abused
by
some
most
villainous
knave
Some
base
notorious
knave
some
scurvy
fellow
heaven
that
such
companions
thouldst
unfold
And
put
in
every
honest
hand
a
whip
To
lash
the
rascals
naked
through
the
world
Even
from
the
east
to
the
west
Speak
within
door
fie
upon
them
Some
such
squire
he
was
That
turnd
your
wit
the
seamy
side
without
And
made
you
to
suspect
me
with
the
Moor
You
are
a
fool
go
to
good
Iago
What
shall
I
do
to
win
my
lord
again
Good
friend
go
to
him
for
by
this
light
of
heaven
I
know
not
how
I
lost
him
Here
I
kneel
If
eer
my
will
did
trespass
gainst
his
love
Either
in
discourse
of
thought
or
actual
deed
Or
that
mine
eyes
mine
ears
or
any
sense
Delighted
them
in
any
other
form
Or
that
I
do
not
yet
and
ever
did
And
ever
will
though
he
do
shake
me
off
To
beggarly
divorcement
love
him
dearly
Comfort
forswear
me
Unkindness
may
do
much
And
his
unkindness
may
defeat
my
life
But
never
taint
my
love
I
cannot
say
whore
It
doth
abhor
me
now
I
speak
the
word
To
do
the
act
that
might
the
addition
earn
Not
the
worlds
mass
of
vanity
could
make
me
I
pray
you
be
content
tis
but
his
humor
The
business
of
the
state
does
him
offense
And
he
does
chide
with
you
If
twere
no
other
Tis
but
so
I
warrant
Trumpets
within
Hark
how
these
instruments
summon
to
supper
The
messengers
of
Venice
stay
the
meat
Go
in
and
weep
not
all
things
shall
be
well
Enter
Roderigo
How
now
Roderigo
I
do
not
find
that
thou
dealest
justly
with
me
What
in
the
contrary
Every
day
thou
daffest
me
with
some
device
Iago
and
rather
as
it
seems
to
me
now
keepest
from
me
all
conveniency
than
suppliest
me
with
the
least
advantage
of
hope
I
will
indeed
no
longer
endure
it
nor
am
I
yet
persuaded
to
put
up
in
peace
what
already
I
have
foolishly
suffered
Will
you
hear
me
Roderigo
Faith
I
have
heard
too
much
for
your
words
and
performances
are
no
kin
together
You
charge
me
most
unjustly
With
nought
but
truth
I
have
wasted
myself
out
of
my
means
The
jewels
you
have
had
from
me
to
deliver
to
Desdemona
would
half
have
corrupted
a
votarist
You
have
told
me
she
hath
received
them
and
returned
me
expectations
and
comforts
of
sudden
respect
and
acquaintance
but
I
find
none
Well
go
to
very
well
Very
well
go
to
I
cannot
go
to
man
nor
tis
not
very
well
By
this
hand
I
say
tis
very
scurvy
and
begin
to
find
myself
fopped
in
it
Very
well
I
tell
you
tis
not
very
well
I
will
make
myself
known
to
Desdemona
If
she
will
return
me
my
jewels
I
will
give
over
my
suit
and
repent
my
unlawful
solicitation
if
not
assure
yourself
I
will
seek
satisfaction
of
you
You
have
said
now
Ay
and
said
nothing
but
what
I
protest
intendment
of
doing
Why
now
I
see
theres
mettle
in
thee
and
even
from
this
instant
do
build
on
thee
a
better
opinion
than
ever
before
Give
me
thy
hand
Roderigo
Thou
hast
taken
against
me
a
most
just
exception
but
yet
I
protest
have
dealt
most
directly
in
thy
affair
It
hath
not
appeared
I
grant
indeed
it
hath
not
appeared
and
your
suspicion
is
not
without
wit
and
judgement
But
Roderigo
if
thou
hast
that
in
thee
indeed
which
I
have
greater
reason
to
believe
now
than
ever
I
mean
purpose
courage
and
valor
this
night
show
it
if
thou
the
next
night
following
enjoy
not
Desdemona
take
me
from
this
world
with
treachery
and
devise
engines
for
my
life
Well
what
is
it
Is
it
within
reason
and
compass
Sir
there
is
especial
commission
come
from
Venice
to
depute
Cassio
in
Othellos
place
Is
that
true
Why
then
Othello
and
Desdemona
return
again
to
Venice
no
he
goes
into
Mauritania
and
takes
away
with
him
the
fair
Desdemona
unless
his
abode
be
lingered
here
by
some
accident
wherein
none
can
be
so
determinate
as
the
removing
of
Cassio
How
do
you
mean
removing
of
him
Why
by
making
him
uncapable
of
Othellos
place
knocking
out
his
brains
And
that
you
would
have
me
to
do
Ay
if
you
dare
do
yourself
a
profit
and
a
right
He
sups
tonight
with
a
harlotry
and
thither
will
I
go
to
him
He
knows
not
yet
of
his
honorable
fortune
If
you
will
watch
his
going
thence
which
his
will
fashion
to
fall
out
between
twelve
and
one
you
may
take
him
at
your
pleasure
I
will
be
near
to
second
your
attempt
and
he
shall
fall
between
us
Come
stand
not
amazed
at
it
but
go
along
with
me
I
will
show
you
such
a
necessity
in
his
death
that
you
shall
think
yourself
bound
to
put
it
on
him
It
is
now
high
suppertime
and
the
night
grows
to
waste
About
it
I
will
hear
further
reason
for
this
And
you
shall
be
satisfied
bedchamber
in
the
castle
Desdemona
in
bed
asleep
a
light
burning
Enter
Othello
It
is
the
cause
it
is
the
cause
my
soul
Let
me
not
name
it
to
you
you
chaste
stars
It
is
the
cause
Yet
Ill
not
shed
her
blood
Nor
scar
that
whiter
skin
of
hers
than
snow
And
smooth
as
monumental
alabaster
Yet
she
must
die
else
shell
betray
more
men
Put
out
the
light
and
then
put
out
the
light
If
I
quench
thee
thou
flaming
minister
I
can
again
thy
former
light
restore
Should
I
repent
me
but
once
put
out
thy
light
Thou
cunningst
pattern
of
excelling
nature
I
know
not
where
is
that
Promethean
heat
That
can
thy
light
relume
When
I
have
pluckd
the
rose
I
cannot
give
it
vital
growth
again
It
must
needs
wither
Ill
smell
it
on
the
tree
Kisses
her
balmy
breath
that
dost
almost
persuade
Justice
to
break
her
sword
One
more
one
more
Be
thus
when
thou
art
dead
and
I
will
kill
thee
And
love
thee
after
One
more
and
this
the
last
So
sweet
was
neer
so
fatal
I
must
weep
But
they
are
cruel
tears
this
sorrows
heavenly
It
strikes
where
it
doth
love
She
wakes
Whos
there
Othello
Ay
Desdemona
Will
you
come
to
bed
my
lord
Have
you
prayd
tonight
Desdemona
Ay
my
lord
If
you
bethink
yourself
of
any
crime
Unreconciled
as
yet
to
heaven
and
grace
Solicit
for
it
straight
Alas
my
lord
what
may
you
mean
by
that
Well
do
it
and
be
brief
I
will
walk
by
I
would
not
kill
thy
unprepared
spirit
No
heaven
forfend
I
would
not
kill
thy
soul
Talk
you
of
killing
Ay
I
do
Then
heaven
have
mercy
on
me
Amen
with
all
my
heart
If
you
say
so
I
hope
you
will
not
kill
me
Hum
And
yet
I
fear
you
for
you
are
fatal
then
When
your
eyes
roll
so
Why
I
should
fear
I
know
not
Since
guiltiness
I
know
not
but
yet
I
feel
I
fear
Think
on
thy
sins
They
are
loves
I
bear
to
you
Ay
and
for
that
thou
diest
That
deaths
unnatural
that
kills
for
loving
Alas
why
gnaw
you
so
your
nether
lip
Some
bloody
passion
shakes
your
very
frame
These
are
portents
but
yet
I
hope
I
hope
They
do
not
point
on
me
Peace
and
be
still
I
will
so
Whats
the
matter
That
handkerchief
which
I
so
loved
and
gave
thee
Thou
gavest
to
Cassio
No
by
my
life
and
soul
Send
for
the
man
and
ask
him
Sweet
soul
take
heed
Take
heed
of
perjury
thou
are
on
thy
deathbed
Ay
but
not
yet
to
die
Yes
presently
Therefore
confess
thee
freely
of
thy
sin
For
to
deny
each
article
with
oath
Cannot
remove
nor
choke
the
strong
conception
That
I
do
groan
withal
Thou
art
to
die
Then
Lord
have
mercy
on
me
I
say
amen
And
have
you
mercy
too
I
never
did
Offend
you
in
my
life
never
loved
Cassio
But
with
such
general
warranty
of
heaven
As
I
might
love
I
never
gave
him
token
By
heaven
I
saw
my
handkerchief
in
s
hand
perjured
woman
Thou
dost
stone
my
heart
And
makest
me
call
what
I
intend
to
do
murther
which
I
thought
a
sacrifice
I
saw
the
handkerchief
He
found
it
then
I
never
gave
it
him
Send
for
him
hither
Let
him
confess
a
truth
He
hath
confessd
What
my
lord
That
he
hath
used
thee
How
unlawfully
Ay
He
will
not
say
so
No
his
mouth
is
stoppd
Honest
Iago
hath
taen
order
fort
my
fear
interprets
What
is
he
dead
Had
all
his
hairs
been
lives
my
great
revenge
Had
stomach
for
them
all
Alas
he
is
betrayd
and
I
undone
Out
strumpet
Weepst
thou
for
him
to
my
face
banish
me
my
lord
but
kill
me
not
Down
strumpet
Kill
me
tomorrow
let
me
live
tonight
Nay
if
you
strive
But
half
an
hour
Being
done
there
is
no
pause
But
while
I
say
one
prayer
It
is
too
late
He
stifles
her
Within
My
lord
my
lord
What
ho
my
lord
my
lord
What
noise
is
this
Not
dead
not
yet
quite
dead
I
that
am
cruel
am
yet
merciful
I
would
not
have
thee
linger
in
thy
pain
So
so
Within
What
ho
my
lord
my
lord
Whos
there
Within
good
my
lord
I
would
speak
a
word
with
you
Yes
tis
Emilia
By
and
by
Shes
dead
Tis
like
she
comes
to
speak
of
Cassios
death
The
noise
was
here
Ha
no
more
moving
Still
as
the
grave
Shall
she
come
in
weret
good
I
think
she
stirs
again
No
Whats
best
to
do
If
she
come
in
shell
sure
speak
to
my
wife
My
wife
My
wife
What
wife
I
have
no
wife
insupportable
heavy
hour
Methinks
it
should
be
now
a
huge
eclipse
Of
sun
and
moon
and
that
the
affrighted
globe
Should
yawn
at
alteration
Within
I
do
beseech
you
That
I
may
speak
with
you
good
my
lord
I
had
forgot
thee
come
in
Emilia
Soft
by
and
by
Let
me
the
curtains
draw
Where
art
thou
Unlocks
the
door
Enter
Emilia
Whats
the
matter
with
thee
now
my
good
lord
yonders
foul
murthers
done
What
now
But
now
my
lord
It
is
the
very
error
of
the
moon
She
comes
more
nearer
earth
than
she
was
wont
And
makes
men
mad
Cassio
my
lord
hath
killd
a
young
Venetian
Calld
Roderigo
Roderigo
killd
And
Cassio
killd
No
Cassio
is
not
killd
Not
Cassio
killd
Then
murthers
out
of
tune
And
sweet
revenge
grows
harsh
falsely
falsely
murtherd
Alas
what
cry
is
that
That
what
Out
and
alas
That
was
my
ladys
voice
Help
help
ho
help
lady
speak
again
Sweet
Desdemona
sweet
mistress
speak
guiltless
death
I

who
hath
done
this
deed
Nobody
I

Farewell
Commend
me
to
my
kind
lord
farewell
Dies
Why
how
should
she
be
murtherd
Alas
who
knows
You
heard
her
say
herself
it
was
not
I
She
said
so
I
must
needs
report
the
truth
Shes
like
a
liar
gone
to
burning
hell
Twas
I
that
killd
her
the
more
angel
she
And
you
the
blacker
devil
She
turnd
to
folly
and
she
was
a
whore
Thou
dost
belie
her
and
thou
art
a
devil
She
was
false
as
water
Thou
art
rash
as
fire
to
say
That
she
was
false
she
was
heavenly
true
Cassio
did
top
her
ask
thy
husband
else
I
were
damnd
beneath
all
depth
in
hell
But
that
I
did
proceed
upon
just
grounds
To
this
extremity
Thy
husband
knew
it
all
My
husband
Thy
husband
That
she
was
false
to
wedlock
Ay
with
Cassio
Nay
had
she
been
true
If
heaven
would
make
me
such
another
world
Of
one
entire
and
perfect
chrysolite
Ild
not
have
sold
her
for
it
My
husband
Ay
twas
he
that
told
me
first
An
honest
man
he
is
and
hates
the
slime
That
sticks
on
filthy
deeds
My
husband
What
needs
this
iteration
woman
I
say
thy
husband
mistress
villainy
hath
made
mocks
with
love
My
husband
say
that
she
was
false
He
woman
I
say
thy
husband
Dost
understand
the
word
My
friend
thy
husband
honest
honest
Iago
If
he
say
so
may
his
pernicious
soul
Rot
half
a
grain
a
day
He
lies
to
the
heart
She
was
too
fond
of
her
most
filthy
bargain
Ha
Do
thy
worst
This
deed
of
thine
is
no
more
worthy
heaven
Than
thou
wast
worthy
her
Peace
you
were
best
Thou
hast
not
half
that
power
to
do
me
harm
As
I
have
to
be
hurt
gull
dolt
As
ignorant
as
dirt
Thou
hast
done
a
deed
I
care
not
for
thy
sword
Ill
make
thee
known
Though
I
lost
twenty
lives
Help
help
ho
help
The
Moor
hath
killd
my
mistress
Murther

Enter
Montano
Gratiano
Iago
and
others
What
is
the
matter
How
now
general
are
you
come
Iago
You
have
done
well
That
men
must
lay
their
murthers
on
your
neck
What
is
the
matter
Disprove
this
villain
if
thou
best
a
man
He
says
thou
toldst
him
that
his
wife
was
false
I
know
thou
didst
not
thourt
not
such
a
villain
Speak
for
my
heart
is
full
I
told
him
what
I
thought
and
told
no
more
Than
what
he
found
himself
was
apt
and
true
But
did
you
ever
tell
him
she
was
false
I
did
You
told
a
lie
an
odious
damned
lie
Upon
my
soul
a
lie
a
wicked
lie
She
false
with
Cassio
Did
you
say
with
Cassio
With
Cassio
mistress
Go
to
charm
your
tongue
I
will
not
charm
my
tongue
I
am
bound
to
speak
My
mistress
here
lies
murtherd
in
her
bed
heavens
forfend
And
your
reports
have
set
the
murther
on
Nay
stare
not
masters
it
is
true
indeed
Tis
a
strange
truth
monstrous
act
Villainy
villainy
villainy
I
think
upont
I
think
I
smellt
villainy
I
thought
so
then
Ill
kill
myself
for
grief
villainy
villainy
What
are
you
mad
I
charge
you
get
you
home
Good
gentlemen
let
me
have
leave
to
speak
Tis
proper
I
obey
him
but
not
now
Perchance
Iago
I
will
neer
go
home
Falls
on
the
bed
Nay
lay
thee
down
and
roar
For
thou
hast
killd
the
sweetest
innocent
That
eer
did
lift
up
eye
Rises
she
was
foul
I
scarce
did
know
you
uncle
there
lies
your
niece
Whose
breath
indeed
these
hands
have
newly
stoppd
I
know
this
act
shows
horrible
and
grim
Poor
Desdemon
I
am
glad
thy
fathers
dead
Thy
match
was
mortal
to
him
and
pure
grief
Shore
his
old
thread
in
twain
did
he
live
now
This
sight
would
make
him
do
a
desperate
turn
Yea
curse
his
better
angel
from
his
side
And
fall
to
reprobation
Tis
pitiful
but
yet
Iago
knows
That
she
with
Cassio
hath
the
act
of
shame
thousand
times
committed
Cassio
confessd
it
And
she
did
gratify
his
amorous
works
With
that
recognizance
and
pledge
of
love
Which
I
first
gave
her
I
saw
it
in
his
hand
It
was
a
handkerchief
an
antique
token
My
father
gave
my
mother
heaven
heavenly
powers
Zounds
Hold
your
peace
Twill
out
twill
I
peace
No
I
will
speak
as
liberal
as
the
north
Let
heaven
and
men
and
devils
let
them
all
All
all
cry
shame
against
me
yet
Ill
speak
Be
wise
and
get
you
home
I
will
not
Iago
offers
to
stab
Emilia
Fie
Your
sword
upon
a
woman
thou
dull
Moor
That
handkerchief
thou
speakst
of
I
found
by
fortune
and
did
give
my
husband
For
often
with
a
solemn
earnestness
More
than
indeed
belongd
to
such
a
trifle
He
beggd
of
me
to
steal
it
Villainous
whore
She
give
it
Cassio
No
alas
I
found
it
And
I
did
givet
my
husband
Filth
thou
liest
By
heaven
I
do
not
I
do
not
gentlemen
murtherous
coxcomb
What
should
such
a
fool
Do
with
so
good
a
wife
Are
there
not
stones
in
heaven
But
what
serve
for
thunder
Precious
villain
He
runs
at
Iago
but
Montano
disarms
him
Iago
stabs
Emilia
The
woman
falls
sure
he
hath
killd
his
wife
Ay
ay
lay
me
by
my
mistress
side
Hes
gone
but
his
wifes
killd
Tis
a
notorious
villain
Take
you
this
weapon
Which
I
have
here
recoverd
from
the
Moor
Come
guard
the
door
without
let
him
not
pass
But
kill
him
rather
Ill
after
that
same
villain
For
tis
a
damned
slave
I
am
not
valiant
neither
But
every
puny
whipster
gets
my
sword
But
why
should
honor
outlive
honesty
Let
it
go
all
What
did
thy
song
bode
lady
Hark
canst
thou
hear
me
I
will
play
the
swan
And
die
in
music
Sings
Willow
willow
willow
Moor
she
was
chaste
she
loved
thee
cruel
Moor
So
come
my
soul
to
bliss
as
I
speak
true
So
speaking
as
I
think
I
die
I
die
Dies
I
have
another
weapon
in
this
chamber
It
is
a
sword
of
Spain
the
icebrooks
temper
here
it
is
Uncle
I
must
come
forth
Within
If
thou
attempt
it
it
will
cost
thee
dear
Thou
hast
no
weapon
and
perforce
must
suffer
Look
in
upon
me
then
and
speak
with
me
Or
naked
as
I
am
I
will
assault
thee
Reenter
Gratiano
What
is
the
matter
Behold
I
have
a
weapon
better
never
did
itself
sustain
Upon
a
soldiers
thigh
I
have
seen
the
day
That
with
this
little
arm
and
this
good
sword
I
have
made
my
way
through
more
impediments
Than
twenty
times
your
stop
But
vain
boast
Who
can
control
his
fate
Tis
not
so
now
Be
not
afraid
though
you
do
see
me
weapond
Here
is
my
journeys
end
here
is
my
butt
And
very
seamark
of
my
utmost
sail
Do
you
go
back
dismayd
Tis
a
lost
fear
Man
but
a
rush
against
Othellos
breast
And
he
retires
Where
should
Othello
go
Now
how
dost
thou
look
now
illstarrd
wench
Pale
as
thy
smock
When
we
shall
meet
at
compt
This
look
of
thine
will
hurl
my
soul
from
heaven
And
fiends
will
snatch
at
it
Cold
cold
my
girl
Even
like
thy
chastity
cursed
cursed
slave
Whip
me
ye
devils
From
the
possession
of
this
heavenly
sight
Blow
me
about
in
winds
Roast
me
in
sulphur
Wash
me
in
steepdown
gulfs
of
liquid
fire
Desdemon
dead
Desdemon
dead
Enter
Lodovico
Montano
Cassio
carried
in
a
chair
and
Officers
with
Iago
prisoner
Where
is
this
rash
and
most
unfortunate
man
Thats
he
that
was
Othello
Here
I
am
Where
is
that
viper
Bring
the
villain
forth
I
look
down
towards
his
feet
but
thats
a
fable
If
that
thou
best
a
devil
I
cannot
kill
thee
Wounds
Iago
Wrench
his
sword
from
him
I
bleed
sir
but
not
killd
I
am
not
sorry
neither
Ild
have
thee
live
For
in
my
sense
tis
happiness
to
die
thou
Othello
that
wert
once
so
good
Falln
in
the
practice
of
a
damned
slave
What
shall
be
said
to
thee
Why
anything
An
honorable
murtherer
if
you
will
For
nought
did
I
in
hate
but
all
in
honor
This
wretch
hath
part
confessd
his
villainy
Did
you
and
he
consent
in
Cassios
death
Ay
Dear
general
I
never
gave
you
cause
I
do
believe
it
and
I
ask
your
pardon
Will
you
I
pray
demand
that
demidevil
Why
he
hath
thus
ensnared
my
soul
and
body
Demand
me
nothing
what
you
know
you
know
From
this
time
forth
I
never
will
speak
word
What
not
to
pray
Torments
will
ope
your
lips
Well
thou
dost
best
Sir
you
shall
understand
what
hath
befalln
Which
as
I
think
you
know
not
Here
is
a
letter
Found
in
the
pocket
of
the
slain
Roderigo
And
here
another
The
one
of
them
imports
The
death
of
Cassio
to
be
undertook
By
Roderigo
villain
Most
heathenish
and
most
gross
Now
heres
another
discontented
paper
Found
in
his
pocket
too
and
this
it
seems
Roderigo
meant
to
have
sent
this
damned
villain
But
that
belike
Iago
in
the
interim
Came
in
and
satisfied
him
the
pernicious
caitiff
How
came
you
Cassio
by
that
handkerchief
That
was
my
wifes
I
found
it
in
my
chamber
And
he
himself
confessd
but
even
now
That
there
he
droppd
it
for
a
special
purpose
Which
wrought
to
his
desire
fool
fool
fool
There
is
besides
in
Roderigos
letter
How
he
upbraids
Iago
that
he
made
him
Brave
me
upon
the
watch
whereon
it
came
That
I
was
cast
And
even
but
now
he
spake
After
long
seeming
dead
Iago
hurt
him
Iago
set
him
on
You
must
forsake
this
room
and
go
with
us
Your
power
and
your
command
is
taken
off
And
Cassio
rules
in
Cyprus
For
this
slave
If
there
be
any
cunning
cruelty
That
can
torment
him
much
and
hold
him
long
It
shall
be
his
You
shall
close
prisoner
rest
Till
that
the
nature
of
your
fault
be
known
To
the
Venetian
state
Come
bring
away
Soft
you
a
word
or
two
before
you
go
I
have
done
the
state
some
service
and
they
knowt
No
more
of
that
I
pray
you
in
your
letters
When
you
shall
these
unlucky
deeds
relate
Speak
of
me
as
I
am
nothing
extenuate
Nor
set
down
aught
in
malice
Then
must
you
speak
Of
one
that
loved
not
wisely
but
too
well
Of
one
not
easily
jealous
but
being
wrought
Perplexd
in
the
extreme
of
one
whose
hand
Like
the
base
Indian
threw
a
pearl
away
Richer
than
all
his
tribe
of
one
whose
subdued
eyes
Albeit
unused
to
the
melting
mood
Drop
tears
as
fast
as
the
Arabian
trees
Their
medicinal
gum
Set
you
down
this
And
say
besides
that
in
Aleppo
once
Where
a
malignant
and
a
turband
Turk
Beat
a
Venetian
and
traduced
the
state
I
took
by
the
throat
the
circumcised
dog
And
smote
him
thus
Stabs
himself
bloody
period
All
thats
spoke
is
marrd
I
kissd
thee
ere
I
killd
thee
No
way
but
this
Killing
myself
to
die
upon
a
kiss
Falls
on
the
bed
and
dies
This
did
I
fear
but
thought
he
had
no
weapon
For
he
was
great
of
heart
To
Iago
Spartan
dog
More
fell
than
anguish
hunger
or
the
sea
Look
on
the
tragic
loading
of
this
bed
This
is
thy
work
The
object
poisons
sight
Let
it
be
hid
Gratiano
keep
the
house
And
seize
upon
the
fortunes
of
the
Moor
For
they
succeed
on
you
To
you
Lord
Governor
Remains
the
censure
of
this
hellish
villain
The
time
the
place
the
torture
enforce
it
Myself
will
straight
aboard
and
to
the
state
This
heavy
act
with
heavy
heart
relate
I
I
London
The
palace
Enter
with
other
and
attendants
Old
John
of
Gaunt
timehonoured
Lancaster
Hast
thou
according
to
thy
oath
and
band
Brought
hither
Henry
Hereford
thy
bold
son
Here
to
make
good
the
boistrous
late
appeal
Which
then
our
leisure
would
not
let
us
hear
Against
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
Thomas
Mowbray
I
have
my
liege
Tell
me
moreover
hast
thou
sounded
him
If
he
appeal
the
Duke
on
ancient
malice
Or
worthily
as
a
good
subject
should
On
some
known
ground
of
treachery
in
him
As
near
as
I
could
sift
him
on
that
argument
On
some
apparent
danger
seen
in
him
Aimd
at
your
Highnessno
inveterate
malice
Then
call
them
to
our
presence
face
to
face
And
frowning
brow
to
brow
ourselves
will
hear
The
accuser
and
the
accused
freely
speak
Highstomachd
are
they
both
and
full
of
ire
In
rage
deaf
as
the
sea
hasty
as
fire
Enter
and
Many
years
of
happy
days
befall
My
gracious
sovereign
my
most
loving
liege
Each
day
still
better
others
happiness
Until
the
heavens
envying
earths
good
hap
Add
an
immortal
title
to
your
crown
We
thank
you
both
yet
one
but
flatters
us
As
well
appeareth
by
the
cause
you
come
Namely
to
appeal
each
other
of
high
treason
Cousin
of
Hereford
what
dost
thou
object
Against
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
Thomas
Mowbray
Firstheaven
be
the
record
to
my
speech
In
the
devotion
of
a
subjects
love
Tendring
the
precious
safety
of
my
prince
And
free
from
other
misbegotten
hate
Come
I
appellant
to
this
princely
presence
Now
Thomas
Mowbray
do
I
turn
to
thee
And
mark
my
greeting
well
for
what
I
speak
My
body
shall
make
good
upon
this
earth
Or
my
divine
soul
answer
it
in
heaven
Thou
art
a
traitor
and
a
miscreant
Too
good
to
be
so
and
too
bad
to
live
Since
the
more
fair
and
crystal
is
the
sky
The
uglier
seem
the
clouds
that
in
it
fly
Once
more
the
more
to
aggravate
the
note
With
a
foul
traitors
name
stuff
I
thy
throat
And
wishso
please
my
sovereignere
I
move
What
my
tongue
speaks
my
right
drawn
sword
may
prove
Let
not
my
cold
words
here
accuse
my
zeal
Tis
not
the
trial
of
a
womans
war
The
bitter
clamour
of
two
eager
tongues
Can
arbitrate
this
cause
betwixt
us
twain
The
blood
is
hot
that
must
be
coold
for
this
Yet
can
I
not
of
such
tame
patience
boast
As
to
be
hushd
and
nought
at
an
to
say
First
the
fair
reverence
of
your
Highness
curbs
me
From
giving
reins
and
spurs
to
my
free
speech
Which
else
would
post
until
it
had
returnd
These
terms
of
treason
doubled
down
his
throat
Setting
aside
his
high
bloods
royalty
And
let
him
be
no
kinsman
to
my
liege
I
do
defy
him
and
I
spit
at
him
Call
him
a
slanderous
coward
and
a
villain
Which
to
maintain
I
would
allow
him
odds
And
meet
him
were
I
tied
to
run
afoot
Even
to
the
frozen
ridges
of
the
Alps
Or
any
other
ground
inhabitable
Where
ever
Englishman
durst
set
his
foot
Meantime
let
this
defend
my
loyalty
By
all
my
hopes
most
falsely
doth
he
lie
Pale
trembling
coward
there
I
throw
my
gage
Disclaiming
here
the
kindred
of
the
King
And
lay
aside
my
high
bloods
royalty
Which
fear
not
reverence
makes
thee
to
except
If
guilty
dread
have
left
thee
so
much
strength
As
to
take
up
mine
honours
pawn
then
stoop
By
that
and
all
the
rites
of
knighthood
else
Will
I
make
good
against
thee
arm
to
arm
What
I
have
spoke
or
thou
canst
worst
devise
I
take
it
up
and
by
that
sword
I
swear
Which
gently
laid
my
knighthood
on
my
shoulder
Ill
answer
thee
in
any
fair
degree
Or
chivalrous
design
of
knightly
trial
And
when
I
mount
alive
may
I
not
light
If
I
be
traitor
or
unjustly
fight
What
doth
our
cousin
lay
to
Mowbrays
charge
It
must
be
great
that
can
inherit
us
So
much
as
of
a
thought
of
ill
in
him
Look
what
I
speak
my
life
shall
prove
it
true
That
Mowbray
hath
receivd
eight
thousand
nobles
In
name
of
lendings
for
your
Highness
soldiers
The
which
he
hath
detaind
for
lewd
employments
Like
a
false
traitor
and
injurious
villain
Besides
I
say
and
will
in
battle
prove
Or
here
or
elsewhere
to
the
furthest
verge
That
ever
was
surveyd
by
English
eye
That
all
the
treasons
for
these
eighteen
years
Complotted
and
contrived
in
this
land
Fetch
from
false
Mowbray
their
first
head
and
spring
Further
I
say
and
further
will
maintain
Upon
his
bad
life
to
make
all
this
good
That
he
did
plot
the
Duke
of
Gloucesters
death
Suggest
his
soonbelieving
adversaries
And
consequently
like
a
traitor
coward
Sluicd
out
his
innocent
soul
through
streams
of
blood
Which
blood
like
sacrificing
Abels
cries
Even
from
the
tongueless
caverns
of
the
earth
To
me
for
justice
and
rough
chastisement
And
by
the
glorious
worth
of
my
descent
This
arm
shall
do
it
or
this
life
be
spent
How
high
a
pitch
his
resolution
soars
Thomas
of
Norfolk
what
sayst
thou
to
this
let
my
sovereign
turn
away
his
face
And
bid
his
ears
a
little
while
be
deaf
Till
I
have
told
this
slander
of
his
blood
How
God
and
good
men
hate
so
foul
a
liar
Mowbray
impartial
are
our
eyes
and
cars
Were
he
my
brother
nay
my
kingdoms
heir
As
he
is
but
my
fathers
brothers
son
Now
by
my
sceptres
awe
I
make
a
vow
Such
neighbour
nearness
to
our
sacred
blood
Should
nothing
privilege
him
nor
partialize
The
unstooping
firmness
of
my
upright
soul
He
is
our
subject
Mowbray
so
art
thou
Free
speech
and
fearless
I
to
thee
allow
Then
Bolingbroke
as
low
as
to
thy
heart
Through
the
false
passage
of
thy
throat
thou
liest
Three
parts
of
that
receipt
I
had
for
Calais
Disbursd
I
duly
to
his
Highness
soldiers
The
other
part
reservd
I
by
consent
For
that
my
sovereign
liege
was
in
my
debt
Upon
remainder
of
a
dear
account
Since
last
I
went
to
France
to
fetch
his
queen
Now
swallow
down
that
lie
For
Gloucesters
death
I
slew
him
not
but
to
my
own
disgrace
Neglected
my
sworn
duty
in
that
case
For
you
my
noble
Lord
of
Lancaster
The
honourable
father
to
my
foe
Once
did
I
lay
an
ambush
for
your
life
trespass
that
doth
vex
my
grieved
soul
But
ere
I
last
receivd
the
sacrament
I
did
confess
it
and
exactly
beggd
Your
Graces
pardon
and
I
hope
I
had
it
This
is
my
fault
As
for
the
rest
appeald
It
issues
from
the
rancour
of
a
villain
recreant
and
most
degenerate
traitor
Which
in
myself
I
boldly
will
defend
And
interchangeably
hurl
down
my
gage
Upon
this
overweening
traitors
foot
To
prove
myself
a
loyal
gentleman
Even
in
the
best
blood
chamberd
in
his
bosom
In
haste
whereof
most
heartily
I
pray
Your
Highness
to
assign
our
trial
day
Wrathkindled
gentlemen
be
ruld
by
me
Lets
purge
this
choler
without
letting
blood
This
we
prescribe
though
no
physician
Deep
malice
makes
too
deep
incision
Forget
forgive
conclude
and
be
agreed
Our
doctors
say
this
is
no
month
to
bleed
Good
uncle
let
this
end
where
it
begun
Well
calm
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
you
your
son
To
be
a
makepeace
shall
become
my
age
Throw
down
my
son
the
Duke
of
Norfolks
gage
And
Norfolk
throw
down
his
When
Harry
when
Obedience
bids
I
should
not
bid
again
Norfolk
throw
down
we
bid
There
is
no
boot
Myself
I
throw
dread
sovereign
at
thy
foot
My
life
thou
shalt
command
but
not
my
shame
The
one
my
duty
owes
but
my
fair
name
Despite
of
death
that
lives
upon
my
grave
To
dark
dishonours
use
thou
shalt
not
have
I
am
disgracd
impeachd
and
baffld
here
Piercd
to
the
soul
with
slanders

The
which
no
balm
can
cure
but
his

Which
breathd
this
poison
Rage
must
be
withstood
Give
me
his
gagelions

leopards
tame
Yea
but
not

his
spots
Take
but
my
shame
And
I
resign
my

My

The
purest
treasure

Is
spotless

Men

Mine
honour
is
my

in
one
Take
honour
from
me
and
my
life
is
done
Then
dear
my
liege

honour
let
me
try
In
that
I

for
that
will
I
die
Cousin

God
defend
my
soul
from
such
deep
sin
Shall
I
seem
crestfallen
in
my
fathers
sight
Or
with
pale
beggarfear
impeach
my
height
Before
this
outdard
dastard
Ere
my
tongue
Shall
wound
my
honour
with
such
feeble
wrong
Or
sound
so
base
a
parle
my
teeth
shall
tear
The
slavish
motive
of
recanting
fear
And
spit
it
bleeding
in
his
high
disgrace
Where
shame
doth
harbour
even
in
Mowbrays
face
We
were
not
born
to
sue
but
to
command
Which
since
we
cannot
do
to
make
you
friends
Be
ready
as
your
lives
shall
answer
it
At
Coventry
upon
Saint
Lamberts
day
There
shall
your

The

of

To

And

Even

lusty
haviour
of
his

God
in
thy
good
cause
make
thee
prosperous
Be
swift
like
lightning
in
the
execution
And

redoubled
Fall

Of
thy
adverse
pernicious
enemy
Rouse

Mine

Never

freer
heart
Cast

and
embrace
His
golden
uncontrolld
enfranchisement
More
than
my
dancing
soul
doth
celebrate
This
feast
of
battle
with
mine
adversary
Most
mighty
liege
and
my
companion
peers
Take
from
my
mouth
the
wish
of
happy
years
As
gentle
and
as
jocund
as
to
jest
Go

to
fight

breast
Farewell
my
lord
securely
I
espy
Virtue
with
valour
couched
in
thine
eye
Order
the
trial
Marshal
and
begin
Harry
of
Hereford
Lancaster
and
Derby
Receive
thy
lance
and
God
defend
the
right
Strong
as
a
tower
in
hope
I
cry
amen
To
an
officer
Go
bear
this
lance
to
Thomas
Duke
of
Norfolk
Harry
of
Hereford
Lancaster
and
Derby
Stands
here
for
God
his
sovereign
and
himself
On
pain
to
be
found
false
and
recreant
To
prove
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
Thomas
Mowbray
traitor
to
his
God
his
King
and
him
And
dares
him
to
set
forward
to
the
fight
Here
standeth
Thomas
Mowbray
Duke
of
Norfolk
On
pain
to
be
found
false
and
recreant
Both
to
defend
himself
and
to
approve
Henry
of
Hereford
Lancaster
and
Derby
To
God
his
sovereign
and
to
him
disloyal
Courageously
and
with
a
free
desire
Attending
but
the
signal
to
begin
Sound
trumpets
and
set
forward
combatants
charge
sounded
Stay
the
King
hath
thrown
his
warder
down
Let
them
lay
by
their
helmets
and
their
spears
And
both
return
back
to
their
chairs
again
Withdraw
with
us
and
let
the
trumpets
sound
While
we
return
these
dukes
what
we
decree
long
flourish
while
the
consults
his
Council
Draw
near
And
list
what
with
our
council
we
have
done
For
that
our
kingdoms
earth
should
not
be
soild
With
that
dear
blood
which
it
hath
fostered
And
for
our
eyes
do
hate
the
dire
aspect
Of
civil
wounds
ploughd
up
with
neighbours
sword
And
for
we
think
the
eaglewinged
pride
Of
skyaspiring
and
ambitious
thoughts
With
rivalhating
envy
set
on
you
To
wake
our
peace
which
in
our
countrys
cradle
Draws
the
sweet
infant
breath
of
gentle
sleep
Which
so
rousd
up
with
boistrous
untund
drums
With
harshresounding
trumpets
dreadful
bray
And
grating
shock
of
wrathful
iron
arms
Might
from
our
quiet
confines
fright
fair
peace
And
make
us
wade
even
in
our
kindreds
blood
Therefore
we
banish
you
our
territories
You
cousin
Hereford
upon
pain
of
life
Till
twice
five
summers
have
enrichd
our
fields
Shall
not
regreet
our
fair
dominions
But
tread
the
stranger
paths
of
banishment
Your
will
be
done
This
must
my
comfort
be
That
sun
that
warms
you
here
shall
shine
on
me
And
those
his
golden
beams
to
you
here
lent
Shall
point
on
me
and
gild
my
banishment
Norfolk
for
thee
remains
a
heavier
doom
Which
I
with
some
unwillingness
pronounce
The
sly
slow
hours
shall
not
determinate
The
dateless
limit
of
thy
dear
exile
The
hopeless
word
of
never
to
return
Breathe
I
against
thee
upon
pain
of
life
heavy
sentence
my
most
sovereign
liege
And
all
unlookd
for
from
your
Highness
mouth
dearer
merit
not
so
deep
a
maim
As
to
be
cast
forth
in
the
common
air
Have
I
deserved
at
your
Highness
hands
The
language
I
have
learnt
these
forty
years
My
native
English
now
I
must
forgo
And
now
my
tongues
use
is
to
me
no
more
Than
an
unstringed
viol
or
a
harp
Or
like
a
cunning
instrument
casd
up
Or
being
open
put
into
his
hands
That
knows
no
touch
to
tune
the
harmony
Within
my
mouth
you
have
engaold
my
tongue
Doubly
portcullisd
with
my
teeth
and
lips
And
dull
unfeeling
barren
ignorance
Is
made
my
gaoler
to
attend
on
me
I
am
too
old
to
fawn
upon
a
nurse
Too
far
in
years
to
be
a
pupil
now
What
is
thy
sentence
then
but
speechless
death
Which
robs
my
tongue
from
breathing
native
breath
It
boots
thee
not
to
be
compassionate
After
our
sentence
plaining
comes
too
late
Then
thus
I
turn
me
from
my
countrvs
light
To
dwell
in
solemn
shades
of
endless
night
Return
again
and
take
an
oath
with
thee
Lay
on
our
royal
sword
your
banishd
hands
Swear
by
the
duty
that
you
owe
to
God
Our
part
therein
we
banish
with
yourselves
To
keep
the
oath
that
we
administer
You
never
shall
so
help
you
truth
and
God
Embrace
each
others
love
in
banishment
Nor
never
look
upon
each
others
face
Nor
never
write
regreet
nor
reconcile
This
louring
tempest
of
your
homebred
hate
Nor
never
by
advised
purpose
meet
To
plot
contrive
or
complot
any
ill
Gainst
us
our
state
our
subjects
or
our
land
I
swear
And
I
to
keep
all
this
Norfolk
so
far
as
to
mine
enemy
By
this
time
had
the
King
permitted
us
One
of
our
souls
had
wandred
in
the
air
Banishd
this
frail
sepulchre
of
our
flesh
As
now
our
flesh
is
banishd
from
this
land
Confess
thy
treasons
ere
thou
fly
the
realm
Since
thou
hast
far
to
go
bear
not
along
The
clogging
burden
of
a
guilty
soul
No
Bolingbroke
if
ever
I
were
traitor
My
name
be
blotted
from
the
book
of
life
And
I
from
heaven
banishd
as
from
hence
But
what
thou
art
God
thou
and
I
do
know
And
all
too
soon
I
fear
the
King
shall
rue
Farewell
my
liege
Now
no
way
can
I
stray
Save
back
to
England
an
the
worlds
my
way
Uncle
even
in
the
glasses
of
thine
eyes
I
see
thy
grieved
heart
Thy
sad
aspect
Hath
from
the
number
of
his
banishd
years
Pluckd
four
away
To
Six
frozen
winters
spent
Return
with
welcome
home
from
banishment
How
long
a
time
lies
in
one
little
word
Four
lagging
winters
and
four
wanton
springs
End
in
a
word
such
is
the
breath
of
Kings
I
thank
my
liege
that
in
regard
of
me
He
shortens
four
years
of
my
sons
exile
But
little
vantage
shall
I
reap
thereby
For
ere
the
six
years
that
he
hath
to
spend
Can
change
their
moons
and
bring
their
times
about
My
oildried
lamp
and
timebewasted
light
Shall
be
extinct
with
age
and
endless
night
My
inch
of
taper
will
be
burnt
and
done
And
blindfold
death
not
let
me
see
my
son
Why
uncle
thou
hast
many
years
to
live
But
not
a
minute
King
that
thou
canst
give
Shorten
my
days
thou
canst
with
sullen
sorrow
And
pluck
nights
from
me
but
not
lend
a
morrow
Thou
canst
help
time
to
furrow
me
with
age
But
stop
no
wrinkle
in
his
pilgrimage
Thy
word
is
current
with
him
for
my
death
But
dead
thy
kingdom
cannot
buy
my
breath
Thy
son
is
banishd
upon
good
advice
Whereto
thy
tongue
a
partyverdict
gave
Why
at
our
justice
seemst
thou
then
to
lour
Things
sweet
to
taste
prove
in
digestion
sour
You
urgd
me
as
a
judge
but
I
had
rather
You
would
have
bid
me
argue
like
a
father
had
it
been
a
stranger
not
my
child
To
smooth
his
fault
I
should
have
been
more
mild
partial
slander
sought
I
to
avoid
And
in
the
sentence
my
own
life
destroyd
Alas
I
lookd
when
some
of
you
should
say
I
was
too
strict
to
make
mine
own
away
But
you
gave
leave
to
my
unwilling
tongue
Against
my
will
to
do
myself
this
wrong
Cousin
farewell
and
uncle
bid
him
so
Six
years
we
banish
him
and
he
shall
go
Flourish
Cousin
farewell
what
presence
must
not
know
From
where
you
do
remain
let
paper
show
My
lord
no
leave
take
I
for
I
will
ride
As
far
as
land
will
let
me
by
your
side
to
what
purpose
dost
thou
hoard
thy
words
That
thou
returnest
no
greeting
to
thy
friends
I
have
too
few
to
take
my
leave
of
you
When
the
tongues
office
should
be
prodigal
To
breathe
the
abundant
dolour
of
the
heart
Thy
grief
is
but
thy
absence
for
a
time
Joy
absent
grief
is
present
for
that
time
What
is
six
winters
They
are
quickly
gone
To
men
in
joy
but
grief
makes
one
hour
ten
Call
it
a
travel
that
thou
takst
for
pleasure
My
heart
will
sigh
when
I
miscall
it
so
Which
finds
it
an
enforced
pilgrimage
The
sullen
passage
of
thy
weary
steps
Esteem
as
foil
wherein
thou
art
to
set
The
precious
jewel
of
thy
home
return
Nay
rather
every
tedious
stride
I
make
Will
but
remember
me
what
a
deal
of
world
I
wander
from
the
jewels
that
I
love
Must
I
not
serve
a
long
apprenticehood
To
foreign
passages
and
in
the
end
Having
my
freedom
boast
of
nothing
else
But
that
I
was
a
journeyman
to
grief
All
places
that
the
eye
of
heaven
visits
Are
to
a
wise
man
ports
and
happy
havens
Teach
thy
necessity
to
reason
thus
There
is
no
virtue
like
necessity
Think
not
the
King
did
banish
thee
But
thou
the
King
Woe
doth
the
heavier
sit
Where
it
perceives
it
is
but
faintly
home
Go
say
I
sent
thee
forth
to
purchase
honour
And
not
the
King
exild
thee
or
suppose
Devouring
pestilence
hangs
in
our
air
And
thou
art
flying
to
a
fresher
clime
Look
what
thy
soul
holds
dear
imagine
it
To
lie
that
way
thou
goest
not
whence
thou
comst
Suppose
the
singing
birds
musicians
The
grass
whereon
thou
treadst
the
presence
strewd
The
flowers
fair
ladies
and
thy
steps
no
more
Than
a
delightful
measure
or
a
dance
For
gnarling
sorrow
hath
less
power
to
bite
The
man
that
mocks
at
it
and
sets
it
light
who
can
hold
a
fire
in
his
hand
By
thinking
on
the
frosty
Caucasus
Or
cloy
the
hungry
edge
of
appetite
By
bare
imagination
of
a
feast
Or
wallow
naked
in
December
snow
By
thinking
on
fantastic
summers
heat
no
the
apprehension
of
the
good
Gives
but
the
greater
feeling
to
the
worse
Fell
sorrows
tooth
doth
never
rankle
more
Than
when
he
bites
but
lanceth
not
the
sore
Come
come
my
son
Ill
bring
thee
on
thy
way
Had
I
thy
youtli
and
cause
I
would
not
stay
Then
Englands
ground
farewell
sweet
soil
adieu
My
mother
and
my
nurse
that
bears
me
yet
Whereer
I
wander
boast
of
this
I
can
Though
banishd
yet
a
trueborn
English
man
Madam
your
Majesty
is
too
much
sad
You
promisd
when
you
parted
with
the
King
To
lay
aside
lifeharming
heaviness
And
entertain
a
cheerful
disposition
To
please
the
King
I
did
to
please
myself
I
cannot
do
it
yet
I
know
no
cause
Why
I
should
welcome
such
a
guest
as
grief
Save
bidding
farewell
to
so
sweet
a
guest
As
my
sweet
Richard
Yet
again
methinks
Some
unborn
sorrow
ripe
in
fortunes
womb
Is
coming
towards
me
and
my
inward
soul
With
nothing
trembles
At
some
thing
it
grieves
More
than
with
parting
from
my
lord
the
King
Each
substance
of
a
grief
hath
twenty
shadows
Which
shows
like
grief
itself
but
is
not
so
For
sorrows
eye
glazed
with
blinding
tears
Divides
one
thing
entire
to
many
objects
Like
perspectives
which
rightly
gazd
upon
Show
nothing
but
confusioneyd
awry
Distinguish
form
So
your
sweet
Majesty
Looking
awry
upon
your
lords
departure
Find
shapes
of
grief
more
than
himself
to
wail
Which
lookd
on
as
it
is
is
nought
but
shadows
Of
what
it
is
not
Then
thricegracious
Queen
More
than
your
lords
departure
weep
notmore
is
not
seen
Or
if
it
be
tis
with
false
sorrows
eye
Which
for
things
true
weeps
things
imaginary
It
may
be
so
but
yet
my
inward
soul
Persuades
me
it
is
otherwise
Howeer
it
be
I
cannot
but
be
sad
so
heavy
sad
Asthough
on
thinking
on
no
thought
I
think
Makes
me
with
heavy
nothing
faint
and
shrink
Tis
nothing
but
conceit
my
gracious
lady
Tis
nothing
less
conceit
is
still
derivd
From
some
forefather
grief
mine
is
not
so
For
nothing
hath
begot
my
something
grief
Or
something
hath
the
nothing
that
I
grieve
Tis
in
reversion
that
I
do
possess
But
what
it
is
that
is
not
yet
known
what
I
cannot
name
tis
nameless
woe
I
wot
Enter
God
save
your
Majesty
and
well
met
gentlemen
I
hope
the
King
is
not
yet
shippd
for
Ireland
Why
hopest
thou
so
Tis
better
hope
he
is
For
his
designs
crave
haste
his
haste
good
hope
Then
wherefore
dost
thou
hope
he
is
not
shippd
That
he
our
hope
might
have
retird
his
power
And
driven
into
despair
an
enemys
hope
Who
strongly
hath
set
footing
in
this
land
The
banishd
Bolingbroke
repeals
himself
And
with
uplifted
arms
is
safe
arrivd
At
Ravenspurgh
Now
God
in
heaven
forbid
Ah
madam
tis
too
true
and
that
is
worse
The
Lord
Northumberland
his
son
young
Henry
Percy
The
Lords
of
Ross
Beaumond
and
Willoughby
With
all
their
powerful
friends
are
fled
to
him
Why
have
you
not
proclaimd
Northumberland
And
all
the
rest
revolted
faction
traitors
We
have
whereupon
the
Earl
of
Worcester
Hath
broken
his
staff
resignd
his
stewardship
And
all
the
household
servants
fled
with
him
To
Bolingbroke
So
Green
thou
art
the
midwife
to
my
woe
And
Bolingbroke
my
sorrows
dismal
heir
Now
hath
my
soul
brought
forth
her
prodigy
And
I
a
gasping
newdeliverd
mother
Have
woe
to
woe
sorrow
to
sorrow
joind
Despair
not
madam
Who
shall
hinder
me
I
will
despair
and
be
at
enmity
With
cozening
hopehe
is
a
flatterer
parasite
a
keeperback
of
death
Who
gently
would
dissolve
the
bands
of
life
Which
false
hope
lingers
in
extremity
Enter
Here
comes
the
Duke
of
York
With
signs
of
war
about
his
aged
neck
full
of
careful
business
are
his
looks
Uncle
for
Gods
sake
speak
comfortable
words
Should
I
do
so
I
should
belie
my
thoughts
Comforts
in
heaven
and
we
are
on
the
earth
Where
nothing
lives
but
crosses
cares
and
grief
Your
husband
he
is
gone
to
save
far
off
Whilst
others
come
to
make
him
lose
at
home
Here
am
I
left
to
underprop
his
land
Who
weak
with
age
cannot
support
myself
Now
comes
the
sick
hour
that
his
surfeit
made
Now
shall
he
try
his
friends
that
flatterd
him
Enter
a
My
lord
your
son
was
gone
before
I
came
He
waswhy
so
go
all
which
way
it
will
The
nobles
they
are
fled
the
commons
they
are
cold
And
will
I
fear
revolt
on
Herefords
side
Sirrah
get
thee
to
Plashy
to
my
sister
Gloucester
Bid
her
send
me
presently
a
thousand
pound
Hold
take
my
ring
My
lord
I
had
forgot
to
tell
your
lordship
Today
as
I
came
by
I
called
there
But
I
shall
grieve
you
to
report
the
rest
What
ist
knave
An
hour
before
I
came
the
Duchess
died
God
for
his
mercy
what
a
tide
of
woes
Comes
rushing
on
this
woeful
land
at
once
I
know
not
what
to
do
I
would
to
God
So
my
untruth
had
not
provokd
him
to
it
The
King
had
cut
off
my
head
with
my
brothers
What
are
there
no
posts
dispatchd
for
Ireland
How
shall
we
do
for
money
for
these
wars
Come
sistercousin
I
would
saypray
pardon
me
Go
fellow
get
thee
home
provide
some
carts
And
bring
away
the
armour
that
is
there
Gentlemen
will
you
go
muster
men
If
I
know
how
or
which
way
to
order
these
affairs
Thus
disorderly
thrust
into
my
hands
Never
believe
me
Both
are
my
kinsmen
Tone
is
my
sovereign
whom
both
my
oath
And
duty
bids
defend
tother
again
Is
my
kinsman
whom
the
King
hath
wrongd
Whom
conscience
and
my
kindred
bids
to
right
Well
somewhat
we
must
doCome
cousin
Ill
dispose
of
you
Gentlemen
go
muster
up
your
men
And
meet
me
presently
at
Berkeley
I
should
to
Plashy
too
But
time
will
not
permit
All
is
uneven
And
everything
is
left
at
six
and
seven
The
wind
sits
fair
for
news
to
go
to
Ireland
But
none
returns
For
us
to
levy
power
Proportionable
to
the
enemy
Is
all
unpossible
Besides
our
nearness
to
the
King
in
love
Is
near
the
hate
of
those
love
not
the
King
And
that
is
the
wavering
commons
for
their
love
Lies
in
their
purses
and
whoso
empties
them
By
so
much
fills
their
hearts
with
deadly
hate
Wherein
the
King
stands
generally
condemnd
If
judgment
lie
in
them
then
so
do
we
Because
we
ever
have
been
near
the
King
Well
I
will
for
refuge
straight
to
Bristow
Castle
The
Earl
of
Wiltshire
is
already
there
Thither
will
I
with
you
for
little
office
Will
the
hateful
commons
perform
for
us
Except
Eke
curs
to
tear
us
all
to
pieces
Will
you
go
along
with
us
No
I
will
to
Ireland
to
his
Majesty
Farewell
If
hearts
presages
be
not
vain
We
three
here
part
that
neer
shall
meet
again
Thats
as
York
thrives
to
beat
back
Bolingbroke
Alas
poor
Duke
the
task
he
undertakes
Is
numbring
sands
and
drinking
oceans
dry
Where
one
on
his
side
fights
thousands
will
fly
Farewell
at
oncefor
once
for
all
and
ever
Well
we
may
meet
again
I
fear
me
never
camp
in
Wales
Enter
and
a
My
Lord
of
Salisbury
we
have
stayd
ten
days
And
hardly
kept
our
countrymen
together
And
yet
we
hear
no
tidings
from
the
King
Therefore
we
will
disperse
ourselves
Farewell
Stay
yet
another
day
thou
trusty
Welshman
The
King
reposeth
all
his
confidence
in
thee
Tis
thought
the
King
is
dead
we
will
not
stay
The
bay
trees
in
our
country
are
all
witherd
And
meteors
fright
the
fixed
stars
of
heaven
The
palefacd
moon
looks
bloody
on
the
earth
And
leanlookd
prophets
whisper
fearful
change
Rich
men
look
sad
and
ruffians
dance
and
leap
The
one
in
fear
to
lose
what
they
enjoy
The
other
to
enjoy
by
rage
and
war
These
signs
forerun
the
death
or
fall
of
kings
Farewell
Our
countrymen
are
gone
and
fled
As
well
assurd
Richard
their
King
is
dead
Ah
Richard
with
the
eyes
of
heavy
mind
I
see
thy
glory
like
a
shooting
star
Fall
to
the
base
earth
from
the
firmament
The
sun
sets
weeping
in
the
lowly
west
Witnessing
storms
to
come
woe
and
unrest
Thy
friends
are
fled
to
wait
upon
thy
foes
And
crossly
to
thy
good
all
fortune
goes
I
camp
at
Bristol
Enter
and
prisoners
Bring
forth
these
men
Bushy
and
Green
I
will
not
vex
your
souls
Since
presently
your
souls
must
part
your
bodies
With
too
much
urging
your
pernicious
lives
For
twere
no
charity
yet
to
wash
your
blood
From
off
my
hands
here
in
the
view
of
men
I
will
unfold
some
causes
of
your
deaths
You
have
misled
a
prince
a
royal
king
happy
gentleman
in
blood
and
lineaments
By
you
unhappied
and
disfigured
clean
You
have
in
manner
with
your
sinful
hours
Made
a
divorce
betwixt
his
queen
and
him
Broke
the
possession
of
a
royal
bed
And
staind
the
beauty
of
a
fair
queens
cheeks
With
tears
drawn
from
her
eyes
by
your
foul
wrongs
Myselfa
prince
by
fortune
of
my
birth
Near
to
the
King
in
blood
and
near
in
love
Till
you
did
make
him
misinterpret
me
Have
stoopd
my
neck
under
your
injuries
And
sighd
my
English
breath
in
foreign
clouds
Eating
the
bitter
bread
of
banishment
Whilst
you
have
fed
upon
my
signories
Disparkd
my
parks
and
felld
my
forest
woods
From
my
own
windows
torn
my
household
coat
Razd
out
my
imprese
leaving
me
no
sign
Save
mens
opinions
and
my
living
blood
To
show
the
world
I
am
a
gentleman
This
and
much
more
much
more
than
twice
all
this
Condemns
you
to
the
death
See
them
delivered
over
To
execution
and
the
hand
of
death
More
welcome
is
the
stroke
of
death
to
me
Than
Bolingbroke
to
England
Lords
farewell
My
comfort
is
that
heaven
will
take
our
souls
And
plague
injustice
with
the
pains
of
hell
My
Lord
Northumberland
see
them
dispatchd
Uncle
you
say
the
Queen
is
at
your
house
For
Gods
sake
fairly
let
her
be
entreated
Tell
her
I
send
to
her
my
kind
commends
Take
special
care
my
greetings
be
delivered
gentleman
of
mine
I
have
dispatchd
With
letters
of
your
love
to
her
at
large
Thanks
gentle
uncle
Come
lords
away
To
fight
with
Glendower
and
his
complices
Awhile
to
work
and
after
holiday
So
that
by
this
intelligence
we
learn
The
Welshmen
are
dispersd
and
Salisbury
Is
gone
to
meet
the
King
who
lately
landed
With
some
few
private
friends
upon
this
coast
The
news
is
very
fair
and
good
my
lord
Richard
not
far
from
hence
hath
hid
his
head
It
would
beseem
the
Lord
Northumberland
To
say
King
Richard
Alack
the
heavy
day
When
such
a
sacred
king
should
hide
his
head
Your
Grace
mistakes
only
to
be
brief
Left
I
his
title
out
The
time
hath
been
Would
you
have
been
so
brief
with
him
he
would
Have
been
so
brief
with
you
to
shorten
you
For
taking
so
the
head
your
whole
heads
length
Mistake
not
uncle
further
than
you
should
Take
not
good
cousin
further
than
you
should
Lest
you
mistake
The
heavens
are
over
our
heads
I
know
it
uncle
and
oppose
not
myself
Against
their
will
But
who
comes
here
Enter
Welcome
Harry
What
will
not
this
castle
yield
The
castle
royally
is
mannd
my
lord
Against
thy
entrance
Royally
Why
it
contains
no
king
Yes
my
good
lord
It
doth
contain
a
king
King
Richard
lies
Within
the
limits
of
yon
lime
and
stone
And
with
him
are
the
Lord
Aumerle
Lord
Salisbury
Sir
Stephen
Scroop
besides
a
clergyman
Of
holy
reverence
who
I
cannot
learn
belike
it
is
the
Bishop
of
Carlisle
To
Noble
lord
Go
to
the
rude
ribs
of
that
ancient
castle
Through
brazen
trumpet
send
the
breath
of
parley
Into
his
ruind
ears
and
thus
deliver
Henry
Bolingbroke
On
both
his
knees
doth
kiss
King
Richards
hand
And
sends
allegiance
and
true
faith
of
heart
To
his
most
royal
person
hither
come
Even
at
his
feet
to
lay
my
arms
and
power
Provided
that
my
banishment
repeald
And
lands
restord
again
be
freely
granted
If
not
Ill
use
the
advantage
of
my
power
And
lay
the
summers
dust
with
showers
of
blood
Raind
from
the
wounds
of
slaughtered
Englishmen
The
which
how
far
off
from
the
mind
of
Bolingbroke
It
is
such
crimson
tempest
should
bedrench
The
fresh
green
lap
of
fair
King
Richards
land
My
stooping
duty
tenderly
shall
show
Go
signify
as
much
while
here
we
march
Upon
the
grassy
carpet
of
this
plain
advances
to
the
Castle
with
a
trumpet
Lets
march
without
the
noise
of
threatning
drum
That
from
this
castles
tottered
battlements
Our
fair
appointments
may
be
well
perusd
Methinks
King
Richard
and
myself
should
meet
With
no
less
terror
than
the
elements
Of
fire
and
water
when
their
thundring
shock
At
meeting
tears
the
cloudy
cheeks
of
heaven
Be
he
the
fire
Ill
be
the
yielding
water
The
rage
be
his
whilst
on
the
earth
I
rain
My
waterson
the
earth
and
not
on
him
March
on
and
mark
King
Richard
how
he
looks
Parle
without
and
answer
within
then
a
flourish
Enter
on
the
walls
the
the
and
See
see
King
Richard
doth
himself
appear
As
doth
the
blushing
discontented
sun
From
out
the
fiery
portal
of
the
east
When
he
perceives
the
envious
clouds
are
bent
To
dim
his
glory
and
to
stain
the
track
Of
his
bright
passage
to
the
occident
Yet
he
looks
like
a
king
Behold
his
eye
As
bright
as
is
the
eagles
lightens
forth
Controlling
majesty
Alack
alack
for
woe
That
any
harm
should
stain
so
fair
a
show
To
We
are
amazd
and
thus
long
have
we
stood
To
watch
the
fearful
bending
of
thy
knee
Because
we
thought
ourself
thy
lawful
King
And
if
we
be
how
dare
thy
joints
forget
To
pay
their
awful
duty
to
our
presence
If
we
be
not
show
us
the
hand
of
God
That
hath
dismissd
us
from
our
stewardship
For
well
we
know
no
hand
of
blood
and
bone
Can
gripe
the
sacred
handle
of
our
sceptre
Unless
he
do
profane
steal
or
usurp
And
though
you
think
that
all
as
you
have
done
Have
torn
their
souls
by
turning
them
from
us
And
we
are
barren
and
bereft
of
friends
Yet
knowmy
master
God
omnipotent
Is
mustering
in
his
clouds
on
our
behalf
Armies
of
pestilence
and
they
shall
strike
Your
children
yet
unborn
and
unbegot
That
lift
your
vassal
hands
against
my
head
And
threat
the
glory
of
my
precious
crown
Tell
Bolingbroke
for
yon
methinks
he
stands
That
every
stride
he
makes
upon
my
land
Is
dangerous
treason
he
is
come
to
open
The
purple
testament
of
bleeding
war
But
ere
the
crown
he
looks
for
live
in
peace
Ten
thousand
bloody
crowns
of
mothers
sons
Shall
ill
become
the
flower
of
Englands
face
Change
the
complexion
of
her
maidpale
peace
To
scarlet
indignation
and
bedew
Her
pastures
grass
with
faithful
English
blood
The
King
of
Heaven
forbid
our
lord
the
King
Should
so
with
civil
and
uncivil
arms
Be
rushd
upon
Thy
thrice
noble
cousin
Harry
Bolingbroke
doth
humbly
kiss
thy
hand
And
by
the
honourable
tomb
he
swears
That
stands
upon
your
royal
grandsires
bones
And
by
the
royalties
of
both
your
bloods
Currents
that
spring
from
one
most
gracious
head
And
by
the
buried
hand
of
warlike
Gaunt
And
by
the
worth
and
honour
of
himself
Comprising
all
that
may
be
sworn
or
said
His
coming
hither
hath
no
further
scope
Than
for
his
lineal
royalties
and
to
beg
Enfranchisement
immediate
on
his
knees
Which
on
thy
royal
party
granted
once
His
glittering
arms
he
will
commend
to
rust
His
barbed
steeds
to
stables
and
his
heart
To
faithful
service
of
your
Majesty
This
swears
he
as
he
is
a
prince
is
just
And
as
I
am
a
gentleman
I
credit
him
Northumberland
say
thus
the
King
returns
His
noble
cousin
is
right
welcome
hither
And
all
the
number
of
his
fair
demands
Shall
be
accomplishd
without
contradiction
With
all
the
gracious
utterance
thou
hast
Speak
to
his
gentle
hearing
kind
commends
To
We
do
debase
ourselves
cousin
do
we
not
To
look
so
poorly
and
to
speak
so
fair
Shall
we
call
back
Northumberland
and
send
Defiance
to
the
traitor
and
so
die
No
good
my
lord
lets
fight
with
gentle
words
Till
time
lend
friends
and
friends
their
helpful
swords
God
God
that
eer
this
tongue
of
mine
That
laid
the
sentence
of
dread
banishment
On
yon
proud
man
should
take
it
off
again
With
words
of
sooth
that
I
were
as
great
As
is
my
grief
or
lesser
than
my
name
Or
that
I
could
forget
what
I
have
been
Or
not
remember
what
I
must
be
now
Swellst
thou
proud
heart
Ill
give
thee
scope
to
beat
Since
foes
have
scope
to
beat
both
thee
and
me
Northumberland
comes
back
from
Bolingbroke
What
must
the
King
do
now
Must
he
submit
The
King
shall
do
it
Must
he
be
deposd
The
King
shall
be
contented
Must
he
lose
The
name
of
king
Gods
name
let
it
go
Ill
give
my
jewels
for
a
set
of
beads
My
gorgeous
palace
for
a
hermitage
My
gay
apparel
for
an
almsmans
gown
My
figurd
goblets
for
a
dish
of
wood
My
sceptre
for
a
palmers
walking
staff
My
subjects
for
a
pair
of
carved
saints
And
my
large
kingdom
for
a
little
grave
little
little
grave
an
obscure
grave
Or
Ill
be
buried
in
the
kings
high
way
Some
way
of
common
trade
where
subjects
feet
May
hourly
trample
on
their
sovereigns
head
For
on
my
heart
they
tread
now
whilst
I
live
And
buried
once
why
not
upon
my
head
Aumerle
thou
weepst
my
tenderhearted
cousin
Well
make
foul
weather
with
despised
tears
Our
sighs
and
they
shall
lodge
the
summer
corn
And
make
a
dearth
in
this
revolting
land
Or
shall
we
play
the
wantons
with
our
woes
And
make
some
pretty
match
with
shedding
tears
As
thus
to
drop
them
still
upon
one
place
Till
they
have
fretted
us
a
pair
of
graves
Within
the
earth
and
therein
laidthere
lies
Two
kinsmen
diggd
their
graves
with
weeping
eyes
Would
not
this
ill
do
well
Well
well
I
see
I
talk
but
idly
and
you
laugh
at
me
Most
mighty
prince
my
Lord
Northumberland
What
says
King
Bolingbroke
Will
his
Majesty
Give
Richard
leave
to
live
till
Richard
die
You
make
a
leg
and
Bolingbroke
says
ay
My
lord
in
the
base
court
he
doth
attend
To
speak
with
you
may
it
please
you
to
come
down
Down
down
I
come
like
glistring
Phaethon
Wanting
the
manage
of
unruly
jades
In
the
base
court
Base
court
where
kings
grow
base
To
come
at
traitors
calls
and
do
them
grace
In
the
base
court
Come
down
Down
court
down
king
For
nightowls
shriek
where
mounting
larks
should
sing
What
says
his
Majesty
Sorrow
and
grief
of
heart
Makes
him
speak
fondly
like
a
frantic
man
Yet
he
is
come
Enter
the
and
his
attendants
below
Stand
all
apart
And
show
fair
duty
to
his
Majesty
He
kneels
down
My
gracious
lord
Fair
cousin
you
debase
your
princely
knee
To
make
the
base
earth
proud
with
kissing
it
Me
rather
had
my
heart
might
feel
your
love
Than
my
unpleasd
eye
see
your
courtesy
Up
cousin
up
your
heart
is
up
I
know
Touching
his
own
head
Thus
high
at
least
although
your
knee
be
low
My
gracious
lord
I
come
but
for
mine
own
Your
own
is
yours
and
I
am
yours
and
all
So
far
be
mine
my
most
redoubted
lord
As
my
true
service
shall
deserve
your
love
Well
you
deserve
They
well
deserve
to
have
That
know
the
strongst
and
surest
way
to
get
Uncle
give
me
your
hands
nay
dry
your
eyes
Tears
show
their
love
but
want
their
remedies
Cousin
I
am
too
young
to
be
your
father
Though
you
are
old
enough
to
be
my
heir
What
you
will
have
Ill
give
and
willing
too
For
do
we
must
what
force
will
have
us
do
Set
on
towards
London
Cousin
is
it
so
Yea
my
good
lord
Then
I
must
not
say
no
Flourish
My
Lord
you
told
me
you
would
tell
the
rest
When
weeping
made
you
break
the
story
off
Of
our
two
cousins
coming
into
London
Where
did
I
leave
At
that
sad
stop
my
lord
Where
rude
misgoverned
hands
from
windows
tops
Threw
dust
and
rubbish
on
King
Richards
head
Then
as
I
said
the
Duke
great
Bolingbroke
Mounted
upon
a
hot
and
fiery
steed
Which
his
aspiring
rider
seemd
to
know
With
slow
but
stately
pace
kept
on
his
course
Whilst
all
tongues
cried
God
save
thee
Bolingbroke
You
would
have
thought
the
very
windows
spake
So
many
greedy
looks
of
young
and
old
Through
casements
darted
their
desiring
eyes
Upon
his
visage
and
that
all
the
walls
With
painted
imagery
had
said
at
once
Jesu
preserve
thee
Welcome
Bolingbroke
Whilst
he
from
the
one
side
to
the
other
turning
Bareheaded
lower
than
his
proud
steeds
neck
Bespake
them
thus
I
thank
you
countrymen
And
thus
still
doing
thus
he
passd
along
Alack
poor
Richard
where
rode
he
the
whilst
As
in
a
theatre
the
eyes
of
men
After
a
wellgracd
actor
leaves
the
stage
Are
idly
bent
on
him
that
enters
next
Thinking
his
prattle
to
be
tedious
Even
so
or
with
much
more
contempt
mens
eyes
Did
scowl
on
gentle
Richard
no
man
cried
God
save
him
No
joyful
tongue
gave
him
his
welcome
home
But
dust
was
thrown
upon
his
sacred
head
Which
with
such
gentle
sorrow
he
shook
off
His
face
still
combating
with
tears
and
smiles
The
badges
of
his
grief
and
patience
That
had
not
God
for
some
strong
purpose
steeld
The
hearts
of
men
they
must
perforce
have
melted
And
barbarism
itself
have
pitied
him
But
heaven
hath
a
hand
in
these
events
To
whose
high
will
we

Which
for
some
reasons

I
mean

I
fear
What

entred

For

Bound

What
doth
he
with

That

Treason

His

Hence

Give

I
say
Why
York
what
wilt
thou
do
Wilt
thou
not
hide
the
trespass
of
thine
own
Have
we
more
sons
or
are
we
like
to
have
Is
not
my
teeming
date
drunk
up
with
time
And
wilt
thou
pluck
my
fair
son
from
mine
age
And
rob
me
of
a
happy
mothers
name
Is
he
not
like
thee
Is
he
not
thine
own
Thou
fond
mad
woman
Wilt
thou
conceal
this
dark
conspiracy
dozen
of
them
here
have
taen
the
sacrament
And
interchangeably
set
down
their
hands
To
kill
the
King
at
Oxford
He
shall
be
none
Well
keep
him
here
Then
what
is
that
to
him
Away
fond
woman
were
he
twenty
times
my
son
I
would
appeach
him
Hadst
thou
groand
for
him
As
I
have
done
thou
wouldst
be
more
pitiful
But
now
I
know
thy
mind
thou
dost
suspect
That
I
have
been
disloyal
to
thy
bed
And
that
he
is
a
bastard
not
thy
son
Sweet
York
sweet
husband
be
not
of
that
mind
He
is
as
like
thee
as
a
man
may
be
Not
like
to
me
or
any
of
my
kin
And
yet
I
love
him
Make
way
unruly
woman
After
Aumerle
Mount
thee
upon
his
horse
Spur
post
and
get
before
him
to
the
King
And
beg
thy
pardon
ere
he
do
accuse
thee
Ill
not
be
long
behind
though
I
be
old
I
doubt
not
but
to
ride
as
fast
as
York
And
never
will
I
rise
up
from
the
ground
Till
Bolingbroke
have
pardond
thee
Away
be
gone
Didst
thou
not
mark
the
King
what
words
he
spake
Have
I
no
friend
will
rid
me
of
this
living
fear
Was
it
not
so
These
were
his
very
words
Have
I
no
friend
quoth
he
He
spake
it
twice
And
urgd
it
twice
together
did
he
not
He
did
And
speaking
it
he
wishtly
lookd
on
me
As
who
should
say
I
would
thou
wert
the
man
That
would
divorce
this
terror
from
my
heart
Meaning
the
King
at
Pomfret
Come
lets
go
I
am
the
Kings
friend
and
will
rid
his
foe
Kind

York
the
latest
news
we

Is
that
the
rebels

Our

Gloucestershire
But
whether
they
be
taen
or
slain

hear
not
Enter
Welcome
my
lord
What
is
the
news
First
to
thy
sacred
state
wish
I
all
happiness
The
next
news
is
I
have
to
London
sent
The
heads
of
Salisbury
Spencer
Blunt
and
Kent
The
manner
of
their
taking
may
appear
At
large
discoursed
in
this
paper
here
We
thank
thee
gentle
Percy
for
thy
pains
And
to
thy
worth
will
add
right
worthy
gains
Enter
My
lord
I
have
from
Oxford
sent
to
London
The
heads
of
Brocas
and
Sir
Bennet
Seely
Two
of
the
dangerous
consorted
traitors
That
sought
at
Oxford
thy
dire
overthrow
Thy
pains
Fitzwater
shall
not
be
forgot
Right
noble
is
thy
merit
well
I
wot
Enter
With
the
The
grand
conspirator
Abbot
of
Westminster
With
clog
of
conscience
and
sour
melancholy
Hath
yielded
up
his
body
to
the
grave
But
here
is
Carlisle
living
to
abide
Thy
kingly
doom
and
sentence
of
his
pride
Carlisle
this
is
your
doom
Choose
out
some
secret
place
some
reverend
room
More
than
thou
hast
and
with
it
joy
thy
life
So
as
thou
livst
in
peace
die
free
from
strife
For
though
mine
enemy
thou
hast
ever
been
High
sparks
of
honour
in
thee
have
I
seen
Enter
with
attendants
hearing
a
coffin
Great
King
within
this
coffin
I
present
Thy
buried
fear
Herein
all
breathless
lies
The
mightiest
of
thy
greatest
enemies
Richard
of
Bordeaux
by
me
hither
brought
Exton
I
thank
thee
not
for
thou
hast
wrought
deed
of
slander
with
thy
fatal
hand
Upon
my
head
and
all
this
famous
land
From
your
own
mouth
my
lord
did
I
this
deed
They
love
not
poison
that
do
poison
need
Nor
do
I
thee
Though
I
did
wish
him
dead
I
hate
the
murderer
love
him
murdered
The
guilt
of
conscience
take
thou
for
thy
labour
But
neither
my
good
word
nor
princely
favour
With
Cain
go
wander
thorough
shades
of
night
And
never
show
thy
head
by
day
nor
light
Lords
I
protest
my
soul
is
full
of
woe
That
blood
should
sprinkle
me
to
make
me
grow
Come
mourn
with
me
for
what
I
do
lament
And
put
on
sullen
black
incontinent
Ill
make
a
voyage
to
the
Holy
Land
To
wash
this
blood
off
from
my
guilty
hand
March
sadly
after
grace
my
mournings
here
In
weeping
after
this
untimely
bier
I
London
street
Enter
solus
Now
is
the
winter
of
our
discontent
Made
glorious
summer
by
this
sun
of
York
And
all
the
clouds
that
lourd
upon
our
house
In
the
deep
bosom
of
the
ocean
buried
Now
are
our
brows
bound
with
victorious
wreaths
Our
bruised
arms
hung
up
for
monuments
Our
stern
alarums
changd
to
merry
meetings
Our
dreadful
marches
to
delightful
measures
Grimvisagd
war
hath
smoothd
his
wrinkled
front
And
now
instead
of
mounting
barbed
steeds
To
fright
the
souls
of
fearful
adversaries
He
capers
nimbly
in
a
ladys
chamber
To
the
lascivious
pleasing
of
a
lute
But
Ithat
am
not
shapd
for
sportive
tricks
Nor
made
to
court
an
amorous
lookingglass
Ithat
am
rudely
stampd
and
want
loves
majesty
To
strut
before
a
wanton
ambling
nymph
Ithat
am
curtaild
of
this
fair
proportion
Cheated
of
feature
by
dissembling
nature
Deformd
unfinishd
sent
before
my
time
Into
this
breathing
world
scarce
half
made
up
And
that
so
lamely
and
unfashionable
That
dogs
bark
at
me
as
I
halt
by
them
Why
I
in
this
weak
piping
time
of
peace
Have
no
delight
to
pass
away
the
time
Unless
to
spy
my
shadow
in
the
sun
And
descant
on
mine
own
deformity
And
therefore
since
I
cannot
prove
a
lover
To
entertain
these
fair
wellspoken
days
I
am
determined
to
prove
a
villain
And
hate
the
idle
pleasures
of
these
days
Plots
have
I
laid
inductions
dangerous
By
drunken
prophecies
libels
and
dreams
To
set
my
brother
Clarence
and
the
King
In
deadly
hate
the
one
against
the
other
And
if
King
Edward
be
as
true
and
just
As
I
am
subtle
false
and
treacherous
This
day
should
Clarence
closely
be
mewd
up
About
a
prophecy
which
says
that
Of
Edwards
heirs
the
murderer
shall
be
Dive
thoughts
down
to
my
soul
Here
Clarence
comes
Enter
guarded
and
Brother
good
day
What
means
this
armed
guard
That
waits
upon
your
Grace
His
Majesty
Tendring
my
persons
safety
hath
appointed
This
conduct
to
convey
me
to
th
Tower
Upon
what
cause
Because
my
name
is
George
Alack
my
lord
that
fault
is
none
of
yours
He
should
for
that
commit
your
godfathers
belike
his
Majesty
hath
some
intent
That
you
should
be
newchristned
in
the
Tower
But
whats
the
matter
Clarence
May
I
know
Yea
Richard
when
I
know
for
I
protest
As
yet
I
do
not
but
as
I
can
learn
He
hearkens
after
prophecies
and
dreams
And
from
the
crossrow
plucks
the
letter
And
says
a
wizard
told
him
that
by
His
issue
disinherited
should
be
And
for
my
name
of
George
begins
with
It
follows
in
his
thought
that
I
am
he
These
as
I
learn
and
such
like
toys
as
these
Hath
movd
his
Highness
to
commit
me
now
Why
this
it
is
when
men
are
ruld
by
women
Tis
not
the
King
that
sends
you
to
the
Tower
My
Lady
Grey
his
wife
Clarence
tis
she
That
tempers
him
to
this
extremity
Was
it
not
she
and
that
good
man
of
worship
Antony
Woodville
her
brother
there
That
made
him
send
Lord
Hastings
to
the
Tower
From
whence
this
present
day
he
is
delivered
We
are
not
safe
Clarence
we
are
not
safe
By
heaven
I
think
there
is
no
man
is
secure
But
the
Queens
kindred
and
nightwalking
heralds
That
trudge
betwixt
the
King
and
Mistress
Shore
Heard
you
not
what
an
humble
suppliant
Lord
Hastings
was
for
her
delivery
Humbly
complaining
to
her
deity
Got
my
Lord
Chamberlain
his
liberty
Ill
tell
you
whatI
think
it
is
our
way
If
we
will
keep
in
favour
with
the
King
To
be
her
men
and
wear
her
livery
The
jealous
oerworn
widow
and
herself
Since
that
our
brother
dubbd
them
gentlewomen
Are
mighty
gossips
in
our
monarchy
I
beseech
your
Graces
both
to
pardon
me
His
Majesty
hath
straitly
given
in
charge
That
no
man
shall
have
private
conference
Of
what
degree
soever
with
your
brother
Even
so
ant
please
your
worship
Brakenbury
You
may
partake
of
any
thing
we
say
We
speak
no
treason
man
we
say
the
King
Is
wise
and
virtuous
and
his
noble
queen
Well
struck
in
years
fair
and
not
jealous
We
say
that
Shores
wife
hath
a
pretty
foot
cherry
lip
a
bonny
eye
a
passing
pleasing
tongue
And
that
the
Queens
kindred
are
made
gentlefolks
How
say
you
sir
Can
you
deny
all
this
With
this
my
lord
myself
have
naught
to
do
Naught
to
do
with
Mistress
Shore
I
tell
thee
fellow
He
that
doth
naught
with
her
excepting
one
Were
best
to
do
it
secretly
alone
What
one
my
lord
Her
husband
knave
Wouldst
thou
betray
me
I
do
beseech
your
Grace
to
pardon
me
and
withal
Forbear
your
conference
with
the
noble
Duke
We
know
thy
charge
Brakenbury
and
will
obey
We
are
the
Queens
abjects
and
must
obey
Brother
farewell
I
will
unto
the
King
And
whatsoeer
you
will
employ
me
in
Were
it
to
call
King
Edwards
widow
sister
I
will
perform
it
to
enfranchise
you
Meantime
this
deep
disgrace
in
brotherhood
Touches
me
deeper
than
you
can
imagine
I
know
it
pleaseth
neither
of
us
well
Well
your
imprisonment
shall
not
be
long
I
will
deliver
or
else
lie
for
you
Meantime
have
patience
I
must
perforce
Farewell
Go
tread
the
path
that
thou
shalt
neer
return
Simple
plain
Clarence
I
do
love
thee
so
That
I
will
shortly
send
thy
soul
to
heaven
If
heaven
will
take
the
present
at
our
hands
But
who
comes
here
The
newdelivered
Hastings
Enter
Good
time
of
day
unto
my
gracious
lord
As
much
unto
my
good
Lord
Chamberlain
Well
are
you
welcome
to
the
open
air
How
hath
your
lordship
brookd
imprisonment
With
patience
noble
lord
as
prisoners
must
But
I
shall
live
my
lord
to
give
them
thanks
That
were
the
cause
of
my
imprisonment
No
doubt
no
doubt
and
so
shall
Clarence
too
For
they
that
were
your
enemies
are
his
And
have
prevaild
as
much
on
him
as
you
More
pity
that
the
eagles
should
be
mewd
Whiles
kites
and
buzzards
prey
at
liberty
What
news
abroad
No
news
so
bad
abroad
as
this
at
home
The
King
is
sickly
weak
and
melancholy
And
his
physicians
fear
him
mightily
Now
by
Saint
John
that
news
is
bad
indeed
he
hath
kept
an
evil
diet
long
And
overmuch
consumd
his
royal
person
Tis
very
grievous
to
be
thought
upon
Where
is
he
In
his
bed
He
is
Go
you
before
and
I
will
follow
you
He
cannot
live
I
hope
and
must
not
die
Till
George
be
packd
with
posthorse
up
to
heaven
Ill
in
to
urge
his
hatred
more
to
Clarence
With
lies
well
steeld
with
weighty
arguments
And
if
I
fail
not
in
my
deep
intent
Clarence
hath
not
another
day
to
live
Which
done
God
take
King
Edward
to
his
mercy
And
leave
the
world
for
me
to
bustle
in
For
then
Ill
marry
Warwicks
youngest
daughter
What
though
I
killd
her
husband
and
her
father
The
readiest
way
to
make
the
wench
amends
Is
to
become
her
husband
and
her
father
The
which
will
Inot
all
so
much
for
love
As
for
another
secret
close
intent
By
marrying
her
which
I
must
reach
unto
But
yet
I
run
before
my
horse
to
market
Clarence
still
breathes
Edward
still
lives
and
reigns
When
they
are
gone
then
must
I
count
my
gains
Have
patience
madam
theres
no
doubt
his
Majesty
Will
soon
recover
his
accustomd
health
In
that
you
brook
it
ill
it
makes
him
worse
Therefore
for
Gods
sake
entertain
good
comfort
And
cheer
his
Grace
with
quick
and
merry
eyes
If
he
were
dead
what
would
betide
on
me
No
other
harm
but
loss
of
such
a
lord
The
loss
of
such
a
lord
includes
all
harms
The
heavens
have
blessd
you
with
a
goodly
son
To
be
your
comforter
when
he
is
gone
Ah
he
is
young
and
his
minority
Is
put
unto
the
trust
of
Richard
Gloucester
man
that
loves
not
me
nor
none
of
you
Is
it
concluded
he
shall
be
Protector
It
is
determind
not
concluded
yet
But
so
it
must
be
if
the
King
miscarry
Enter
and
Here
come
the
Lords
of
Buckingham
and
Derby
Good
time
of
day
unto
your
royal
Grace
God
make
your
Majesty
joyful
as
you
have
been
The
Countess
Richmond
good
my
Lord
of
Derby
To
your
good
prayer
will
scarcely
say
amen
Yet
Derby
notwithstanding
shes
your
wife
And
loves
not
me
be
you
good
lord
assurd
I
hate
not
you
for
her
proud
arrogance
I
do
beseech
you
either
not
believe
The
envious
slanders
of
her
false
accusers
Or
if
she
be
accusd
on
true
report
Bear
with
her
weakness
which
I
think
proceeds
From
wayward
sickness
and
no
grounded
malice
Saw
you
the
King
today
my
Lord
of
Derby
But
now
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
and
I
Are
come
from
visiting
his
Majesty
What
likelihood
of
his
amendment
Lords
Madam
good
hope
his
Grace
speaks
cheerfully
God
grant
him
health
Did
you
confer
with
him
Ay
madam
he
desires
to
make
atonement
Between
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
and
your
brothers
And
between
them
and
my
Lord
Chamberlain
And
sent
to
warn
them
to
his
royal
presence
Would
all
were
well
But
that
will
never
be
I
fear
our
happiness
is
at
the
height
Enter
and
They
do
me
wrong
and
I
will
not
endure
it
Who
is
it
that
complains
unto
the
King
That
I
forsooth
am
stern
and
love
them
not
By
holy
Paul
they
love
his
Grace
but
lightly
That
fill
his
ears
with
such
dissentious
rumours
Because
I
cannot
flatter
and
look
fair
Smile
in
mens
faces
smooth
deceive
and
cog
Duck
with
French
nods
and
apish
courtesy
I
must
be
held
a
rancorous
enemy
Cannot
a
plain
man
live
and
think
no
harm
But
thus
his
simple
truth
must
be
abusd
With
silken
sly
insinuating
Jacks
To
who
in
all
this
presence
speaks
your
Grace
To
thee
that
hast
nor
honesty
nor
grace
When
have
I
injurd
thee
when
done
thee
wrong
Or
thee
or
thee
or
any
of
your
faction
plague
upon
you
all
His
royal
Grace
Whom
God
preserve
better
than
you
would
wish
Cannot
be
quiet
searce
a
breathing
while
But
you
must
trouble
him
with
lewd
complaints
Brother
of
Gloucester
you
mistake
the
matter
The
King
on
his
own
royal
disposition
And
not
provokd
by
any
suitor
else
Aiming
belike
at
your
interior
hatred
That
in
your
outward
action
shows
itself
Against
my
children
brothers
and
myself
Makes
him
to
send
that
he
may
learn
the
ground
I
cannot
tell
the
world
is
grown
so
bad
That
wrens
make
prey
where
eagles
dare
not
perch
Since
every
Jack
became
a
gentleman
Theres
many
a
gentle
person
made
a
Jack
Come
come
we
know
your
meaning
brother
Gloucester
You
envy
my
advancement
and
my
friends
God
grant
we
never
may
have
need
of
you
Meantime
God
grants
that
I
have
need
of
you
Our
brother
is
imprisond
by
your
means
Myself
disgracd
and
the
nobility
Held
in
contempt
while
great
promotions
Are
daily
given
to
ennoble
those
That
scarce
some
two
days
since
were
worth
a
noble
By
Him
that
raisd
me
to
this
careful
height
From
that
contented
hap
which
I
enjoyd
I
never
did
incense
his
Majesty
Against
the
Duke
of
Clarence
but
have
been
An
earnest
advocate
to
plead
for
him
My
lord
you
do
me
shameful
injury
Falsely
to
draw
me
in
these
vile
suspects
You
may
deny
that
you
were
not
the
mean
Of
my
Lord
Hastings
late
imprisonment
She
may
my
lord
for
She
may
Lord
Rivers
Why
who
knows
not
so
She
may
do
more
sir
than
denying
that
She
may
help
you
to
many
fair
preferments
And
then
deny
her
aiding
hand
therein
And
lay
those
honours
on
your
high
desert
What
may
she
not
She
mayay
marry
may

What

What

Marry
with
a
king
bachelor
and
a
handsome
stripling

Iwis
your

worser
match
My
Lord
of
Gloucester
I
have
too
long
borne
Your
blunt
upbraidings
and
your
bitter
scoffs
By
heaven
I
will
acquaint
his
Majesty
Of
those
gross
taunts
that
oft
I
have
endurd
I
had
rather
be
a
country
servantmaid
Than
a
great
queen
with
this
condition
To
be
so
baited
scornd
and
stormed
at
Enter

Small
joy
have
I
in
being
Englands
Queen
And
lessned

that
small
God
I
beseech
Him
Thy

due
to

What
Threat

with
telling
of
the
King
Tell
him
and

Look

I
have
said
I
will
avoucht
in

of

Tis

Out
devil
I
do
remember
them
to

Thou
killdst
my
husband
Henry
in
the
Tower
And
Edward
my
poor
son
at
Tewksbury
Ere
you
were
queen
ay
or
your
husband
King
I
was
a
packhorse
in
his
great
affairs
weederout
of
his
proud
adversaries
liberal
rewarder
of
his
friends
To
royalize
his
blood
I
spent
mine
own
Ay
and
much
better
blood
than
his
or
thine
In
all
which
time
you
and
your
husband
Grey
Were
factious
for
the
house
of
Lancaster
And
Rivers
so
were
you
Was
not
your
husband
In
Margarets
battle
at
Saint
Albans
slain
Let
me
put
in
your
minds
if
you
forget
What
you
have
been
ere
this
and
what
you
are
Withal
what
I
have
been
and
what
I
am
murdrous
villain
and
so
still
thou
art
Poor
Clarence
did
forsake
his
father
Warwick
Ay
and
forswore
himselfwhich
Jesu
pardon
Which
God
revenge
To
fight
on
Edwards
party
for
the
crown
And
for
his
meed
poor
lord
he
is
mewed
up
I
would
to
God
my
heart
were
flint
like
Edwards
Or
Edwards
soft
and
pitiful
like
mine
I
am
too
childishfoolish
for
this
world
Hie
thee
to
hell
for
shame
and
leave
this
world
Thou
cacodemon
there
thy
kingdom
is
My
Lord
of
Gloucester
in
those
busy
days
Which
here
you
urge
to
prove
us
enemies
We
followd
then
our
lord
our
sovereign
king
So
should
we
you
if
you
should
be
our
king
If
I
should
be
I
had
rather
be
a
pedlar
Far
be
it
from
my
heart
the
thought
thereof
As
little
joy
my
lord
as
you
suppose
You
should
enjoy
were
you
this
countrys
king
As
little
joy
you
may
suppose
in
me
That
I
enjoy
being
the
Queen
thereof
As
little
joy
enjoys
the
Queen
thereof
For
I
am
she
and
altogether
joyless
I
can
no
longer
hold
me
patient
Advancing
Hear
me
you
wrangling
pirates
that
fall
out
In
sharing
that
which
you
have
pilld
from
me
Which
of
you
trembles
not
that
looks
on
me
If
not
that
I
am
Queen
you
bow
like
subjects
Yet
that
by
you
deposd
you
quake
like
rebels
Ah
gentle
villain
do
not
turn
away
Foul
wrinkled
witch
what
makst
thou
in
my
sight
But
repetition
of
what
thou
hast
marrd
That
will
I
make
before
I
let
thee
go
Wert
thou
not
banished
on
pain
of
death
I
was
but
I
do
find
more
pain
in
banishment
Than
death
can
yield
me
here
by
my
abode
husband
and
a
son
thou
owst
to
me
And
thou
a
kingdom
all
of
you
allegiance
This
sorrow
that
I
have
by
right
is
yours
And
all
the
pleasures
you
usurp
are
mine
The
curse
my
noble
father
laid
on
thee
When
thou
didst
crown
his
warlike
brows
with
paper
And
with
thy
scorns
drewst
rivers
from
his
eyes
And
then
to
dry
them
gavst
the
Duke
a
clout
Steepd
in
the
faultless
blood
of
pretty
Rutland
His
curses
then
from
bitterness
of
soul
Denouncd
against
thee
are
all
falln
upon
thee
And
God
not
we
hath
plagud
thy
bloody
deed
So
just
is
God
to
right
the
innocent
twas
the
foulest
deed
to
slay
that
babe
And
the
most
merciless
that
eer
was
heard
of
Tyrants
themselves
wept
when
it
was
reported
No
man
but
prophesied
revenge
for
it
Northumberland
then
present
wept
to
see
it
What
were
you
snarling
all
before
I
came
Ready
to
catch
each
other
by
the
throat
And
turn
you
all
your
hatred
now
on
me
Did
Yorks
dread
curse
prevail
so
much
with
heaven
That
Henrys
death
my
lovely
Edwards
death
Their
kingdoms
loss
my
woeful
banishment
Should
all
but
answer
for
that
peevish
brat
Can
curses
pierce
the
clouds
and
enter
heaven
Why
then
give
way
dull
clouds
to
my
quick
curses
Though
not
by
war
by
surfeit
die
your
king
As
ours
by
murder
to
make
him
a
king
Edward
thy
son
that
now
is
Prince
of
Wales
For
Edward
our
son
that
was
Prince
of
Wales
Die
in
his
youth
by
like
untimely
violence
Thyself
a
queen
for
me
that
was
a
queen
Outlive
thy
glory
like
my
wretched
self
Long
mayest
thou
live
to
wail
thy
childrens
death
And
see
another
as
I
see
thee
now
Deckd
in
thy
rights
as
thou
art
stalld
in
mine
Long
die
thy
happy
days
before
thy
death
And
after
many
lengthned
hours
of
grief
Die
neither
mother
wife
nor
Englands
Queen
Rivers
and
Dorset
you
were
standers
by
And
so
wast
thou
Lord
Hastings
when
my
son
Was
stabbd
with
bloody
daggers
God
I
pray
him
That
none
of
you
may
live
his
natural
age
But
by
some
unlookd
accident
cut
off
Have
done
thy
charm
thou
hateful
witherd
hag
And
leave
out
thee
Stay
dog
for
thou
shalt
hear
me
If
heaven
have
any
grievous
plague
in
store
Exceeding
those
that
I
can
wish
upon
thee
let
them
keep
it
till
thy
sins
be
ripe
And
then
hurl
down
their
indignation
On
thee
the
troubler
of
the
poor
worlds
peace
The
worm
of
conscience
still
begnaw
thy
soul
Thy
friends
suspect
for
traitors
while
thou
livst
And
take
deep
traitors
for
thy
dearest
friends
No
sleep
close
up
that
deadly
eye
of
thine
Unless
it
be
while
some
tormenting
dream
Affrights
thee
with
a
hell
of
ugly
devils
Thou
elvishmarkd
abortive
rooting
hog
Thou
that
wast
seald
in
thy
nativity
The
slave
of
nature
and
the
son
of
hell
Thou
slander
of
thy
heavy
mothers
womb
Thou
loathed
issue
of
thy
fathers
loins
Thou
rag
of
honour
thou
detested
Margaret
Richard
Ha
I
call
thee
not
I
cry
thee
mercy
then
for
I
did
think
That
thou
hadst
calld
me
all
these
bitter
names
Why
so
I
did
but
lookd
for
no
reply
let
me
make
the
period
to
my
curse
Tis
done
by
me
and
ends
inMargaret
Thus
have
you
breathd
your
curse
against
yourself
Poor
painted
queen
vain
flourish
of
my
fortune
Why
strewst
thou
sugar
on
that
bottled
spider
Whose
deadly
web
ensnareth
thee
about
Fool
fool
thou
whetst
a
knife
to
kill

The
day
will
come
that
thou
shalt
wish
for
me
To
help
thee
curse
this
poisonous
bunchbackd
toad
Falseboding
woman
end
thy
frantic
curse
Lest
to
thy
harm
thou
move
our
patience
Foul
shame
upon
you
you
have
all
movd
mine
Were
you
well
servd
you
would
be
taught
your
duty
To
serve
me
well
you
all
should
do
me
duty
Teach
me
to
be
your
queen
and
you
my
subjects
serve
me
well
and
teach
yourselves
that
duty
Dispute
not
with
her
she
is
lunatic
Peace
Master
Marquis
you
are
malapert
Your
firenew
stamp
of
honour
is
scarce
current
that
your
young
nobility
could
judge
What
twere
to
lose
it
and
be
miserable
They
that
stand
high
have
many
blasts
to
shake
them
And
if
they
fall
they
dash
themselves
to
pieces
Good
counsel
marry
learn
it
learn
it
Marquis
It
touches
you
my
lord
as
much
as
me
Ay
and
much
more
but
I
was
born
so
high
Our
aery
buildeth
in
the
cedars
top
And
dallies
with
the
wind
and
scorns
the
sun
And
turns
the
sun
to
shadealas
alas
Witness
my
son
now
in
the
shade
of
death
Whose
bright
outshining
beams
thy
cloudy
wrath
Hath
in
eternal
darkness
folded
up
Your
aery
buildeth
in
our
aerys
nest
God
that
seest
it
do
not
suffer
it
As
it
is
won
with
blood
lost
be
it
so
Peace
peace
for
shame
if
not
for
charity
Urge
neither
charity
nor
shame
to
me
Uncharitably
with
me
have
you
dealt
And
shamefully
my
hopes
by
you
are
butcherd
My
charity
is
outrage
life
my
shame
And
in
that
shame
still
live
my
sorrows

Have

done
princely
Buckingham
Ill
kiss
thy
hand
In
sign
of
league
and
amity
with
thee
Now
fair
befall
thee
and
thy
noble
house
Thy
garments
are
not
spotted
with
our
blood
Nor
thou
within
the
compass
of
my
curse
Nor
no
one
here
for
curses
never
pass
The
lips
of
those
that
breathe
them
in
the
air
I
will
not
think
but
they
ascend
the
sky
And
there
awake
Gods
gentlesleeping
peace
Buckingham
take
heed
of
yonder
dog
Look
when
he
fawns
he
bites
and
when
he
bites
His
venom
tooth
will
rankle
to
the
death
Have
not
to
do
with
him
beware
of
him
Sin
death
and
hell
have
set
their
marks
on
him
And
all
their
ministers
attend
on
him
What
doth
she
say
my
Lord
of
Buckingham
Nothing
that
I
respect
my
gracious
lord
What
dost
thou
scorn
me
for
my
gentle
counsel
And
soothe
the
devil
that
I
warn
thee
from
but
remember
this
another
day
When
he
shall
split
thy
very
heart
with
sorrow
And
say
poor
Margaret
was
a
prophetess
Live
each
of
you
the
subjects
to
his
hate
And
he
to
yours
and
all
of
you
to
Gods
My
hair
doth
stand
an
end
to
hear
her
curses
And
so
doth
mine
I
muse
why
shes
at
liberty
I
cannot
blame
her
by
Gods
holy
Mother
She
hath
had
too
much
wrong
and
I
repent
My
part
thereof
that
I
have
done
to
her
I
never
did
her
any
to
my
knowledge
Yet
you
have
all
the
vantage
of
her
wrong
I
was
too
hot
to
do
somebody
good
That
is
too
cold
in
thinking
of
it
now
Marry
as
for
Clarence
he
is
well
repaid
He
is
frankd
up
to
fatting
for
his
pains
God
pardon
them
that
are
the
cause
thereof
virtuous
and
a
Christianlike
conclusion
To
pray
for
them
that
have
done
scathe
to
us
So
do
I
ever
Aside
being
well
advisd
For
had
I
cursd
now
I
had
cursd
myself
Enter
Madam
his
Majesty
doth
can
for
you
And
for
your
Grace
and
you
my
gracious
lords
Catesby
I
come
Lords
will
you
go
with
me
We
wait
upon
your
Grace
I
do
the
wrong
and
first
begin
to
brawl
The
secret
mischiefs
that
I
set
abroach
I
lay
unto
the
grievous
charge
of
others
Clarence
who
I
indeed
have
cast
in
darkness
I
do
beweep
to
many
simple
gulls
Namely
to
Derby
Hastings
Buckingham
And
tell
them
tis
the
Queen
and
her
allies
That
stir
the
King
against
the
Duke
my
brother
Now
they
believe
it
and
withal
whet
me
To
be
revengd
on
Rivers
Dorset
Grey
But
then
I
sigh
and
with
a
piece
of
Scripture
Tell
them
that
God
bids
us
do
good
for
evil
And
thus
I
clothe
my
naked
villainy
With
odd
old
ends
stoln
forth
of
holy
writ
And
seem
a
saint
when
most
I
play
the
devil
Enter
two
But
soft
here
come
my
executioners
How
now
my
hardy
stout
resolved
mates
Are
you
now
going
to
dispatch
this
thing
We
are
my
lord
and
come
to
have
the
warrant
That
we
may
be
admitted
where
he
is
Well
thought
upon
I
have
it
here
about
me
Gives
the
warrant
When
you
have
done
repair
to
Crosby
Place
But
sirs
be
sudden
in
the
execution
Withal
obdurate
do
not
hear
him
plead
For
Clarence
is
wellspoken
and
perhaps
May
move
your
hearts
to
pity
if
you
mark
him
Tut
tut
my
lord
we
will
not
stand
to
prate
Talkers
are
no
good
doers
Be
assurd
We
go
to
use
our
hands
and
not
our
tongues
Your
eyes
drop
millstones
when
fools
eyes
fall
tears
I
like
you
lads
about
your
business
straight
Go
go
dispatch
We
will
my
noble
lord
Good
grandam
tell
us
is
our
father
dead
No
boy
Why
do
you
weep
so
oft
and
beat
your
breast
And
cry
Clarence
my
unhappy
son
Why
do
you
look
on
us
and
shake
your
head
And
call
us
orphans
wretches
castaways
If
that
our
noble
father
were
alive
My
pretty
cousins
you
mistake
me
both
I
do
lament
the
sickness
of
the
King
As
loath
to
lose
him
not
your
fathers
death
It
were
lost
sorrow
to
wail
one
thats
lost
Then
you
conclude
my
grandam
he
is
dead
The
King
mine
uncle
is
to
blame
for
it
God
will
revenge
it
whom
I
will
importune
With
earnest
prayers
all
to
that
effect
And
so
will
I
Peace
children
peace
The
King
doth
love
you
well
Incapable
and
shallow
innocents
You
cannot
guess
who
causd
your
fathers
death
Grandam
we
can
for
my
good
uncle
Gloucester
Told
me
the
King
provokd
to
it
by
the
Queen
Devisd
impeachments
to
imprison
him
And
when
my
uncle
told
me
so
he
wept
And
pitied
me
and
kindly
kissd
my
cheek
Bade
me
rely
on
him
as
on
my
father
And
he
would
love
me
dearly
as
a
child
Ah
that
deceit
should
steal
such
gentle
shape
And
with
a
virtuous
vizor
hide
deep
vice
He
is
my
son
ay
and
therein
my
shame
Yet
from
my
dugs
he
drew
not
this
deceit
Think
you
my
uncle
did
dissemble
grandam
Ay
boy
I
cannot
think
it
Hark
what
noise
is
this
Enter
with
her
hair
about
her
ears
and
after
her
Ah
who
shall
hinder
me
to
wail
and
weep
To
chide
my
fortune
and
torment
myself
Ill
join
with
black
despair
against
my
soul
And
to
myself
become
an
enemy
What
means
this
scene
of
rude
impatience
To
make
an
act
of
tragic
violence
my
lord
thy
son
our
king
is
dead
Why
grow
the
branches
when
the
root
is
gone
Why
wither
not
the
leaves
that
want
their
sap
If
you
will
live
lament
if
die
be
brief
That
our
swiftwinged
souls
may
catch
the
Kings
Or
like
obedient
subjects
follow
him
To
his
new
kingdom
of
neerchanging
night
Ah
so
much
interest
have
I
in
thy
sorrow
As
I
had
title
in
thy
noble
husband
I
have
bewept
a
worthy
husbands
death
And
livd
with
looking
on
his
images
But
now
two
mirrors
of
his
princely
semblance
Are
crackd
in
pieces
by
malignant
death
And
I
for
comfort
have
but
one
false
glass
That
grieves
me
when
I
see
my
shame
in
him
Thou
art
a
widow
yet
thou
art
a
mother
And
hast
the
comfort
of
thy
children
left
But
death
hath
snatchd
my
husband
from
mine
arms
And
pluckd
two
crutches
from
my
feeble
hands
Clarence
and
Edward
what
cause
have
I
Thine
being
but
a
moiety
of
my
moan
To
overgo
thy
woes
and
drown
thy
cries
Ah
aunt
you
wept
not
for
our
fathers
death
How
can
we
aid
you
with
our
kindred
tears
Our
fatherless
distress
was
left
unmoand
Your
widowdolour
likewise
be
unwept
Give
me
no
help
in
lamentation
I
am
not
barren
to
bring
forth
complaints
All
springs
reduce
their
currents
to
mine
eyes
That
I
being
governd
by
the
watery
moon
May
send
forth
plenteous
tears
to
drown
the
world
Ah
for
my
husband
for
my
dear
Lord
Edward
Ah
for
our
father
for
our
dear
Lord
Clarence
Alas
for
both
both
mine
Edward
and
Clarence
What
stay
had
I
but
Edward
and
hes
gone
What
stay
had
we
but
Clarence
and
hes
gone
What
stays
had
I
but
they
and
they
are
gone
Was
never
widow
had
so
dear
a
loss
Were
never
orphans
had
so
dear
a
loss
Was
never
mother
had
so
dear
a
loss
Alas
I
am
the
mother
of
these
griefs
Their
woes
are
parcelld
mine
is
general
She
for
an
Edward
weeps
and
so
do
I
I
for
a
Clarence
weep
so
doth
not
she
These
babes
for
Clarence
weep
and
so
do
I
I
for
an
Edward
weep
so
do
not
they
Alas
you
three
on
me
threefold
distressd
Pour
all
your
tears
I
am
your
sorrows
nurse
And
I
will
pamper
it
with
lamentation
Comfort
dear
mother
God
is
much
displeasd
That
you
take
with
unthankfulness
his
doing
In
common
worldly
things
tis
called
ungrateful
With
dull
unwillingness
to
repay
a
debt
Which
with
a
bounteous
hand
was
kindly
lent
Much
more
to
be
thus
opposite
with
heaven
For
it
requires
the
royal
debt
it
lent
you
Madam
bethink
you
like
a
careful
mother
Of
the
young
prince
your
son
Send
straight
for
him
Let
him
be
crownd
in
him
your
comfort
lives
Drown
desperate
sorrow
in
dead
Edwards
grave
And
plant
your
joys
in
living
Edwards
throne
Enter
and
Sister
have
comfort
All
of
us
have
cause
To
wail
the
dimming
of
our
shining
star
But
none
can
help
our
harms
by
wailing
them
Madam
my
mother
I
do
cry
you
mercy
I
did
not
see
your
Grace
Humbly
on
my
knee
I
crave
your
blessing
God
bless
thee
and
put
meekness
in
thy
breast
Love
charity
obedience
and
true
duty
Amen
Aside
And
make
me
die
a
good
old
man
That
is
the
butt
end
of
a
mothers
blessing
I
marvel
that
her
Grace
did
leave
it
out
You
cloudy
princes
and
heartsorrowing
peers
That
bear
this
heavy
mutual
load
of
moan
Now
cheer
each
other
in
each
others
love
Though
we
have
spent
our
harvest
of
this
king
We
are
to
reap
the
harvest
of
his
son
The
broken
rancour
of
your
highswoln
hearts
But
lately
splinterd
knit
and
joind
together
Must
gently
be
preservd
cherishd
and
kept
Me
seemeth
good
that
with
some
little
train
Forthwith
from
Ludlow
the
young
prince
be
fet
Hither
to
London
to
be
crownd
our
King
Why
with
some
little
train
my
Lord
of
Buckingham
Marry
my
lord
lest
by
a
multitude
The
newheald
wound
of
malice
should
break
out
Which
would
be
so
much
the
more
dangerous
By
how
much
the
estate
is
green
and
yet
ungovernd
Where
every
horse
bears
his
commanding
rein
And
may
direct
his
course
as
please
himself
As
well
the
fear
of
harm
as
harm
apparent
In
my
opinion
ought
to
be
prevented
I
hope
the
King
made
peace
with
all
of
us
And
the
compact
is
firm
and
true
in
me
And
so
in
me
and
so
I
think
in
an
Yet
since
it
is
but
green
it
should
be
put
To
no
apparent
likelihood
of
breach
Which
haply
by
much
company
might
be
urgd
Therefore
I
say
with
noble
Buckingham
That
it
is
meet
so
few
should
fetch
the
Prince
And
so
say
I
Then
be
it
so
and
go
we
to
determine
Who
they
shall
be
that
straight
shall
post
to
Ludlow
Madam
and
you
my
sister
will
you
go
To
give
your
censures
in
this
business
My
lord
whoever
journeys
to
the
Prince
For
God
sake
let
not
us
two
stay
at
home
For
by
the
way
Ill
sort
occasion
As
index
to
the
story
we
late
talkd
of
To
part
the
Queens
proud
kindred
from
the
Prince
My
other
self
my
counsels
consistory
My
oracle
my
prophet
my
dear
cousin
I
as
a
child
will
go
by
thy
direction
Toward
Ludlow
then
for
well
not
stay
behind
Last
night
I
hear
they
lay
at
Stony
Stratford
And
at
Northampton
they
do
rest
tonight
Tomorrow
or
next
day
they
will
be
here
I
long
with
all
my
heart
to
see
the
Prince
I
hope
he
is
much
grown
since
last
I
saw
him
But
I
hear
no
they
say
my
son
of
York
Has
almost
overtaen
him
in
his
growth
Ay
mother
but
I
would
not
have
it
so
Why
my
good
cousin
it
is
good
to
grow
Grandam
one
night
as
we
did
sit
at
supper
My
uncle
Rivers
talkd
how
I
did
grow
More
than
my
brother
Ay
quoth
my
uncle
Gloucester
Small
herbs
have
grace
great
weeds
do
grow
apace
And
since
methinks
I
would
not
grow
so
fast
Because
sweet
flowrs
are
slow
and
weeds
make
haste
Good
faith
good
faith
the
saying
did
not
hold
In
him
that
did
object
the
same
to
thee
He
was
the
wretchedst
thing
when
he
was
young
So
long
agrowing
and
so
leisurely
That
if
his
rule
were
true
he
should
be
gracious
And
so
no
doubt
he
is
my
gracious
madam
I
hope
he
is
but
yet
let
mothers
doubt
Now
by
my
troth
if
I
had
been
remembred
I
could
have
given
my
uncles
Grace
a
flout
To
touch
his
growth
nearer
than
he
touchd
mine
How
my
young
York
I
prithee
let
me
hear
it
Marry
they
say
my
uncle
grew
so
fast
That
he
could
gnaw
a
crust
at
two
hours
old
Twas
full
two
years
ere
I
could
get
a
tooth
Grandam
this
would
have
been
a
biting
jest
I
prithee
pretty
York
who
told
thee
this
Grandam
his
nurse
His
nurse
Why
she
was
dead
ere
thou
wast
born
If
twere
not
she
I
cannot
tell
who
told
me
parlous
boy
Go
to
you
are
too
shrewd
Good
madam
be
not
angry
with
the
child
Pitchers
have
ears
Enter
a
Here
comes
a
messenger
What
news
Such
news
my
lord
as
grieves
me
to
report
How
doth
the
Prince
Well
madam
and
in
health
What
is
thy
news
Lord
Rivers
and
Lord
Grey
Are
sent
to
Pomfret
and
with
them
Sir
Thomas
Vaughan
prisoners
Who
hath
committed
them
The
mighty
Dukes
Gloucester
and
Buckingham
For
what
offence
The
sum
of
all
I
can
I
have
disclosd
Why
or
for
what
the
nobles
were
committed
Is
all
unknown
to
me
my
gracious
lord
Ay
me
I
see
the
ruin
of
my
house
The
tiger
now
hath
seizd
the
gentle
hind
Insulting
tyranny
begins
to
jet
Upon
the
innocent
and
aweless
throne
Welcome
destruction
blood
and
massacre
I
see
as
in
a
map
the
end
of
all
Accursed
and
unquiet
wrangling
days
How
many
of
you
have
mine
eyes
beheld
My
husband
lost
his
life
to
get
the
crown
And
often
up
and
down
my
sons
were
tossd
For
me
to
joy
and
weep
their
gain
and
loss
And
being
seated
and
domestic
broils
Clean
overblown
themselves
the
conquerors
Make
war
upon
themselvesbrother
to
brother
Blood
to
blood
self
against
self
preposterous
And
frantic
outrage
end
thy
damned
spleen
Or
let
me
die
to
look
on
death
no
more
Come
come
my
boy
we
will
to
sanctuary
Madam
farewell
Stay
I
will
go
with
you
You
have
no
cause
To
the
My
gracious
lady
go
And
thither
bear
your
treasure
and
your
goods
For
my
part
Ill
resign
unto
your
Grace
The
seal
I
keep
and
so
betide
to
me
As
well
I
tender
you
and
all
of
yours
Go
Ill
conduct
you
to
the
sanctuary
London
street
The
trumpets
sound
Enter
the
and
others
Welcome
sweet
Prince
to
London
to
your
chamber
Welcome
dear
cousin
my
thoughts
sovereign
The
weary
way
hath
made
you
melancholy
No
uncle
but
our
crosses
on
the
way
Have
made
it
tedious
wearisome
and
heavy
I
want
more
uncles
here
to
welcome
me
Sweet
Prince
the
untainted
virtue
of
your
years
Hath
not
yet
divd
into
the
worlds
deceit
Nor
more
can
you
distinguish
of
a
man
Than
of
his
outward
show
which
God
He
knows
Seldom
or
never
jumpeth
with
the
heart
Those
uncles
which
you
want
were
dangerous
Your
Grace
attended
to
their
sugred
words
But
lookd
not
on
the
poison
of
their
hearts
God
keep
you
from
them
and
from
such
false
friends
God
keep
me
from
false
friends
but
they
were
none
My
lord
the
Mayor
of
London
comes
to
greet
you
Enter
the
and
his
train
God
bless
your
Grace
with
health
and
happy
days
I
thank
you
good
my
lord
and
thank
you
all
I
thought
my
mother
and
my
brother
York
Would
long
ere
this
have
met
us
on
the
way
Fie
what
a
slug
is
Hastings
that
he
comes
not
To
tell
us
whether
they
will
come
or
no
Enter
And
in
good
time
here
comes
the
sweating
Lord
Welcome
my
lord
What
will
our
mother
come
On
what
occasion
God
He
knows
not
I
The
Queen
your
mother
and
your
brother
York
Have
taken
sanctuary
The
tender
Prince
Would
fain
have
come
with
me
to
meet
your
Grace
But
by
his
mother
was
perforce
withheld
Fie
what
an
indirect
and
peevish
course
Is
this
of
hers
Lord
Cardinal
will
your
Grace
Persuade
the
Queen
to
send
the
Duke
of
York
Unto
his
princely
brother
presently
If
she
deny
Lord
Hastings
go
with
him
And
from
her
jealous
arms
pluck
him
perforce
My
Lord
of
Buckingham
if
my
weak
oratory
Can
from
his
mother
win
the
Duke
of
York
Anon
expect
him
here
but
if
she
be
obdurate
To
mild
entreaties
God
in
heaven
forbid
We
should
infringe
the
holy
privilege
Of
blessed
sanctuary
Not
for
all
this
land
Would
I
be
guilty
of
so
deep
a
sin
You
are
too
senselessobstinate
my
lord
Too
ceremonious
and
traditional
Weigh
it
but
with
the
grossness
of
this
age
You
break
not
sanctuary
in
seizing
him
The
benefit
thereof
is
always
granted
To
those
whose
dealings
have
deservd
the
place
And
those
who
have
the
wit
to
claim
the
place
This
Prince
hath
neither
claimd
it
nor
deservd
it
And
therefore
in
mine
opinion
cannot
have
it
Then
taking
him
from
thence
that
is
not
there
You
break
no
privilege
nor
charter
there
Oft
have
I
heard
of
sanctuary
men
But
sanctuary
children
never
till
now
My
lord
you
shall
oerrule
my
mind
for
once
Come
on
Lord
Hastings
will
you
go
with
me
I
go
my
lord
Good
lords
make
all
the
speedy
haste
you
may
Say
uncle
Gloucester
if
our
brother
come
Where
shall
we
sojourn
till
our
coronation
Where
it
seems
best
unto
your
royal
self
If
I
may
counsel
you
some
day
or
two
Your
Highness
shall
repose
you
at
the
Tower
Then
where
you
please
and
shall
be
thought
most
fit
For
your
best
health
and
recreation
I
do
not
like
the
Tower
of
any
place
Did
Julius
Caesar
build
that
place
my
lord
He
did
my
gracious
lord
begin
that
place
Which
since
succeeding
ages
have
reedified
Is
it
upon
record
or
else
reported
Successively
from
age
to
age
he
built
it
Upon
record
my
gracious
lord
But
say
my
lord
it
were
not
registred
Methinks
the
truth
should
Eve
from
age
to
age
As
twere
retaild
to
all
posterity
Even
to
the
general
allending
day
Aside
So
wise
so
young
they
say
do
never
live
long
What
say
you
uncle
I
say
without
characters
fame
lives
long
Aside
Thus
like
the
formal
vice
Iniquity
I
moralize
two
meanings
in
one
word
That
Julius
Caesar
was
a
famous
man
With
what
his
valour
did
enrich
his
wit
His
wit
set
down
to
make
his
valour
live
Death
makes
no
conquest
of
this
conqueror
For
now
he
lives
in
fame
though
not
in
life
Ill
tell
you
what
my
cousin
Buckingham
What
my
gracious
lord
An
if
I
live
until
I
be
a
man
Ill
win
our
ancient
right
in
France
again
Or
die
a
soldier
as
I
livd
a
king
Aside
Short
summers
lightly
have
a
forward
spring
Enter
young
and
the
Now
in
good
time
here
comes
the
Duke
of
York
Richard
of
York
how
fares
our
loving
brother
Well
my
dread
lord
so
must
I
can
you
now
Ay
brother
to
our
grief
as
it
is
yours
Too
late
he
died
that
might
have
kept
that
title
Which
by
his
death
hath
lost
much
majesty
How
fares
our
cousin
noble
Lord
of
York
I
thank
you
gentle
uncle
my
lord
You
said
that
idle
weeds
are
fast
in
growth
The
Prince
my
brother
hath
outgrown
me
far
He
hath
my
lord
And
therefore
is
he
idle
my
fair
cousin
I
must
not
say
so
Then
he
is
more
beholding
to
you
than
I
He
may
command
me
as
my
sovereign
But
you
have
power
in
me
as
in
a
kinsman
I
pray
you
uncle
give
me
this
dagger
My
dagger
little
cousin
With
all
my
heart
beggar
brother
Of
my
kind
uncle
that
I
know
will
give
And
being
but
a
toy
which
is
no
grief
to
give
greater
gift
than
that
Ill
give
my
cousin
greater
gift
thats
the
sword
to
it
Ay
gentle
cousin
were
it
light
enough
then
I
see
you
will
part
but
with
light
gifts
In
weightier
things
youll
say
a
beggar
nay
It
is
too
heavy
for
your
Grace
to
wear
I
weigh
it
lightly
were
it
heavier
What
would
you
have
my
weapon
little
Lord
I
would
that
I
might
thank
you
as
you
call
me
How
Little
My
Lord
of
York
will
still
be
cross
in
talk
Uncle
your
Grace
knows
how
to
bear
with
him
You
mean
to
bear
me
not
to
bear
with
me
Uncle
my
brother
mocks
both
you
and
me
Because
that
I
am
little
like
an
ape
He
thinks
that
you
should
bear
me
on
your
shoulders
With
what
a
sharpprovided
wit
he
reasons
To
mitigate
the
scorn
he
gives
his
uncle
He
prettily
and
aptly
taunts
himself
So
cunning
and
so
young
is
wonderful
My
lord
willt
please
you
pass
along
Myself
and
my
good
cousin
Buckingham
Will
to
your
mother
to
entreat
of
her
To
meet
you
at
the
Tower
and
welcome
you
What
will
you
go
unto
the
Tower
my
lord
My
Lord
Protector
needs
will
have
it
so
I
shall
not
sleep
in
quiet
at
the
Tower
Why
what
should
you
fear
Marry
my
uncle
Clarence
angry
ghost
My
grandam
told
me
he
was
murderd
there
I
fear
no
uncles
dead
Nor
none
that
live
I
hope
An
if
they
live
I
hope
I
need
not
fear
But
come
my
lord
and
with
a
heavy
heart
Thinking
on
them
go
I
unto
the
Tower
sennet
Think
you
my
lord
this
little
prating
York
Was
not
incensed
by
his
subtle
mother
To
taunt
and
scorn
you
thus
opprobriously
No
doubt
no
doubt
tis
a
perilous
boy
Bold
quick
ingenious
forward
capable
He
is
all
the
mothers
from
the
top
to
toe
Well
let
them
rest
Come
hither
Catesby
Thou
art
sworn
as
deeply
to
effect
what
we
intend
As
closely
to
conceal
what
we
impart
Thou
knowst
our
reasons
urgd
upon
the
way
What
thinkst
thou
Is
it
not
an
easy
matter
To
make
William
Lord
Hastings
of
our
mind
For
the
instalment
of
this
noble
Duke
In
the
seat
royal
of
this
famous
isle
He
for
his
fathers
sake
so
loves
the
Prince
That
he
will
not
be
won
to
aught
against
him
What
thinkst
thou
then
of
Stanley
Will
not
he
He
will
do
all
in
all
as
Hastings
doth
Well
then
no
more
but
this
go
gentle
Catesby
And
as
it
were
far
off
sound
thou
Lord
Hastings
How
he
doth
stand
affected
to
our
purpose
And
summon
him
tomorrow
to
the
Tower
To
sit
about
the
coronation
If
thou
dost
find
him
tractable
to
us
Encourage
him
and
tell
him
all
our
reasons
If
he
be
leaden
icy
cold
unwilling
Be
thou
so
too
and
so
break
off
the
talk
And
give
us
notice
of
his
inclination
For
we
tomorrow
hold
divided
councils
Wherein
thyself
shalt
highly
be
employd
Commend
me
to
Lord
William
Tell
him
Catesby
His
ancient
knot
of
dangerous
adversaries
Tomorrow
are
let
blood
at
Pomfret
Castle
And
bid
my
lord
for
joy
of
this
good
news
Give
Mistress
Shore
one
gentle
kiss
the
more
Good
Catesby
go
effect
this
business
soundly
My
good
lords
both
with
all
the
heed
I
can
Shall
we
hear
from
you
Catesby
ere
we
sleep
You
shall
my
lord
At
Crosby
House
there
shall
you
find
us
both
Now
my
lord
what
shall
we
do
if
we
perceive
Lord
Hastings
will
not
yield
to
our
complots
Chop
off
his
headsomething
we
will
determine
And
look
when
I
am
King
claim
thou
of
me
The
earldom
of
Hereford
and
all
the
movables
Whereof
the
King
my
brother
was
possessd
Ill
claim
that
promise
at
your
Graces
hand
And
look
to
have
it
yielded
with
all
kindness
Come
let
us
sup
betimes
that
afterwards
We
may
digest
our
complots
in
some
form
and
to
death
Sir
Richard
Ratcliff
let
me
tell
thee
this
Today
shalt
thou
behold
a
subject
die
For
truth
for
duty
and
for
loyalty
God
bless
the
Prince
from
all
the
pack
of
you
knot
you
are
of
damned
bloodsuckers
You
live
that
shall
cry
woe
for
this
hereafter
Dispatch
the
limit
of
your
lives
is
out
Pomfret
Pomfret
thou
bloody
prison
Fatal
and
ominous
to
noble
peers
Within
the
guilty
closure
of
thy
walls
the
Second
here
was
hackd
to
death
And
for
more
slander
to
thy
dismal
seat
We
give
to
thee
our
guiltless
blood
to
drink
Now
Margarets
curse
is
falln
upon
our
heads
When
she
exclaimd
on
Hastings
you
and
I
For
standing
by
when
Richard
stabbd
her
son
Then
cursd
she
Richard
then
cursd
she
Buckingham
Then
cursd
she
Hastings
remember
God
To
hear
her
prayer
for
them
as
now
for
us
And
for
my
sister
and
her
princely
sons
Be
satisfied
dear
God
with
our
true
blood
Which
as
thou
knowst
unjustly
must
be
spilt
Make
haste
the
hour
of
death
is
expiate
Come
Grey
come
Vaughan
let
us
here
embrace
Farewell
until
we
meet
again
in
heaven
Come
cousin
canst
thou
quake
and
change
thy
colour
Murder
thy
breath
in
middle
of
a
word
And
then
again
begin
and
stop
again
As
if
thou
were
distraught
and
mad
with
terror
Tut
I
can
counterfeit
the
deep
tragedian
Speak
and
look
back
and
pry
on
every
side
Tremble
and
start
at
wagging
of
a
straw
Intending
deep
suspicion
Ghastly
looks
Are
at
my
service
like
enforced
smiles
And
both
are
ready
in
their
offices
At
any
time
to
grace
my
stratagems
But
what
is
Catesby
gone
He
is
and
see
he
brings
the
mayor
along
Enter
the
and
Lord
Mayor
Look
to
the
drawbridge
there
Hark
a
drum
Catesby
oerlook
the
walls
Lord
Mayor
the
reason
we
have
sent
Look
back
defend
thee
here
are
enemies
God
and
our
innocence
defend
and
guard
us
Enter
and
with
head
Be
patient
they
are
friendsRatcliff
and
Lovel
Here
is
the
head
of
that
ignoble
traitor
The
dangerous
and
unsuspected
Hastings
So
dear
I
lovd
the
man
that
I
must
weep
I
took
him
for
the
plainest
harmless
creature
That
breathd
upon
the
earth
a
Christian
Made
him
my
book
wherein
my
soul
recorded
The
history
of
all
her
secret
thoughts
So
smooth
he
daubd
his
vice
with
show
of
virtue
That
his
apparent
open
guilt
omitted
I
mean
his
conversation
with
Shores
wife
He
livd
from
all
attainder
of
suspects
Well
well
he
was
the
covertst
sheltred
traitor
That
ever
livd
Would
you
imagine
or
almost
believe
Weret
not
that
by
great
preservation
We
live
to
tell
itthat
the
subtle
traitor
This
day
had
plotted
in
the
councilhouse
To
murder
me
and
my
good
Lord
of
Gloucester
Had
he
done
so
What
think
you
we
are
Turks
or
Infidels
Or
that
we
would
against
the
form
of
law
Proceed
thus
rashly
in
the
villains
death
But
that
the
extreme
peril
of
the
case
The
peace
of
England
and
our
persons
safety
Enforcd
us
to
this
execution
Now
fair
befall
you
He
deservd
his
death
And
your
good
Graces
both
have
well
proceeded
To
warn
false
traitors
from
the
like
attempts
I
never
lookd
for
better
at
his
hands
After
he
once
fell
in
with
Mistress
Shore
Yet
had
we
not
determind
he
should
die
Until
your
lordship
came
to
see
his
end
Which
now
the
loving
haste
of
these
our
friends
Something
against
our
meanings
have
prevented
Because
my
lord
I
would
have
had
you
heard
The
traitor
speak
and
timorously
confess
The
manner
and
the
purpose
of
his
treasons
That
you
might
well
have
signified
the
same
Unto
the
citizens
who
haply
may
Misconster
us
in
him
and
wail
his
death
But
my
good
lord
your
Graces
words
shall
serve
As
well
as
I
had
seen
and
heard
him
speak
And
do
not
doubt
right
noble
Princes
both
But
Ill
acquaint
our
duteous
citizens
With
all
your
just
proceedings
in
this
cause
And
to
that
end
we
wishd
your
lordship
here
avoid
the
the
the
censures
of
the
carping
world
Which
since
you
come
too
late
of
our
intent
Yet
witness
what
you
hear
we
did
intend
And
so
my
good
Lord
Mayor
we
bid
farewell
Go
after
after
cousin
Buckingham
The
Mayor
towards
Guildhall
hies
him
in
an
post
There
at
your
meetst
advantage
of
the
time
Infer
the
bastardy
of
Edwards
children
Tell
them
how
Edward
put
to
death
a
citizen
Only
for
saying
he
would
make
his
son
Heir
to
the
crownmeaning
indeed
his
house
Which
by
the
sign
thereof
was
termed
so
Moreover
urge
his
hateful
luxury
And
bestial
appetite
in
change
of
lust
Which
stretchd
unto
their
servants
daughters
wives
Even
where
his
raging
eye
or
savage
heart
Without
control
lusted
to
make
a
prey
Nay
for
a
need
thus
far
come
near
my
person
Tell
them
when
that
my
mother
went
with
child
Of
that
insatiate
Edward
noble
York
My
princely
father
then
had
wars
in
France
And
by
true
computation
of
the
time
Found
that
the
issue
was
not
his
begot
Which
well
appeared
in
his
lineaments
Being
nothing
like
the
noble
Duke
my
father
Yet
touch
this
sparingly
as
twere
far
off
Because
my
lord
you
know
my
mother
lives
Doubt
not
my
lord
Ill
play
the
orator
As
if
the
golden
fee
for
which
I
plead
Were
for
myself
and
so
my
lord
adieu
If
you
thrive
well
bring
them
to
Baynards
Castle
Where
you
shall
find
me
well
accompanied
With
reverend
fathers
and
well
learned
bishops
I
go
and
towards
three
or
four
oclock
Look
for
the
news
that
the
Guildhall
affords
Go
Lovel
with
all
speed
to
Doctor
Shaw
To
Go
thou
to
Friar
Penker
Bid
them
both
Meet
me
within
this
hour
at
Baynards
Castle
Now
will
I
go
to
take
some
privy
order
To
draw
the
brats
of
Clarence
out
of
sight
And
to
give
order
that
no
manner
person
Have
any
time
recourse
unto
the
Princes
How
now
how
now
What
say
the
citizens
Now
by
the
holy
Mother
of
our
Lord
The
citizens
are
mum
say
not
a
word
Touchd
you
the
bastardy
of
Edwards
children
I
did
with
his
contract
with
Lady
Lucy
And
his
contract
by
deputy
in
France
Th
insatiate
greediness
of
his
desire
And
his
enforcement
of
the
city
wives
His
tyranny
for
trifles
his
own
bastardy
As
being
got
your
father
then
in
France
And
his
resemblance
being
not
like
the
Duke
Withal
I
did
infer
your
lineaments
Being
the
right
idea
of
your
father
Both
in
your
form
and
nobleness
of
mind
Laid
open
all
your
victories
in
Scotland
Your
discipline
in
war
wisdom
in
peace
Your
bounty
virtue
fair
humility
Indeed
left
nothing
fitting
for
your
purpose
Untouchd
or
slightly
handled
in
discourse
And
when
mine
oratory
drew
toward
end
I
bid
them
that
did
love
their
countrys
good
Cry
God
save
Richard
Englands
royal
King
And
did
they
so
No
so
God
help
me
they
spake
not
a
word
But
like
dumb
statues
or
breathing
stones
Stard
each
on
other
and
lookd
deadly
pale
Which
when
I
saw
I
reprehended
them
And
askd
the
Mayor
what
meant
this
wilfull
silence
His
answer
was
the
people
were
not
used
To
be
spoke
to
but
by
the
Recorder
Then
he
was
urgd
to
tell
my
tale
again
Thus
saith
the
Duke
thus
hath
the
Duke
inferrd
But
nothing
spoke
in
warrant
from
himself
When
he
had
done
some
followers
of
mine
own
At
lower
end
of
the
hall
hurld
up
their
caps
And
some
ten
voices
cried
God
save
King
Richard
And
thus
I
took
the
vantage
of
those
few
Thanks
gentle
citizens
and
friends
quoth
I
This
general
applause
and
cheerful
shout
Argues
your
wisdoms
and
your
love
to
Richard
And
even
here
brake
off
and
came
away
What
tongueless
blocks
were
they
Would
they
not
speak
Will
not
the
Mayor
then
and
his
brethren
come
The
Mayor
is
here
at
hand
Intend
some
fear
Be
not
you
spoke
with
but
by
mighty
suit
And
look
you
get
a
prayerbook
in
your
hand
And
stand
between
two
churchmen
good
my
lord
For
on
that
ground
Ill
make
a
holy
descant
And
be
not
easily
won
to
our
requests
Play
the
maids
part
still
answer
nay
and
take
it
I
go
and
if
you
plead
as
well
for
them
As
I
can
say
nay
to
thee
for
myself
No
doubt
we
bring
it
to
a
happy
issue
Go
go
up
to
the
leads
the
Lord
Mayor
knocks
Enter
the
and
citizens
Welcome
my
lord
I
dance
attendance
here
I
think
the
Duke
will
not
be
spoke
withal
Enter
Now
Catesby
what
says
your
lord
to
my
request
He
doth
entreat
your
Grace
my
noble
lord
To
visit
him
tomorrow
or
next
day
He
is
within
with
two
right
reverend
fathers
Divinely
bent
to
meditation
And
in
no
worldly
suits
would
he
be
movd
To
draw
him
from
his
holy
exercise
Return
good
Catesby
to
the
gracious
Duke
Tell
him
myself
the
Mayor
and
Aldermen
In
deep
designs
in
matter
of
great
moment
No
less
importing
than
our
general
good
Are
come
to
have
some
conference
with
his
Grace
Ill
signify
so
much
unto
him
straight
Ah
ha
my
lord
this
prince
is
not
an
Edward
He
is
not
lolling
on
a
lewd
lovebed
But
on
his
knees
at
meditation
Not
dallying
with
a
brace
of
courtezans
But
meditating
with
two
deep
divines
Not
sleeping
to
engross
his
idle
body
But
praying
to
enrich
his
watchful
soul
Happy
were
England
would
this
virtuous
prince
Take
on
his
Grace
the
sovereignty
thereof
But
sure
I
fear
we
shall
not
win
him
to
it
Marry
God
defend
his
Grace
should
say
us
nay
I
fear
he
will
Here
Catesby
comes
again
Reenter
Now
Catesby
what
says
his
Grace
My
lord
He
wonders
to
what
end
you
have
assembled
Such
troops
of
citizens
to
come
to
him
His
Grace
not
being
warnd
thereof
before
He
fears
my
lord
you
mean
no
good
to
him
Sorry
I
am
my
noble
cousin
should
Suspect
me
that
I
mean
no
good
to
him
By
heaven
we
come
to
him
in
perfect
love
And
so
once
more
return
and
tell
his
Grace
When
holy
and
devout
religious
men
Are
at
their
beads
tis
much
to
draw
them
thence
So
sweet
is
zealous
contemplation
Enter
aloft
between
two
returns
See
where
his
Grace
stands
tween
two
clergymen
Two
props
of
virtue
for
a
Christian
prince
To
stay
him
from
the
fall
of
vanity
And
see
a
book
of
prayer
in
his
hand
True
ornaments
to
know
a
holy
man
Famous
Plantagenet
most
gracious
Prince
Lend
favourable
ear
to
our
requests
And
pardon
us
the
interruption
Of
thy
devotion
and
right
Christian
zeal
My
lord
there
needs
no
such
apology
I
do
beseech
your
Grace
to
pardon
me
Who
earnest
in
the
service
of
my
God
Deferrd
the
visitation
of
my
friends
But
leaving
this
what
is
your
Graces
pleasure
Even
that
I
hope
which
pleaseth
God
above
And
all
good
men
of
this
ungovernd
isle
I
do
suspect
I
have
done
some
offence
That
seems
disgracious
in
the
citys
eye
And
that
you
come
to
reprehend
my
ignorance
You
have
my
lord
Would
it
might
please
your
Grace
On
our
entreaties
to
amend
your
fault
Else
wherefore
breathe
I
in
a
Christian
land
Know
then
it
is
your
fault
that
you
resign
The
supreme
seat
the
throne
majestical
The
sceptred
office
of
your
ancestors
Your
state
of
fortune
and
your
due
of
birth
The
lineal
glory
of
your
royal
house
To
the
corruption
of
a
blemishd
stock
Whiles
in
the
mildness
of
your
sleepy
thoughts
Which
here
we
waken
to
our
countrys
good
The
noble
isle
doth
want
her
proper
limbs
Her
face
defacd
with
scars
of
infamy
Her
royal
stock
graft
with
ignoble
plants
And
almost
shouldred
in
the
swallowing
gulf
Of
dark
forgetfulness
and
deep
oblivion
Which
to
recure
we
heartily
solicit
Your
gracious
self
to
take
on
you
the
charge
And
kingly
government
of
this
your
land
Not
as
protector
steward
substitute
Or
lowly
factor
for
anothers
gain
But
as
successively
from
blood
to
blood
Your
right
of
birth
your
empery
your
own
For
this
consorted
with
the
citizens
Your
very
worshipful
and
loving
friends
And
by
their
vehement
instigation
In
this
just
cause
come
I
to
move
your
Grace
I
cannot
tell
if
to
depart
in
silence
Or
bitterly
to
speak
in
your
reproof
Best
fitteth
my
degree
or
your
condition
If
not
to
answer
you
might
haply
think
Tonguetied
ambition
not
replying
yielded
To
bear
the
golden
yoke
of
sovereignty
Which
fondly
you
would
here
impose
on
me
If
to
reprove
you
for
this
suit
of
yours
So
seasond
with
your
faithful
love
to
me
Then
on
the
other
side
I
checkd
my
friends
Thereforeto
speak
and
to
avoid
the
first
And
then
in
speaking
not
to
incur
the
last
Definitively
thus
I
answer
you
Your
love
deserves
my
thanks
but
my
desert
Unmeritable
shuns
your
high
request
First
if
all
obstacles
were
cut
away
And
that
my
path
were
even
to
the
crown
As
the
ripe
revenue
and
due
of
birth
Yet
so
much
is
my
poverty
of
spirit
So
mighty
and
so
many
my
defects
That
I
would
rather
hide
me
from
my
greatness
Being
a
bark
to
brook
no
mighty
sea
Than
in
my
greatness
covet
to
be
hid
And
in
the
vapour
of
my
glory
smotherd
But
God
be
thankd
there
is
no
need
of
me
And
much
I
need
to
help
you
were
there
need
The
royal
tree
hath
left
us
royal
fruit
Which
mellowd
by
the
stealing
hours
of
time
Will
well
become
the
seat
of
majesty
And
make
no
doubt
us
happy
by
his
reign
On
him
I
lay
that
you
would
lay
on
me
The
right
and
fortune
of
his
happy
stars
Which
God
defend
that
I
should
wring
from
him
My
lord
this
argues
conscience
in
your
Grace
But
the
respects
thereof
are
nice
and
trivial
All
circumstances
well
considered
You
say
that
Edward
is
your
brothers
son
So
say
we
too
but
not
by
Edwards
wife
For
first
was
he
contract
to
Lady
Lucy
Your
mother
lives
a
witness
to
his
vow
And
afterward
by
substitute
betrothd
To
Bona
sister
to
the
King
of
France
These
both
put
off
a
poor
petitioner
carecrazd
mother
to
a
many
sons
beautywaning
and
distressed
widow
Even
in
the
afternoon
of
her
best
days
Made
prize
and
purchase
of
his
wanton
eye
Seducd
the
pitch
and
height
of
his
degree
To
base
declension
and
loathd
bigamy
By
her
in
his
unlawful
bed
he
got
This
Edward
whom
our
manners
call
the
Prince
More
bitterly
could
I
expostulate
Save
that
for
reverence
to
some
alive
I
give
a
sparing
limit
to
my
tongue
Then
good
my
lord
take
to
your
royal
self
This
profferd
benefit
of
dignity
If
not
to
bless
us
and
the
land
withal
Yet
to
draw
forth
your
noble
ancestry
From
the
corruption
of
abusing
times
Unto
a
lineal
truederived
course
Do
good
my
lord
your
citizens
entreat
you
Refuse
not
mighty
lord
this
profferd
love
make
them
joyful
grant
their
lawful
suit
Alas
why
would
you
heap
this
care
on
me
I
am
unfit
for
state
and
majesty
I
do
beseech
you
take
it
not
amiss
I
cannot
nor
I
will
not
yield
to
you
If
you
refuse
itas
in
love
and
zeal
Loath
to
depose
the
child
your
brothers
son
As
well
we
know
your
tenderness
of
heart
And
gentle
kind
effeminate
remorse
Which
we
have
noted
in
you
to
your
kindred
And
egally
indeed
to
all
estates
Yet
know
wheer
you
accept
our
suit
or
no
Your
brothers
son
shall
never
reign
our
king
But
we
will
plant
some
other
in
the
throne
To
the
disgrace
and
downfall
of
your
house
And
in
this
resolution
here
we
leave
you
Come
citizens
Zounds
Ill
entreat
no
more
do
not
swear
my
lord
of
Buckingham
Call
him
again
sweet
Prince
accept
their
suit
If
you
deny
them
all
the
land
will
rue
it
Will
you
enforce
me
to
a
world
of
cares
Call
them
again
I
am
not
made
of
stones
But
penetrable
to
your
kind
entreaties
Albeit
against
my
conscience
and
my
soul
Reenter
and
the
rest
Cousin
of
Buckingham
and
sage
grave
men
Since
you
will
buckle
fortune
on
my
back
To
bear
her
burden
wheer
I
will
or
no
I
must
have
patience
to
endure
the
load
But
if
black
scandal
or
foulfacd
reproach
Attend
the
sequel
of
your
imposition
Your
mere
enforcement
shall
acquittance
me
From
all
the
impure
blots
and
stains
thereof
For
God
doth
know
and
you
may
partly
see
How
far
I
am
from
the
desire
of
this
God
bless
your
Grace
We
see
it
and
will
say
it
In
saying
so
you
shall
but
say
the
truth
Then
I
salute
you
with
this
royal
title
Long
live
King
Richard
Englands
worthy
King
Amen
Tomorrow
may
it
please
you
to
be
crownd
Even
when
you
please
for
you
will
have
it
so
Tomorrow
then
we
will
attend
your
Grace
And
so
most
joyfully
we
take
our
leave
To
the
Come
let
us
to
our
holy
work
again
Farewell
my
cousin

As

Upon

To

Kind

Enter
And

How

Prince
and
my
young
son
of
York
Right
well
dear
madam
By
your
patience
I
may
not
suffer
you
to
visit
them
The
King
hath
strictly
chargd
the
contrary
The
King
Whos
that
I
mean
the
Lord
Protector
The
Lord
protect
him
from
that
kingly
title
Hath
he
set
bounds
between
their
love
and
me
I
am
their
mother
who
shall
bar
me
from
them
I
am
their
fathers
mother
I
will
see
them
Their
aunt
I
am
in
law
in
love
their
mother
Then
bring
me
to
their

Ill
bear
thy
blame
And
take
thy
office
from

on
my
peril
No

not
leave

so
I
am
bound
by
oath
and
therefore
pardon
me
Enter
Let

but
meet
you
ladies
one
hour
hence
And
Ill
salute
your
Grace
of
York
as
mother
And
reverend
lookeron
of
two
fair
queens
To
Come
madam
you
must
straight
to
Westminster
There
to
be
crowned
Richards
royal
queen
Ah
cut
my
lace
asunder
That
my
pent
heart
may
have
some
scope
to
beat
Or
else
I
swoon
with
this
deadkilling
news
Despiteful
tidings
unpleasing
news
Be
of
good
cheer
mother
how
fares
your
Grace
Dorset
speak
not
to
me
get
thee
gone
Death
and
destruction
dogs
thee
at
thy
heels
Thy
mothers
name
is
ominous
to
children
If
thou
wilt
outstrip
death
go
cross
the
seas
And
live
with
Richmond
from
the
reach
of
hell
Go
hie
thee
hie
thee
from
this
slaughterhouse
Lest
thou
increase
the
number
of
the
dead
And
make
me
die
the
thrall
of
Margarets
curse
Nor
mother
wife
nor
Englands
counted
queen
Full
of
wise
care
is
this
your
counsel
madam
Take
all
the
swift
advantage
of
the
hours
You
shall
have
letters
from
me
to
my
son
In
your
behalf
to
meet
you
on
the
way
Be
not
taen
tardy
by
unwise
delay
illdispersing
wind
of
misery
my
accursed
womb
the
bed
of
death
cockatrice
hast
thou
hatchd
to
the
world
Whose
unavoided
eye
is
murderous
Come
madam
come
I
in
all
haste
was
sent
And
I
with
all
unwillingness
will
go
would
to
God
that
the
inclusive
verge
Of
golden
metal
that
must
round
my
brow
Were
redhot
steel
to
sear
me
to
the
brains
Anointed
let
me
be
with
deadly
venom
And
die
ere
men
can
say
God
save
the
Queen
Go
go
poor
soul
I
envy
not
thy
glory
To
feed
my
humour
wish
thyself
no
harm
No
why
When
he
that
is
my
husband
now
Came
to
me
as
I
followd
Henrys
corse
When
scarce
the
blood
was
well
washd
from
his
hands
Which
issued
from
my
other
angel
husband
And
that
dear
saint
which
then
I
weeping
followd
when
I
say
I
lookd
on
Richards
face
This
was
my
wish
Be
thou
quoth
I
accursd
For
making
me
so
young
so
old
a
widow
And
when
thou
wedst
let
sorrow
haunt
thy
bed
And
be
thy
wife
if
any
be
so
mad
More
miserable
by
the
life
of
thee
Than
thou
hast
made
me
by
my
dear
lords
death
Lo
ere
I
can
repeat
this
curse
again
Within
so
small
a
time
my
womans
heart
Grossly
grew
captive
to
his
honey
words
And
provd
the
subject
of
mine
own
souls
curse
Which
hitherto
hath
held
my
eyes
from
rest
For
never
yet
one
hour
in
his
bed
Did
I
enjoy
the
golden
dew
of
sleep
But
with
his
timorous
dreams
was
still
awakd
Besides
he
hates
me
for
my
father
Warwick
And
will
no
doubt
shortly
be
rid
of
me
Poor
heart
adieu
I
pity
thy
complaining
No
more
than
with
my
soul
I
mourn
for
yours
Farewell
thou
woeful
welcomer
of
glory
Adieu
poor
soul
that
takst
thy
leave
of
it
To
Go
thou
to
Richmond
and
good
fortune
guide
thee
To
Go
thou
to
Richard
and
good
angels
tend
thee
To
Go
thou
to
sanctuary
and
good
thoughts
possess
thee
I
to
my
grave
where
peace
and
rest
lie
with
me
Eighty
odd
years
of
sorrow
have
I
seen
And
each
hours
joy
wreckd
with
a
week
of
teen
Stay
yet
look
back
with
me
unto
the
Tower
Pity
you
ancient
stones
those
tender
babes
Whom
envy
hath
immurd
within
your
walls
Rough
cradle
for
such
little
pretty
ones
Rude
ragged
nurse
old
sullen
playfellow
For
tender
princes
use
my
babies
well
So
foolish
sorrows
bids
your
stones
farewell
The
tyrannous
and
bloody
act
is
done
The
most
arch
deed
of
piteous
massacre
That
ever
yet
this
land
was
guilty
of
Dighton
and
Forrest
who
I
did
suborn
To
do
this
piece
of
ruthless
butchery
Albeit
they
were
fleshd
villains
bloody
dogs
Melted
with
tenderness
and
mild
compassion
Wept
like
two
children
in
their
deaths
sad
story
thus
quoth
Dighton
lay
the
gentle
babes
Thus
thus
quoth
Forrest
girdling
one
another
Within
their
alabaster
innocent
arms
Their
lips
were
four
red
roses
on
a
stalk
And
in
their
summer
beauty
kissd
each
other
book
of
prayers
on
their
pillow
lay
Which
once
quoth
Forrest
almost
changd
my
mind
But
the
devilthere
the
villain
stoppd
When
Dighton
thus
told
on
We
smothered
The
most
replenished
sweet
work
of
nature
That
from
the
prime
creation
eer
she
framed
Hence
both
are
gone
with
conscience
and
remorse
They
could
not
speak
and
so
I
left
them
both
To
bear
this
tidings
to
the
bloody
King
Enter
And
here
he
comes
All
health
my
sovereign
lord
Kind
Tyrrel
am
I
happy
in
thy
news
If
to
have
done
the
thing
you
gave
in
charge
Beget
your
happiness
be
happy
then
For
it
is
done
But
didst
thou
see
them
dead
I
did
my
lord
And
buried
gentle
Tyrrel
The
chaplain
of
the
Tower
hath
buried
them
But
where
to
say
the
truth
I
do
not
know
Come
to
me
Tyrrel
soon
at
after
supper
When
thou
shalt
tell
the
process
of
their
death
Meantime
but
think
how
I
may
do
thee
good
And
be
inheritor
of
thy
desire
Farewell
till
then
I
humbly
take
my
leave
The
son
of
Clarence
have
I
pent
up
close
His
daughter
meanly
have
I
matchd
in
marriage
The
sons
of
Edward
sleep
in
Abrahams
bosom
And
Anne
my
wife
hath
bid
this
world
good
night
Now
for
I
know
the
Britaine
Richmond
aims
At
young
Elizabeth
my
brothers
daughter
And
by
that
knot
looks
proudly
on
the
crown
To
her
go
I
a
jolly
thriving
wooer
Enter
My
lord
Good
or
bad
news
that
thou
comst
in
so
bluntly
Bad
news
my
lord
Morton
is
fled
to
Richmond
And
Buckingham
backd
with
the
hardy
Welshmen
Is
in
the
field
and
still
his
power
increaseth
Ely
with
Richmond
troubles
me
more
near
Than
Buckingham
and
his
rashlevied
strength
Come
I
have
learnd
that
fearful
commenting
Is
leaden
servitor
to
dull
delay
Delay
leads
impotent
and
snailpacd
beggary
Then
fiery
expedition
be
my
wing
Joves
Mercury
and
herald
for
a
king
Go
muster
men
My
counsel
is
my
shield
We
must
be
brief
when
traitors
brave
the
field
house
Enter
and
Sir
Christopher
tell
Richmond
this
from
me
That
in
the
sty
of
the
most
deadly
boar
My
son
George
Stanley
is
frankd
up
in
hold
If
I
revolt
off
goes
young
Georges
head
The
fear
of
that
holds
off
my
present
aid
So
get
thee
gone
commend
me
to
thy
lord
Withal
say
that
the
Queen
hath
heartily
consented
He
should
espouse
Elizabeth
her
daughter
But
tell
me
where
is
princely
Richmond
now
At
Pembroke
or
at
Harford
west
in
Wales
What
men
of
name
resort
to
him
Sir
Walter
Herbert
a
renowned
soldier
Gilbert
Talbot
Sir
William
Stanley
redoubted
Pembroke
Sir
James
Blunt
And
Rice
ap
Thomas
with
a
valiant
crew
And
many
other
of
great
name
and
worth
And
towards
London
do
they
bend
their
power
If
by
the
way
they
be
not
fought
withal
Well
hie
thee
to
thy
lord
I
kiss
his
hand
My
letter
will
resolve
him
of
my
mind
Farewell
Salisbury
An
open
place
Enter
the
and
guard
with
led
to
execution
Will
not
King
Richard
let
me
speak
with
him
No
my
good
lord
therefore
be
patient
Hastings
and
Edwards
children
Grey
and
Rivers
Holy
King
Henry
and
thy
fair
son
Edward
Vaughan
and
all
that
have
miscarried
By
underhand
corrupted
foul
injustice
If
that
your
moody
discontented
souls
Do
through
the
clouds
behold
this
present
hour
Even
for
revenge
mock
my
destruction
This
is
AllSouls
day
fellow
is
it
not
It
is
my
lord
Why
then
AllSouls
day
is
my
bodys
doomsday
This
is
the
day
which
in
King
Edwards
time
I
wishd
might
fall
on
me
when
I
was
found
False
to
his
children
and
his
wifes
allies
This
is
the
day
wherein
I
wishd
to
fall
By
the
false
faith
of
him
whom
most
I
trusted
This
this
AllSouls
day
to
my
fearful
soul
Is
the
determind
respite
of
my
wrongs
That
high
AllSeer
which
I
dallied
with
Hath
turnd
my
feigned
prayer
on
my
head
And
given
in
earnest
what
I
beggd
in
jest
Thus
doth
He
force
the
swords
of
wicked
men
To
turn
their
own
points
in
their
masters
bosoms
Thus
Margarets
curse
falls
heavy
on
my
neck
When
he
quoth
she
shall
split
thy
heart
with
sorrow
Remember
Margaret
was
a
prophetess
Come
lead
me
officers
to
the
block
of
shame
Wrong
hath
but
wrong
and
blame
the
due
of
blame
Here
pitch
our
tent
even
here
in
Bosworth
field
My
Lord
of
Surrey
why
look
you
so
sad
My
heart
is
ten
times
lighter
than

But

Well

Who
hath
descried
the
number
of
the
traitors
Six
or
seven
thousand

their
utmost
power
Why
our
battalia
trebles
that
account
Besides
the
Kings
name
is
a
tower
of
strength
Which
they
upon
the
adverse
faction
want
Up

the
tent
Come
noble
gentlemen

For

a
busy
day
Enter
on
the
other
side
of
the
field
and
others
Some
pitch
tent
The
weary
sun
hath
made
a
golden
set
And
by
the
bright
tract
of
his
fiery
car
Gives
token
of
a
goodly
day
tomorrow

His

Ratcliff
My
lord
Sawst

the
melancholy
Lord
Northumberland
Thomas
the
Earl
of
Surrey
and
himself
Much
about
cockshut
time
from
troop
to
troop
Went
through
the
army
cheering
up
the
soldiers
So
I
am
satisfied
Give
me
a
bowl
of
wine
I
have
not
that
alacrity
of
spirit
Nor
cheer
of
mind
that
I
was
wont
to
have
Set
it
down
Is
ink
and
paper
ready
It
is
my
lord
Bid
my
guard
watch
leave
me
about
the
mid
of
night

And
help
to
arm
me
Leave

Enter

All

can
afford
Be

Tell

how
fares
our
loving
mother
I
by
attorney
bless
thee
from
thy
mother
Who
prays
continually
for
Richmonds
good
So
much
for
that
The
silent
hours
steal
on
And
flaky
darkness
breaks
within
the
east
In
brief
for
so
the
season
bids
us
be
Prepare
thy
battle
early
in
the
morning
And
put
thy
fortune
to
the
arbitrement
Of
bloody
strokes
and
mortalstaring
war
I
as
I
maythat
which
I
would
I
cannot
With
best
advantage
will
deceive
the
time
And
aid
thee
in
this
doubtful
shock
of
arms
But
on
thy
side
I
may
not
be
too
forward
Lest
being
seen
thy
brother
tender
George
Be
executed
in
his
fathers
sight
Farewell
the
leisure
and
the
fearful
time
Cuts
off
the
ceremonious
vows
of
love
And
ample
interchange
of
sweet
discourse
Which
solongsundred
friends
should
dwell
upon
God
give
us
leisure
for
these
rites
of
love
Once
more
adieu

valiant
and

Good

to
his
regiment
Ill
strive
with
troubled
thoughts
to
take
a
nap
Lest

tomorrow
When
I
should
mount
with
wings
of
victory
Once
more

Thou

account
myself
Look

my

with
a
gracious

Put

Thy
bruising
irons
of
wrath
That
they
may
crush
down
with
a
heavy
fall
The
usurping
helmets
of
our
adversaries
Make
us
Thy
ministers
of
chastisement
That
we
may
praise
Thee
in
the
victory
To
Thee
I
do
commend
my
watchful
soul
Ere

Lest

Alack

Wherefore
For

That
I

Alas

For

I

Fool
of

Fool
do
not

My
conscience
hath
a
thousand
several
tongues
And
every
tongue
brings
in
a
several
tale
And
every
tale
condemns
me
for
a
villain
Perjury
perjury
in
the
highst
degree
Murder
stern

degree
All
several

Throng

Guilty
guilty
I
shall
despair
There
is
no

And
if
I

no
soul
will
pity
me
And
wherefore
should
they
since
that
I
myself
Find
in
myself
no
pity
to
myself
Methought
the
souls
of
all
that
I
had
murderd
Came
to
my
tent
and
every
one
did
threat
Tomorrows
vengeance
on
the
head
of
Richard
Enter
My
lord
Zounds
who
is
there
Ratcliff
my
lord
tis
I
The
early
villagecock
Hath
twice
done
salutation
to
the
morn
Your
friends
are
up
and
buckle
on
their
armour
Ratcliff
I
have
dreamd
a
fearful
dream
What
thinkst
thouwill
our
friends
prove
all
true
No
doubt
my
lord
Ratcliff
I
fear
I
fear
Nay
good
my
lord
be
not
afraid
of
shadows
By
the
apostle
Paul
shadows
tonight
Have
stuck
more
terror
to
the
soul
of
Richard
Than
can
the
substance
of
ten
thousand
soldiers
Armed
in
proof
and
led
by
shallow
Richmond
Tis
not
yet
near
day
Come
go
with
me
Under
our
tents
Ill
play
the
eavesdropper
To
see
if
any
mean
to
shrink
from
me
Enter
the
to
sitting
in
his
tent
Good
morrow
Richmond
Cry
mercy
lords
and
watchful
gentlemen
That
you
have
taen
a
tardy
sluggard
here
How
have
you
slept
my
lord
The
sweetest
sleep
and
fairestboding
dreams
That
ever
entred
in
a
drowsy
head
Have
I
since
your
departure
had
my
lords
Methought
their
souls
whose
bodies
Richard
murderd
Came
to
my
tent
and
cried
on
victory
I
promise
you
my
soul
is
very
jocund
In
the
remembrance
of
so
fair
a
dream
How
far
into
the
morning
is
it
lords
Upon
the
stroke
of
four
Why
then
tis
time
to
arm
and
give
direction
His
to
his
More
than
I
have
said
loving
countrymen
The
leisure
and
enforcement
of
the
time
Forbids
to
dwell
upon
yet
remember
this
God
and
our
good
cause
fight
upon
our
side
The
prayers
of
holy
saints
and
wronged
souls
Like
highreard
bulwarks
stand
before
our
faces
Richard
except
those
whom
we
fight
against
Had
rather
have
us
win
than
him
they
follow
For
what
is
he
they
follow
Truly
gentlemen
bloody
tyrant
and
a
homicide
One
raisd
in
blood
and
one
in
blood
establishd
One
that
made
means
to
come
by
what
he
hath
And
slaughtered
those
that
were
the
means
to
help
him
base
foul
stone
made
precious
by
the
foil
Of
Englands
chair
where
he
is
falsely
set
One
that
hath
ever
been
Gods
enemy
Then
if
you
fight
against
Gods
enemy
God
will
in
justice
ward
you
as
his
soldiers
If
you
do
sweat
to
put
a
tyrant
down
You
sleep
in
peace
the
tyrant
being
slain
If
you
do
fight
against
your
countrys
foes
Your
countrys
foes
shall
pay
your
pains
the
hire
If
you
do
fight
in
safeguard
of
your
wives
Your
wives
shall
welcome
home
the
conquerors
If
you
do
free
your
children
from
the
sword
Your
childrens
children
quits
it
in
your
age
Then
in
the
name
of
God
and
all
these
rights
Advance
your
standards
draw
your
willing
swords
For
me
the
ransom
of
my
bold
attempt
Shall
be
this
cold
corpse
on
the
earths
cold
face
But
if
I
thrive
the
gain
of
my
attempt
The
least
of
you
shall
share
his
part
thereof
Sound
drums
and
trumpets
boldly
and
cheerfully
God
and
Saint
George
Richmond
and
victory
Reenter
attendants
and
forces
What
said
Northumberland
as
touching
Richmond
That
he
was
never
trained
up
in
arms
He
said
the
truth
and
what
said
Surrey
then
He
smild
and
said
The
better
for
our
purpose
He
was
in
the
right
and
so
indeed
it
is
Clock
strikes
Tell
the
clock
there
Give
me
a
calendar
Who
saw
the
sun
today
Not
I
my
lord
Then
he
disdains
to
shine
for
by
the
book
He
should
have
bravd
the
east
an
hour
ago
black
day
will
it
be
to
somebody
Ratcliff
My
lord
The
sun
will
not
be
seen
today
The
sky
doth
frown
and
lour
upon
our
army
I
would
these
dewy
tears
were
from
the
ground
Not
shine
today
Why
what
is
that
to
me
More
than
to
Richmond
For
the
selfsame
heaven
That
frowns
on
me
looks
sadly
upon
him
Enter
Arm

my
lord
the
foe
vaunts
in
the
field
Come
bustle

caparison
my

Call
up
Lord
Stanley
bid
him
bring
his
power
I
will
lead
forth
my
soldiers
to
the
plain
And
thus
my
battle
shall
be
ordered
My
foreward
shall
be
drawn
out
all
in
length
Consisting
equally
of
horse
and
foot
Our
archers
shall
be
placed
in
the
midst
John
Duke
of
Norfolk
Thomas
Earl
of
Surrey
Shall
have
the
leading
of
this
foot
and
horse
They
thus
directed
we
will
follow
In
the
main
battle
whose
puissance
on
either
side
Shall
be
well
winged
with
our
chiefest
horse
This
and
Saint
George
to
boot
What
thinkst
thou
Norfolk
good

warlike
sovereign
This

I
on
my
tent
this
morning
He

Reads
Jockey

bold
For
Dickon
thy

thing
devised
by
the
enemy
Go
gentlemen
every
man
unto
his
charge
Let
not
our
babbling
dreams
affright
our
souls
Conscience
is
but
a
word
that
cowards
use
Devisd
at
first
to
keep
the
strong
in
awe
Our
strong
arms
be
our

our

March
on

let
us
to
it
pellmell
If
not
to

then

His
to

What
shall
I
say
more
than
I
have
inferrd
Remember
whom
you
are
to
cope
withal
sort
of
vagabonds
rascals
and
runaways
scum
of
Britaines
and
base
lackey
peasants
Whom
their
oercloyed
country
vomits
forth
To
desperate
adventures
and
assurd
destruction
You
sleeping
safe
they
bring
to
you
unrest
You
having
lands
and
blessd
with
beauteous
wives
They
would
restrain
the
one
distain
the
other
And
who
doth
lead
them
but
a
paltry
fellow
Long
kept
in
Britaine
at
our
mothers
cost
milksop
one
that
never
in
his
life
Felt
so
much
cold
as
over
shoes
in
snow
Lets
whip
these
stragglers
oer
the
seas
again
Lash
hence
these
overweening
rags
of
France
These
famishd
beggars
weary
of
their
lives
Who
but
for
dreaming
on
this
fond
exploit
For
want
of
means
poor
rats
had
hangd
themselves
If
we
be
conquered
let
men
conquer
us
And
not
these
bastard
Britaines
whom
our
fathers
Have
in
their
own
land
beaten
bobbd
and
thumpd
And
in
record

Alla

casa
ben

Molto
honorato
signor
mio
Petruchio
Rise
Grumio

this
quarrel
Nay

lawful
cause
for
me
to
leave
his
service
look

sir
he
bid
me
knock
him
and

sir
Well
was
it
fit
for
a
servant
to
use
his
master
so
being
perhaps
for
aught
I
see
two
and
thirty
a
pip
out
Whom
would
to
God
I
had
well
knockd
at
first
Then
had
not
Grumio
come
by
the
worst
senseless
villain
Good
Hortensio
I
bade
the
rascal
knock
upon
your
gate
And
could
not
get
him
for
my
heart
to

it
Knock

gate
heavens
Spake

words
plain
Sirrah

well
and
knock

And

with
knocking
at
the
gate
Sirrah
be
gone
or

not
I
advise
you
Petruchio
patience
I
am
Grumios
pledge
Why
thiss
a
heavy
chance
twixt
him
and
you
Your
ancient
trusty
pleasant
servant
Grumio
And
tell
me
now
sweet
friend
what
happy
gale
Blows
you
to
Padua
here
from
old
Verona
Such
wind
as
scatters
young
men
through
the
world
To
seek
their
fortunes
farther
than
at
home
Where
small
experience
grows
But
in
a
few
Signior
Hortensio
thus
it
stands
with
me
Antonio
my
father
is
deceasd
And
I
have
thrust
myself
into
this
maze
Haply
to
wive
and
thrive
as
best
I
may
Crowns
in
my
purse
I
have
and
goods
at
home
And
so
am
come
abroad
to
see
the
world
Petruchio
shall
I
then
come
roundly
to
thee
And
wish
thee
to
a
shrewd
illfavourd
wife
Thoudst
thank
me
but
a
little
for
my
counsel
And
yet
Ill
promise
thee
she
shall
be
rich
And
very
rich
but
thart
too
much
my
friend
And
Ill
not
wish
thee
to
her
Signior
Hortensio
twixt
such
friends
as
we
Few
words
suffice
and
therefore
if
thou
know
One
rich
enough
to
be
Petruchios
wife
As
wealth
is
burden
of
my
wooing
dance
Be
she
as
foul
as
was
Florentius
love
As
old
as
Sibyl
and
as
curst
and
shrewd
As
Socrates
Xanthippe
or
a
worse
She
moves
me
not
or
not
removes
at
least
Affections
edge
in
me
were
she
as
rough
As
are
the
swelling
Adriatic
seas
I
come
to
wive
it
wealthily
in
Padua
If
wealthily
then
happily
in
Padua
Nay
look
you
sir
he
tells
you
flatly
what
his
mind
is
Why
give
him
gold
enough
and
marry
him
to
a
puppet
or
an
agletbaby
or
an
old
trot
with
neer
a
tooth
in
her
head
though
she
has
as
many
diseases
as
two
and
fifty
horses
Why
nothing
comes
amiss
so
money
comes
withal
Petruchio
since
we
are
steppd
thus
far
in
I
will
continue
that
I
broachd
in
jest
I
can
Petruchio
help
thee
to
a
wife
With
wealth
enough
and
young
and
beauteous
Brought
up
as
best
becomes
a
gentlewoman
Her
only
fault
and
that
is
faults
enough
Is
that
she
is
intolerable
curst
And
shrewd
and
froward
so
beyond
all
measure
That
were
my
state
far
worser
than
it
is
I
would
not
wed
her
for
a
mine
of
gold
Hortensio
peace
thou
knowst
not
golds
effect
Tell
me
her
fathers
name
and
tis
enough
For
I
will
board
her
though
she
chide
as
loud
As
thunder
when
the
clouds
in
autumn
crack
Her
father
is
Baptista
Minola
An
affable
and
courteous
gentleman
Her
name
is
Katherina
Minola
Renownd
in
Padua
for
her
scolding
tongue
I
know
her
father
though
I
know
not
her
And
he
knew
my
deceased
father
well
I
will
not
sleep
Hortensio
till
I
see
her
And
therefore
let
me
be
thus
bold
with
you
To
give
you
over
at
this
first
encounter
Unless
you
will
accompany
me
thither
I
pray
you
sir
let
him
go
while
the
humour
lasts
my
word
and
she
knew
him
as
well
as
I
do
she
would
think
scolding
would
do
little
good
upon
him
She
may
perhaps
call
him
half
a
score
knaves
or
so
Why
thats
nothing
and
he
begin
once
hell
rail
in
his
ropetricks
Ill
tell
you
what
sir
an
she
stand
him
but
a
little
he
will
throw
a
figure
in
her
face
and
so
disfigure
her
with
it
that
she
shall
have
no
more
eyes
to
see
withal
than
a
cat
You
know
him
not
sir
Tarry
Petruchio
I
must
go
with
thee
For
in
Baptistas
keep
my
treasure
is
He
hath
the
jewel
of
my
life
in
hold
His
youngest
daughter
beautiful
Bianca
And
her
withholds
from
me
and
other
more
Suitors
to
her
and
rivals
in
my
love
Supposing
it
a
thing
impossible
For
those
defects
I
have
before
rehearsd
That
ever
Katherina
will
be
wood
Therefore
this
order
hath
Baptista
taen
That
none
shall
have
access
unto
Bianca
Till
Katherine
the
curst
have
got
a
husband
Katherine
the
curst
title
for
a
maid
of
all
titles
the
worst
Now
shall
my
friend
Petruchio
do
me
grace
And
offer
me
disguisd
in
sober
robes
To
old
Baptista
as
a
schoolmaster
Well
seen
in
music
to
instruct
Bianca
That
so
I
may
by
this
device
at
least
Have
leave
and
leisure
to
make
love
to
her
And
unsuspected
court
her
by
herself
Enter
with
disguised
as
Heres
no
knavery
See
to
beguile
the
old
folks
how
the
young
folks
lay
their
heads
together
Master
master
look
about
you
Who
goes
there
ha
Peace
Grumio
It
is
the
rival
of
my
love
Petruchio
stand
by
awhile
proper
stripling
and
an
amorous
They
stand
aside
very
well
I
have
perusd
the
note
Hark
you
sir
Ill
have
them
very
fairly
bound
All
books
of
love
see
that
at
any
hand
And
see
you
read
no
other
lectures
to
her
You
understand
me
over
and
beside
Signior
Baptistas
liberality
Ill
mend
it
with
a
largess
Take
your
paper
too
And
let
me
have
them
very
well
perfumd
For
she
is
sweeter
than
perfume
itself
To
whom
they
go
to
What
will
you
read
to
her
Whateer
I
read
to
her
Ill
plead
for
you
As
for
my
patron
stand
you
so
assurd
As
firmly
as
yourself
were
still
in
place
Yea
and
perhaps
with
more
successful
words
Than
you
unless
you
were
a
scholar
sir
this
learning
what
a
thing
it
is
this
woodcock
what
an
ass
it
is
Peace
sirrah
Grumio
mum
Coming
forward
God
save
you
Signior
Gremio
And
you
are
well
met
Signior
Hortensio
Trow
you
whither
I
am
going
To
Baptista
Minola
I
promisd
to
enquire
carefully
About
a
schoolmaster
for
the
fair
Bianca
And
by
good
fortune
I
have
lighted
well
On
this
young
man
for
learning
and
behaviour
Fit
for
her
turn
well
read
in
poetry
And
other
books
good
ones
I
warrant
ye
Tis
well
and
I
have
met
a
gentleman
Hath
promisd
me
to
help
me
to
another
fine
musician
to
instruct
our
mistress
So
shall
I
no
whit
be
behind
in
duty
To
fair
Bianca
so
beloved
of
me
Beloved
of
me
and
that
my
deeds
shall
prove
And
that
his
bags
shall
prove
Gremio
tis
now
no
time
to
vent
our
love
Listen
to
me
and
if
you
speak
me
fair
Ill
tell
you
news
indifferent
good
for
either
Here
is
a
gentleman
whom
by
chance
I
met
Upon
agreement
from
us
to
his
liking
Will
undertake
to
woo
curst
Katherine
Yea
and
to
marry
her
if
her
dowry
please
So
said
so
done
is
well
Hortensio
have
you
told
him
all
her
faults
I
know
she
is
an
irksome
brawling
scold
If
that
be
all
masters
I
hear
no
harm
No
sayst
me
so
friend
What
countryman
Born
in
Verona
old
Antonios
son
My
father
dead
my
fortune
lives
for
me
And
I
do
hope
good
days
and
long
to
see
Sir
such
a
life
with
such
a
wife
were
strange
But
if
you
have
a
stomach
tot
a
Gods
name
You
shall
have
me
assisting
you
in
all
But
will
you
woo
this
wildcat
Will
I
live
Will
he
woo
her
Ay
or
Ill
hang
her
Why
came
I
hither
but
to
that
intent
Think
you
a
little
din
can
daunt
mine
ears
Have
I
not
in
my
time
heard
lions
roar
Have
I
not
heard
the
sea
puffd
up
with
winds
Rage
like
an
angry
boar
chafed
with
sweat
Have
I
not
heard
great
ordnance
in
the
field
And
heavens
artillery
thunder
in
the
skies
Have
I
not
in
a
pitched
battle
heard
Loud
larums
neighing
steeds
and
trumpets
clang
And
do
you
tell
me
of
a
womans
tongue
That
gives
not
half
so
great
a
blow
to
hear
As
will
a
chestnut
in
a
fariners
fire
Tush
tush
fear
boys
with
bugs
For
he
fears
none
Hortensio
hark
This
gentleman
is
happily
arrivd
My
mind
presumes
for
his
own
good
and
ours
I
promisd
we
would
be
contributors
And
bear
his
charge
of
wooing
whatsoeer
And
so
we
will
provided
that
he
win
her
I
would
I
were
as
sure
of
a
good
dinner
Enter
bravely
apparelled
as
and
Gentlemen
God
save
you
If
I
may
be
bold
Tell
me
I
beseech
you
which
is
the
readiest
way
To
the
house
of
Signior
Baptista
Minola
He
that
has
the
two
fair
daughters
ist
he
you
mean
Even
he
Biondello
Hark

not
her
to
Perhaps
him
and
her
sir
what
have
you
to
do
Not

at
any
hand
I
pray
I
love
no
chiders
sir
Biondello
lets
away
Aside
Well
begun
Tranio
Sir
a
word
ere
you
go
Are
you
a
suitor
to
the
maid
you
talk
of
yea
or
no
And
if
I
be
sir
is
it
any
offence
No
if
without
more
words
you
will
get
you
hence
Why
sir
I
pray
are
not
the
streets
as
free
For
me
as
for
you
But
so
is
not
she
For
what
reason
I
beseech
you
For
this
reason
if
youll
know
That
shes
the
choice
love
of
Signior
Gremio
That
shes
the
chosen
of
Signior
Hortensio
Softly
my
masters
If
you
be
gentlemen
Do
me
this
right
hear
me
with
patience
Baptista
is
a
noble
gentleman
To
whom
my
father
is
not
all
unknown
And
were
his
daughter
fairer
than
she
is
She
may
more
suitors
have
and
me
for
one
Fair
Ledas
daughter
had
a
thousand
wooers
Then
well
one
more
may
fair
Bianca
have
And
so
she
shall
Lucentio
shall
make
one
Though
Paris
came
in
hope
to
speed
alone
What
this
gentleman
will
outtalk
us
all
Sir
give
him
head
I
know
hell
prove
a
jade
Hortensio
to
what
end
are
all
these
words
Sir
let
me
be
so
bold
as
ask
you
Did
you
yet
ever
see
Baptistas
daughter
No
sir
but
hear
I
do
that
he
hath
two
The
one
as
famous
for
a
scolding
tongue
As
is
the
other
for
beauteous
modesty
Sir
sir
the
firsts
for
me
let
her
go
by
Yea
leave
that
labour
to
great
Hercules
And
let
it
be
more
than
Alcides
twelve
Sir
understand
you
this
of
me
in
sooth
The
youngest
daughter
whom
you
hearken
for
Her
father
keeps
from
all
access
of
suitors
And
will
not
promise
her
to
any
man
Until
the
elder
sister
first
be
wed
The
younger
then
is
free
and
not
before
If
it
be
so
sir
that
you
are
the
man
Must
stead
us
all
and
me
amongst
the
rest
And
if
you
break
the
ice
and
do
this
feat
Achieve
the
elder
set
the
younger
free
For
our
access
whose
hap
shall
be
to
have
her
Will
not
so
graceless
be
to
be
ingrate
Sir
you
say
well
and
well
you
do
conceive
And
since
you
do
profess
to
be
a
suitor
You
must
as
we
do
gratify
this
gentleman
To
whom
we
all
rest
generally
beholding
Sir
I
shall
not
be
slack
in

grateful

am
sure
of
it
To
express
the
like
kindness
myself
that
have
been
more
kindly
beholding
to

than

give
unto

this
young

Pardon

That
being
a
stranger
in
this
city
here
Do
make
myself
a
suitor
to
your
daughter
Unto
Bianca
fair
and
virtuous
Nor
is
your
firm
resolve
unknown
to
me
In
the
preferment
of
the
eldest
sister
This
liberty
is
all
that
I
request
That
upon
knowledge
of
my
parentage
I
may
have
welcome
mongst
the
rest
that
woo
And
free
access
and
favour

And
toward
the
education
of
your
daughters
I
here
bestow
a
simple
instrument
And
this
small
packet
of
Greek
and
Latin
books
If
you
accept
them
then
their
worth
is
great
Lucentio
is
your
name
Of
whence
I
pray
Of
Pisa
sir
son
to
Vincentio
mighty
man
of
Pisa
By
report
I

You

welcome
sir
Take

books
You

your
pupils

Holla
within
Enter
a
Sirrah
lead
these
gentlemen
To
my
daughters
and
tell
them
both
These
are
their
tutors
Bid
them
use
them
well
and
with
the
books
We
will
go
walk
a
little
in
the
orchard
And
then
to
dinner
You
are
passing
welcome
And
so
I
pray
you
all
to
think
yourselves
Signior
Baptista
my
business
asketh
haste
And
every
day
I
cannot
come
to
woo
You
knew
my
father
well
and
in
him
me
Left
solely
heir
to
all
his
lands
and
goods
Which
I
have
bettered
rather
than
decreasd
Then
tell
me
if
I
get
your
daughters
love
What
dowry
shall
I
have
with
her
to
wife
After
my
death
the
one
half
of
my
lands
And
in
possession
twenty
thousand
crowns
And
for
that
dowry
Ill
assure
her
of
Her
widowhood
be
it
that
she
survive
me
In
all
my
lands
and
leases
whatsoever
Let
specialities
be
therefore
drawn
between
us
That
covenants
may
be
kept
on
either
hand
Ay
when
the
special
thing
is
well
obtaind
That
is
her
love
for
that
is
all
in
all
Why
that
is
nothing
for
I
tell
you
father
I
am
as
peremptory
as
she
proudminded
And
where
two
raging
fires
meet
together
They
do
consume
the
thing
that
feeds
their
fury
Though
little
fire
grows
great
with
little
wind
Yet
extreme
gusts
will
blow
out
fire
and
all
So
I
to
her
and
so
she
yields
to
me
For
I
am
rough
and
woo
not
like
a
babe
Well
mayst
thou
woo
and
happy
be
thy
speed
But
be
thou
armd
for
some
unhappy
words
Ay
to
the
proof
as
mountains
are
for
winds
That
shake
not
though
they
blow
perpetually
Reenter
with
his
head
broke
How
now
my
friend
Why
dost
thou
look
so
pale
For
fear
I
promise
you
if
I
look
pale
What
will
my
daughter
prove
a
good
musician
I
think
shell
sooner
prove
a
soldier
Iron
may
hold
with
her
but
never
lutes
Why
then
thou
canst
not
break
her
to
the
lute
Why
no
for
she
hath
broke
the
lute
to
me
I
did
but
tell
her
she
mistook
her
frets
And
bowd
her
hand
to
teach
her
fingering
When
with
a
most
impatient
devilish
spirit
Frets
call
you
these
quoth
she
Ill
fume
with
them
And
with
that
word
she
struck
me
on
the
head
And
through
the
instrument
my
pate
made
way
And
there
I
stood
amazed
for
a
while
As
on
a
pillory
looking
through
the
lute
While
she
did
call
me
rascal
fiddler
And
twangling
Jack
with
twenty
such
vile
terms
As
she
had
studied
to
misuse
me
so
Now
by
the
world
it
is
a
lusty
wench
I
love
her
ten
times
more
than
eer
I
did
how
I
long
to
have
some
chat
with
her
Well
go
with
me
and
be
not
so
discomfited
Proceed
in
practice
with
my
younger
daughter
Shes
apt
to
learn
and
thankful
for
good
turns
Signior
Petruchio
will
you
go
with
us
Or
shall
I
send
my
daughter
Kate
to
you
I
pray
you
do
Ill
attend
her
here
And
woo
her
with
some
spirit
when
she
comes
Say
that
she
rail
why
then
Ill
tell
her
plain
She
sings
as
sweetly
as
a
nightingale
Say
that
she
frown
Ill
say
she
looks
as
clear
As
morning
roses
newly
washd
with
dew
Say
she
be
mute
and
will
not
speak
a
word
Then
Ill
commend
her
volubility
And
say
she
uttereth
piercing
eloquence
If
she
do
bid
me
pack
Ill
give
her
thanks
As
though
she
bid
me
stay
by
her
a
week
If
she
deny
to
wed
Ill
crave
the
day
When
I
shall
ask
the
banns
and
when
be
married
But
here
she
comes
Lndnow
Petruchio
speak
Enter
Good

But

consolation
Hearing

mildness
praisd
in
every

Thy

Yet

belongs
Myself

Movd

good
time

Remove

Alas

Kate
I
will
not
burden
thee
For
knowing
thee
to
be
but
young
and
light
Too
light
for
such
a
swain
as
you
to
catch
And
yet
as
heavy
as
my
weight
should
be
Should
be
should
buzz
Well

and
like
a
buzzard
slowwingd

buzzard
take

Ay

buzzard
Come

faith
you
are
too
angry
If
I
be
waspish
best
beware
my
sting
My
remedy
is
then
to
pluck
it
out
Ay
if
the
fool
could
find
it
where
it
lies
Who
knows
not
where
a
wasp
does
wear
his
sting
In
his
tail
In
his
tongue
Whose
tongue
Yours
if
you
talk
of
tales
and
so
farewell
What
with
my
tongue
in
your
tail
Nay

Good
Kate
I
am
a
gentleman
That
Ill
try
She
strikes
him
I
swear
Ill
cuff
you
if
you
strike
again
So
may
you
lose
your
arms
If
you
strike
me
you
are
no
gentleman
And
if
no
gentleman
why
then
no
arms
herald
Kate
put
me
in
thy
books
What
is
your
crest
a
coxcomb
combless
cock
so
Kate
will
be
my
hen
No
cock
of
mine
you
crow
too
like
a
craven
Nay
come
Kate
come
you
must
not
look
so
sour
It
is
my
fashion
when
I
see
a
crab
Why
heres
no
crab
and
therefore
look
not
sour
There
is
there
is
Then
show
it
me
Had
I
a
glass
I
would
What
you
mean
my
face
Well
aimd
of
such
a
young
one
Now
by
Saint
George
I
am
too
young
for
you
Yet
you
are
witherd
Tis
with
cares
I
care
not
Nay
hear

Kate
in
sooth
you

No

you
passing
gentle
Twas
told
me
you
were
rough
and
coy
and
sullen
And
now
I
find
report
a
very
liar
For
thou
art
pleasant
gamesome
passing
courteous
But
slow
in
speech
yet
sweet
as
springtime
flowers
Thou
canst
not
frown
thou
canst
not
look
askance
Nor
bite
the
lip
as
angry
wenches
will
Nor
hast
thou
pleasure
to
be
cross
in
talk
But
thou
with
mildness
entertainst
thy
wooers
With
gentle
conference
soft
and
affable
Why
does
the
world
report
that
Kate
doth
limp
slandrous
world
Kate
like
the
hazeltwig
Is
straight
and
slender
and
as
brown
in
hue
As
hazelnuts
and
sweeter
than
the
kernels
let
me
see
thee
walk
Thou
dost
not
halt
Go
fool
and
whom
thou
keepst
command
Did
ever
Dian
so
become
a
grove
As
Kate
this
chamber
with
her
princely
gait
be
thou
Dian
and
let
her
be
Kate
And
then
let
Kate
be
chaste
and
Dian
sportful
Where
did
you
study
all
this
goodly
speech
It
is
extempore
from
my
mother
wit
witty
mother
witless
else
her
son
Am
I
not
wise
Yes
keep
you
warm
Marry
so
I
mean
sweet
Katherine
in
thy
bed
And
therefore
setting
all
this
chat
aside
Thus
in
plain
terms
your
father
hath
consented
That
you
shall
be
my
wife
your
dowry
greed
on
And
will
you
nill
you
I
will
marry
you
Now
Kate
I

your
turn
For

this
light
whereby
I
see
thy
beauty
Thy
beauty
that
doth
make
me
like
thee
well
Thou
must
be
married
to
no
man
but
me
For
I
am
he
am
born
to
tame
you
Kate
And
bring
you
from
a
wild
Kate
to
a
Kate
Conformable
as
other
household
Kates
Reenter
and
Here
comes
your
father
Never
make
denial
I
must
and
will
have
Katherine
to
my
wife
Now
Signior
Petruchio
how

my
daughter
How

impossible
I
should
speed

now
daughter
Katherine
in
your
dumps
Call
you
me
daughter
Now
I
promise
you
You
have
showd
a
tender
fatherly
regard
To
wish
me
wed

one
half
lunatic
madcap
ruffian
and
a
swearing
Jack
That

face
the
matter
out
Father

thus
yourself
and
all
the
world
That

of

talkd
amiss
of

If
she
be
curst
it
is
for
policy
Forshes
not
froward
but
modest
as
the
dove
She
is
not
hot
but
temperate
as
the
morn
For
patience
she
will
prove
a
second
Grissel
And
Roman
Lucrece
for
her
chastity
And

greed
so

Two

If

Well

And

I
take

thank
you

Adieu
good
neighbour
Now
I
fear
thee
not
Sirrah
young
gamester
your
father
were
a
fool
To
give
thee
all
and
in
his
waning
age
Set
foot
under
thy
table
Tut
a
toy
An
old
Italian
fox
is
not
so
kind
my
boy
vengeance
on
your
crafty
withered
hide
Yet
I
have
facd
it
with
a
card
of
ten
Tis
in
my
head
to
do
my
master
good
I
see
no
reason
but
supposd
Lucentio
Must
get
a
father
calld
supposd
Vincentio
And
thats
a
wonder
fathers
commonly
Do
get
their
children
but
in
this
case
of
wooing
child
shall
get
a
sire
if
I
fail
not
of
my
cunning
I
Padua
house
Enter
as
as
and
Fiddler
forbear
you
grow
too
forward
sir
Have
you
so
soon
forgot
the
entertainment
Her
sister
Katherine
welcomed
you
withal
But
wrangling
pedant
this
is
The
patroness
of
heavenly
harmony
Then
give
me
leave
to
have
prerogative
And
when
in
music
we
have
spent
an
hour
Your
lecture
shall
have
leisure
for
as
much
Preposterous
ass
that
never
read
so
far
To
know
the
cause
why
music
was
ordaind
Was
it
not
to
refresh
the
mind
of
man
After
his
studies
or
his
usual
pain
Then
give
me
leave
to
read
philosophy
And
while
I
pause
serve
in
your
harmony
Sirrah
I
will
not
bear
these
braves
of
thine
Why
gentlemen
you
do
me
double
wrong
To
strive
for
that
which
resteth
in
my
choice
I
arn
no
breeching
scholar
in
the
schools
Ill
not
be
tied
to
hours
nor
pointed
times
But
learn
my
lessons
as
I

myself
And
to
cut
off
all
strife

Take

Now

Ill

In

doubt
But

Now

Good

That

Well

And

Our
fine
musician

amorous
Madam
before
you
touch
the
instrument
To
learn
the
order
of
my
fingering
I
must
begin
with
rudiments
of
art
To
teach
you
gamut
in
a
briefer
sort
More
pleasant
pithy
and
effectual
Than
hath
been
taught
by
any
of
my
trade
And
there
it
is
in
writing
fairly
drawn
Why
I
am

gamut
long
ago
Yet

To

Enter

Farewell
sweet
masters

I
must
be
gone
Faith
mistress
then
I
have
no
cause
to
stay
But
I
have
cause
to
pry
into
this
pedant
Methinks
he
looks
as
though
he
were
in
love
Yet
if
thy
thoughts
Bianca
be
so
humble
To

Seize

in

manner
of
his
teaching
They
stand
aside
Enter
and
as
Now
mistress

in
what

What

First

me
that

The
Art
to
Love
And

of
your
art
While

Lucentio

unconstant
womankind
I
tell
thee
Licio
this
is
wonderful
Mistake
no
more
I
am
not
Licio
Nor
a
musician
as
I
seem
to
be
But
one
that
scorn
to
live
in
this
disguise
For
such
a
one
as
leaves
a
gentleman
And
makes
a
god
of
such
a
cullion
Know
sir
that
I
am
calld
Hortensio
Signior
Hortensio
I
have
often
heard
Of
your
entire
affection
to
Bianca
And
since
mine
eyes
are
witness
of
her
lightness
I
will
with
you
if
you
be
so
contented
Forswear
Bianca
and
her
love
for
ever
See
how
they
kiss
and
court
Signior
Lucentio
Here
is
my
hand
and
here
I
firmly
vow
Never
to
woo
her
more
but
do
forswear
her
As
one
unworthy
all
the
former
favours
That
I
have
fondly
flatterd
her
withal
And
here
I
take
the
like
unfeigned
oath
Never
to
marry
with
her
though
she
would
entreat
Fie
on
her
See
how
beastly
she
doth
court
him
Would
all
the
world
but
he
had
quite
forsworn
For
me
that
I
may
surely
keep
mine
oath
I
will
be
married
to
a
wealtlly
widow
Ere
three
days
pass
which
hath
as
long
lovd
me
As
I
have
lovd
this
proud
disdainful
haggard
And
so
farewell
Signior
Lucentio
Kindness
in
women
not
their
beauteous
looks
Shall
win
my
love
and
so
I
take
my
leave
In
resolution
as
I
swore
before
Mistress
Bianca
bless
you
with
such
grace
As
longeth
to
a
lovers
blessed
case
Nay
I
have
taen
you
napping
gentle
love
And
have
forsworn
you
with
Hortensio
Tranio
you
jest
but
have
you
both
forsworn
me
Mistress
we
have
Then
we
are
rid
of
Licio
I
faith
hell
have
a
lusty
widow
now
That
shall
be
wood
and
wedded
in
a
day
God
give
him
joy
Ay
and
hell
tame
her
He
says
so
Tranio
Faith
he
is
gone
unto
the
tamingschool
The
tamingschool
What
is
there
such
a
place
Ay
mistress
and
Petruchio
is
the
master
That
teacheth
tricks
eleven
and
twenty
long
To
tame
a
shrew
and
charm
her
chattering
tongue
Enter
master
master
have
watchd
so
long
That
I
am
dogweary
but
at
last
I
spied
An
ancient
angel
coming
down
the
hill
Will
serve
the
turn
What
is
he
Biondello
Master
a
mercatante
or
a
pedant
I
know
not
what
but
formal
in
apparel
In
gait
and
countenance
surely
like
a
father
And
what
of
him
Tranio
If
he
be
credulous
and
trust
my
tale
Ill
make
him
glad
to
seem
Vincentio
And
give
assurance
to
Baptista
Minola
As
if
he
were
the
right
Vincentio
Take
in
your
love
and
then
let
me
alone
Enter
a
God
save
you
sir
And
you

are
welcome
Travel
you
far
on
or
are
you
at
the
farthest
Sir
at
the
farthest
for
a
week
or
two
But
then
up
farther
and
as
far
as
Rome
And
so
to
Tripoli
if
God
lend
me
life
What
countryman
I
pray
Of
Mantua
Of
Mantua
sir
Marry
God
forbid
And
come
to
Padua
careless
of
your
life
My
life
sir
How
I
pray
For
that
goes
hard
Tis
death
for
any
one
in
Mantua
To
come
to
Padua
Know
you
not
the
cause
Your
ships
are
stayd
at
Venice
and
the
Duke
For
private
quarrel
twixt
your
Duke
and
him
Hath
publishd
and
proclaimd
it
openly
Tis
marvel
but
that
you
are
but
newly
come
You
might
have
heard
it
else
proclaimd
about
Alas

is
worse
for
me
than

For

have
heard
of

of
incomparable
wealth

and
sooth
to
say
In
countnance
somewhat
doth
resemble
you

As
much
as

apple
doth

oyster
and
all
one
To
save
your
life
in
this
extremity
This
favour
will
I
do
you
for
his
sake
And
think
it
not
the
worst
of
all
your
fortunes
That
you
are
like
to
Sir
Vincentio
His
name
and
credit
shall
you
undertake
And

you
shall
be
friendly

than
I
upon
some
agreement
Me
shall
you
find
ready
and
willing
With
one
consent
to
have
her
so
bestowd
For
curious
I
cannot
be
with
you
Signior
Baptista
of
whom
I
hear
so
well
Sir
pardon
me
in
what
I
have
to
say
Your
plainness
and
your
shortness
please
me
well
Right
true
it
is
your
son
Lucentio
here
Doth
love
my
daughter
and
she
loveth
him
Or
both
dissemble
deeply
their
affections
And
therefore
if
you
say
no
more
than
this
That
like
a
father
you
will
deal
with
him
And
pass
my
daughter
a
sufficient
dower
The
match
is
made
and
all
is
done
Your
son
shall
have
my
daughter
with
consent
I
thank
you
sir
Where
then
do
you
know
best
We
be
affied
and
such
assurance
taen
As
shall
with
either
parts
agreement
stand
Not
in
my
house
Lucentio
for
you
know
Pitchers
have
ears
and
I
have
many
servants
Besides
old
Gremio
is
hearkning
still
And
happily
we
might
be
interrupted
Then
at
my
lodging
an
it
like
you
There
doth
my
father
lie
and
there
this
night
Well
pass
the
business
privately
and
well
Send
for
your
daughter
by
your
servant
here
My
boy
shall
fetch
the
scrivener
presently
The
worst
is
this
that
at
so
slender
warning
You
are
like
to
have
a
thin
and
slender
pittance
It
likes
me
well
Cambio
hie
you
home
And
bid
Bianca
make
her
ready
straight
And
if
you
will
tell
what
hath
happened
Lucentios
father
is
arrivd
in
Padua
And
how
shes
like
to
be
Lucentios
wife
I
pray
the
gods
she
may
with
all
my
heart
Dally
not
with
the
gods
but
get
thee
gone
Signior
Baptista
shall
I
lead
the
way
Welcome
One
mess
is
like
to
be
your
cheer
Come
sir
we
will
better
it
in
Pisa
I
follow
you
Reenter
as
and
Cambio
What
sayst
thou
Biondello
You
saw
my
master
wink
and
laugh
upon
you
Biondello
what
of
that
Faith
nothing
but
has
left
me
here
behind
to
expound
the
meaning
or
moral
of
his
signs
and
tokens
I
pray
thee
moralize
them
Then
thus
Baptista
is
safe
talking
with
the
deceiving
father
of
a
deceitful
son
And
what
of
him
His
daughter
is
to
be
brought
by
you
to
the
supper
And
then
The
old
priest
at
Saint
Lukes
church
is
at
your
command
at
all
hours
And
what
of
all
this
I
cannot
tell
except
they
are
busied
about
a
counterfeit
assurance
Take
your
assurance
of
her
cum
privilegio
ad
imprimendum
solum
to
th
church
take
the
priest
clerk
and
some
sufficient
honest
witnesses
If
this
be
not
that
you
look
for
I
have
more
to
say
But
bid
Bianca
farewell
for
ever
and
a
day
Hearst
thou
Biondello
I
cannot
tarry
I
knew
a
wench
married
in
an
afternoon
as
she
went
to
the
garden
for
parsley
to
stuff
a
rabbit
and
so
may
you
sir
and
so
adieu
sir
My
master
hath
appointed
me
to
go
to
Saint
Lukes
to
bid
the
priest
be
ready
to
come
against
you
come
with
your
appendix
I
may
and
will
if
she
be
so
contented
She
will
be
pleasd
then
wherefore
should
I
doubt
Hap
what
hap
may
Ill
roundly
go
about
her
It
shall
go
hard
if
Cambio
go
without
her
house
Enter
the
and
The
with
and
bringing
in
a
banquet
At
last
though
long
our
jarring
notes
agree
And
time
it
is
when
raging
war
is
done
To
smile
at
scapes
and
perils
overblown
My
fair
Bianca
bid
my
father
welcome
While
I
with
selfsame
kindness
welcome
thine
Brother
Petruchio
sister
Katherina
And
thou
Hortensio
with
thy
loving
widow
Feast
with
the
best
and
welcome
to
my
house
My
banquet
is
to
close
our
stomachs
up
After
our
great
good
cheer
Pray
you
sit
down
For
now
we
sit
to
chat
as
well
as
eat
They
sit
Nothing
but
sit
and
sit
and
eat
and
eat
Padua
affords
this
kindness
son
Petruchio
Padua
affords
nothing
but
what
is
kind
For
both
our
sakes
I
would
that
word
were
true
Now
for
my
life
Hortensio
fears
his
widow
Then
never
trust
me
if
I
be
afeard
are
very
sensible
and
yet
you
miss
my
sense
I
mean
Hortensio
is
afeard
of
you
He
that
is
giddy
thinks
the
world
turns
round
Roundly
replied
Mistress
how
mean
you
that
Thus
I
conceive
by
him
Conceives
by
me
How
likes
Hortensio
that
My
widow
says
thus
she
conceives
her
tale
Very
well
mended
Kiss
him
for
that
good
widow
He
that
is
giddy
thinks
the
world
turns
round
I
pray
you
tell
me
what
you
meant
by
that
Your
husband
being
troubled
with
a
shrew
Measures
my
husbands
sorrow
by
his
woe
And
now
you
know
my
meaning
very
mean
meaning
Right
I
mean
you
And
I
am
mean
indeed
respecting
you
To
her
Kate
To
her
widow
hundred
marks
my
Kate
does
put
her
down
Thats
my
office
Spoke
like
an
officer

thee
lad
Drinks

How
likes
Gremio
these
quickwitted
folks
Believe
me
sir
they
butt
together
well
Head

butt
An
hastywitted
body
Would
say
your
head
and
butt
were
head
and
horn
Ay
mistress
bride

that
awakened
you
Ay
but
not
frighted
me
therefore
Ill
sleep
again
Nay
that
you
shall

you
have
begun
Have
at
you
for
a
bitter
jest
or
two
Am
I
your
bird
I
mean
to
shift
my
bush
And
then
pursue
me
as
you
draw
your
bow
You
are
welcome
all
She
hath
prevented
me
Here
Signior
Tranio
This
bird

Therefore

Lucentio

Which

swift
simile

currish
Tis

Now

good
sadness
son
Petruchio
I
think
thou

the
veriest
shrew
of
all
Well

and
therefore
for
assurance
Lets
each
one
send
unto
his

To

mistress

word
That
she
is
busy
and

How
Shes

she
cannot
come
Is

an
answer
Ay

a
kind
one
too
Pray
God

your
wife

worse
I
hope

Sirrah
Biondello

entreat
my
wife
To

to
me
forthwith
ho
entreat

Nay

yours

entreated
Reenter
Now

my
wife
She
says

some
goodly
jest

She

she
bids
you

Worse
and

vile
Intolerable
not

be
endurd
Sirrah
Grumio

mistress
Say

end
Reenter
Now
by
my
holidame
here
comes
Katherina
What
is
your
sir
that
you
send
for
me
Where
is
your
sister
and
Hortensios
wife
They
sit
conferring
by
the
parlour
fire
Go
fetch
them
hither
if
they
deny
to
come
Swinge
me
them
soundly
forth
unto
their
husbands
Away
I
say
and
bring
them
hither
straight
Here
is
a
wonder
if
you
talk
of
a
wonder
And
so
it
is
I
wonder
what
it
bodes
Marry
peace
it
bodes
and
love
and
quiet
life
An
awful
rule
and
right
supremacy
And
to
be
short
what
not
thats
sweet
and
happy
Now
fair
befall
thee
good
Petruchio
The
wager
thou
hast
won
and
I
will
ad
Unto
their
losses
twenty
thousand
crowns
Another
dowry
to
another
daughter
For
she
is
changd
as
she
had
never
been
Nay
I
will
win
my
wager
better
yet
And
show
more
sign
of
her
obedience
Her
newbuilt
virtue
and
obedience
Reenter
with
and
See
where
she
comes
and
brings
your
froward
wives
As
prisoners
to
her
womanly
persuasion
Katherine
that
cap
of
yours
becomes
you
not
Off
with
that
bauble
throw
it
underfoot
complies
Lord
let
me
never
have
a
cause
to
sigh
Till
I
be
brought
to
such
a
silly
pass
Fie
what
a
foolish
duty
call
you
this
I
would
your
duty
were
as
foolish
too
The
wisdom
of
your
duty
fair
Bianca
Hath
cost
me
a
hundred
crowns
since
suppertime
The
more
fool
you
for
laying
on
my
duty
Katherine
I
charge
thee
tell
these
headstrong
women
What
duty
they
do
owe
their
lords
and
husbands
Come
come
youre
mocking
we
will
have
no
telling
Come
on
I
say
and
first
begin
with
her
She
shall
not
I
say
she
shall
And
first
begin
with
her
Fie
fie
unknit
that
threatening
unkind
brow
And
dart
not
scornful
glances
from
those
eyes
To
wound
thy
lord
thy
king
thy
governor
It
blots
thy
beauty
as
frosts
do
bite
the
meads
Confounds
thy
fame
as
whirlwinds
shake
fair
buds
And
in
no
sense
is
meet
or
amiable
woman
movd
is
like
a
fountain
troubled
Muddy
illseeming
thick
bereft
of
beauty
And
while
it
is
so
none
so
dry
or
thirsty
Will
deign
to
sip
or
touch
one
drop
of
it
Thy
husband
is
thy
lord
thy
life
thy
keeper
Thy
head
thy
sovereign
one
that
cares
for
thee
And
for
thy
maintenance
commits
his
body
To
painful
labour
both
by
sea
and
land
To
watch
the
night
in
storms
the
day
in
cold
Whilst
thou
liest
warm
at
home
secure
and
safe
And
craves
no
other
tribute
at
thy
hands
But
love
fair
looks
and
true
obedience
Too
little
payment
for
so
great
a
debt
Such
duty
as
the
subject
owes
the
prince
Even
such
a
woman
oweth
to
her
husband
And
when
she
is
froward
peevish
sullen
sour
And
not
obedient
to
his
honest
will
What
is
she
but
a
foul
contending
rebel
And
graceless
traitor
to
her
loving
lord
I
am
ashamd
that
women
are
so
simple
To
offer
war
where
they
should
kneel
for
peace
Or
seek
for
rule
supremacy
and
sway
When
they
are
bound
to
serve
love
and
obey
Why
are
our
bodies
soft
and
weak
and
smooth
Unapt
to
toll
and
trouble
in
the
world
But
that
our
soft
conditions
and
our
hearts
Should
well
agree
with
our
external
parts
Come
come
you
froward
and
unable
worms
My
mind
hath
been
as
big
as
one
of
yours
My
heart
as
great
my
reason
haply
more
To
bandy
word
for
word
and
frown
for
frown
But
now
I
see
our
lances
are
but
straws
Our
strength
as
weak
our
weakness
past
compare
That
seeming
to
be
most
which
we
indeed
least
are
Then
vail
your
stomachs
for
it
is
no
boot
And
place
your
hands
below
your
husbands
foot
In
token
of
which
duty
if
he
please
My
hand
is
ready
may
it
do
him
ease
Why

Come
on

kiss

Well

And
after
bite
me
then
like
hedgehogs
which
Lie
tumbling
in
my
barefoot
way
and
mount
Their
pricks
at
my
footfall
sometime
am
I
All
wound
with
adders
who
with
cloven
tongues
Do
hiss
me
into
madness
Enter
Lo
now
lo
Here
comes
a
spirit
of
his
and
to
torment
me
For
bringing
wood
in
slowly
Ill
fall
flat
Perchance
he
will
not
mind
me
Heres
neither
bush
nor
shrub
to
bear
off
any
weather
at
all
and
another
storm
brewing
I
hear
it
sing
i
th
wind
Yond
same
black
cloud
yond
huge
one
looks
like
a
foul
bombard
that
would
shed
his
liquor
If
it
should
thunder
as
it
did
before
I
know
not
where
to
hide
my
head
Yond
same
cloud
cannot
choose
but
fall
by
pailfuls
What
have
we
here
a
man
or
a
fish
dead
or
alive
fish
he
smells
like
a
fish
a
very
ancient
and
fishlike
smell
kind
of
notofthenewest
PoorJohn
strange
fish
Were
I
in
England
now
as
once
I
was
and
had
but
this
fish
painted
not
a
holiday
fool
there
but
would
give
a
piece
of
silver
There
would
this
monster
make
a
man
any
strange
beast
there
makes
a
man
when
they
will
not
give
a
doit
to
relieve
a
lame
beggar
they
will
lay
out
ten
to
see
a
dead
Indian
Leggd
like
a
man
and
his
fins
like
arms
Warm
o
my
troth
I
do
now
let
loose
my
opinion
hold
it
no
longer
this
is
no
fish
but
an
islander
that
hath
lately
suffered
by
thunderbolt
Thunder
Alas
the
storm
is
come
again
My
best
way
is
to
creep
under
his
gaberdine
there
is
no
other
shelter
hereabout
Misery
acquaints
a
man
with
strange
bedfellows
I
will
here
shroud
till
the
dregs
of
the
storm
be
past
Enter
singing
a
bottle
in
his
hand
I
shall
no
more
to
sea
to
sea
Here
shall
I
die
ashore
This
is
a
very
scurvy
tune
to
sing
at
a
mans
funeral

Would
cry

Go

She

Yet
a

might
scratch
her
whereer
she
did
itch
Then

This

The

This

isle
with
four

who
hath
got
as
I
take
it
an
ague
Where
the
devil
should
he
learn
our
language
I
will
give
him
some
relief
if

If
I

tame
and

wisest
He
shall
taste
of
my
bottle
if
he
have
never
drunk
wine
afore

will
go
near
to
remove
his
fit
If
I
can
recover

I

not
take
too
much
for

Four

and
two
voices
a
most
delicate
monster
His
forward
voice
now
is
to
speak
well
of
his
friend
his
backward
voice
is
to
utter
foul
speeches
and
to
detract
If

wine
in

bottle
will
recover
him
I
will
help
his

Before

Enter
hearing
a
log
There
be
some
sports
are
painful
and
their
labour
Delight
in
them
sets
off
some
kinds
of
baseness
Are
nobly
undergone
and
most
poor
matters
Point
to
rich
ends
This
my
mean
task
Would
be
as
heavy
to
me
as
odious
but
The
mistress
which
I
serve
quickens
whats
dead
And
makes
my
labours
pleasures
she
is
Ten
times
more
gentle
than
her
fathers
crabbed
And
hes
composd
of
harshness
I
must
remove
Some
thousands
of
these
logs
and
pile
them
up
Upon
a
sore
injunction
my
sweet
mistress
Weeps
when
she
sees
me
work
and
says
such
baseness
Had
never
like
executor
I
forget
But
these
sweet
thoughts
do
even
refresh
my
labours
Most
busy
least
when
I
do
it
Enter
and
at
a
distance
unseen
Alas
now
pray
you
Work
not
so
hard
I
would
the
lightning
had
Burnt
up
those
logs
that
you
are
enjoind
to
pile
Pray
set
it
down
and
rest
you
when
this
burns
Twill
weep
for
having
wearied
you
My
father
Is
hard
at
study
pray
now
rest
yourself
Hes
safe
for
these
three
hours
most
dear
mistress
The
sun
will
set
before
I
shall
discharge
What
I
must
strive
to
do
If
youll
sit
down
Ill
bear
your
logs
the
while
pray
give
me
that
Ill
carry
it
to
the
pile
No
precious
creature
I
had
rather
crack
my
sinews
break
my
back
Than
you
should
such
dishonour
undergo
While
I
sit
lazy
by
It
would
become
me
As
well
as
it
does
you
and
I
should
do
it
With
much
more
ease
for
my
good
will
is
to
it
And
yours
it
is

Aside
Poor
worm
thou
art
infected
This
visitation

You
look
wearily
No
noble
mistress
tis
fresh
morning
with
me
When
you
are
by
at
night
I
do
beseech
you
Chiefly
that
I
might
set
it
in
my
prayers
What
is
your
name
MirandaO
my
father
I
have
broke
your
hest
to
say
so
Admird
Miranda
Whats
dearest
to
the
world
Full
many
a
lady
I
have
eyd
with
best
regard
and
many
a
time
Th
harmony
of
their
tongues
hath
into
bondage
Brought
my
too
diligent
ear
for
several
virtues
Have
I
likd
several
women
never
any
With
so
full
soul
but
some
defect
in
her
Did
quarrel
with
the
noblest
grace
she
owd
And
put
it
to
the
foil
but
you
you
So
perfect
and
so
peerless
are
created
Of
every
creatures
best
I
do
not
know
One
of
my
sex
no
womans
face
remember
Save
from
my
glass
mine
own
nor
have
I
seen
More
that
I
may
call
men
than
you
good
friend
And
my
dear
father
How
features
are
abroad
I
am
skilless
of
but
by
my
modesty
The
jewel
in
my
dower
I
would
not
wish
Any
companion
in
the
world
but
you
Nor
can
imagination
form
a
shape
Besides
yourself
to
like
of
But
I
prattle
Something
too
wildly
and
my
fathers
precepts
I
therein
do
forget
I
am
in
my
condition
prince
Miranda
I
do
think
a
king
I
would
not
soand
would
no
more
endure
This
wooden
slavery
than
to
suffer
The
fleshfly
blow
my
mouth
Hear
my
soul
speak
The
very
instant
that
I
saw
you
did
My
heart
fly
to
your
service
there
resides
To
make
me
slave
to
it
and
for
your
sake
Am
I
this
patient
logman
Do
you
love

bear
witness
to
this

And
crown
what
I
profess
with

If
I

If

to

Beyond

Do

you
I

To

what
I
am
glad
of
Aside
Fair
encounter
Of
two
most
rare
affections
Heavens
rain
grace
On
that
which
breeds
between

Wherefore
weep
you
At
mine
unworthiness
that
dare
not
offer
What
I
desire
to
give
and
much
less
take
What
I
shall
die
to
want
But
this
is
trifling
And
all
the
more
it
seeks
to
hide
itself
The
bigger
bulk
it
shows
Hence
bashful
cunning
And
prompt
me
plain
and
holy
innocence
I
am
your
wife
if
you
will
marry
me
If
not
Ill
die
your
maid
To
be
your
fellow
You
may
deny
me
but
Ill
be
your
servant
Whether
you
will
or
no
My
mistress
dearest
And
I
thus
humble
ever
My
husband
then
Ay
with
a
heart
as
willing
As

of

Heres
my
hand
And
mine
with
my

int
And
now
farewell
Till
half
an
hour
hence
thousand
thousand
So
glad
of
this
as
they
I
cannot
be
Who
are
surprisd
withal
but
my
rejoicing
At
nothing
can
be
more
Ill
to
my
book
For
yet
ere

time
must
I
perform
Much
business
appertaining
Byr
lakin
I
can
go
no
further
sir
My
old
bones
ache
Heres
a
maze
trod
indeed
Through
forthrights
and
meanders
By
your
patience
I
needs
must
rest
me
Old
lord
I
cannot
blame
thee
Who
am
myself
attachd
with
weariness
To
th
dulling
of
my
spirits
sit
down
and
rest
Even
here
I
will
put
off
my
hope
and
keep
it
No
longer
for
my
flatterer
he
is
drownd
Whom
thus
we
stray
to
find
and
the
sea
mocks
Our
frustrate
search
on
land
Well
let
him
go
Aside
to
I
am
right
glad
that
hes
so
out
of

Do
not
for

repulse
forgo
the
purpose
That

The

advantage
Will

Aside

Let
it

For
now

are
oppressd
with

Will
not

such
vigilance
As
when

Aside

I
say
tonight
no

Solemn
and
strange
music
and
on
the
top
invisible
Enter
several
strange
bringing
in
a
banquet
and
dance
about
it
with
gentle
actions
of
salutations
and
inviting
the
etc
to
eat
they
depart
What
harmony

My
good
friends
hark
Marvellous
sweet
music
Give

What

Now

That

There

one
phoenix
At

Ill

And

And
Ill
be
sworn

true
travellers
neer
did
lie
Though
fools
at
home
condemn
em
If
in
Naples
I
should
report
this
now
would
they
believe
me
If
I
should
say
I
saw
such
islanders
For
certes
these
are
people
of
the
island
Who
though
they
are
of
monstrous
shape
yet
note
Their
manners
are
more
gentlekind
than
of
Our
human
generation
you
shall
find
Many
nay
almost
any
Aside
Honest
lord
Thou
hast
said
well
for
some
of
you
there

Are
worse
than
devils
I
cannot
too
much
muse
Such
shapes
such

and
such

expressing
Although
they
want
the
use
of

a
kind
Of
excellent
dumb
discourse
Aside
Praise
in
departing
They
vanishd
strangely
No

They

Willt

Faith

you

When

Who

mountaineers
Dewlappd

hanging
at
em
Wallets
of
flesh
or
that
there
were
such
men
Whose
heads
stood
in
their
breasts
which
now
we
find
Each
putterout
of
five
for
one
will
bring
us
Good
warrant
of
I
will
stand
to
and
feed
Although
my
last
no
matter
since
I
feel
The
best
is
past
Brother
my
lord
the
Duke
Stand
to
and
do
as
we
Thunder
and
lightning
Enter
like
a
harpy
claps
his
wings
upon
the
table
and
with
a
quaint
device
the
banquet
vanishes
You
are
three
men
of
sin
whom
Destiny
That
hath
to
instrument
this
lower
world
And
what
is
int
the
neversurfeited
sea
Hath
causd
to
belch
up
you
and
on
this
island
Where
man
doth
not
inhabityou
mongst
men
Being
most
unfit
to
live
I
have
made
you
mad
And
even
with
suchlike
valour
men
hang
and
drown
Their
proper
selves
etc
draw
their
swords
You
fools
I
and
my
fellows
Are
ministers
of
Fate
the
elements
Of
whom
your
swords
are
temperd
may
as
well
Wound
the
loud
winds
or
with
bemockdat
stabs
Kill
the
stillclosing
waters
as
diminish
One
dowle
thats
in
my
plume
my
fellowministers
Are
like
invulnerable
If
you
could
hurt
Your
swords
are
now
too
massy
for
your
strengths
And
will
not
be
uplifted
But
remember
For
thats
my
business
to
youthat
you
three
From
Milan
did
supplant
good
Prospero
Exposd
unto
the
sea
which
hath
requit
it
Him
and
his
innocent
child
for
which
foul
deed
The
powrs
delaying
not
forgetting
have
Incensd
the
seas
and
shores
yea
all
the
creatures
Against
your
peace
Thee
of
thy
son
Alonso
They
have
bereft
and
do
pronounce
by
me
Lingring
perdition
worse
than
any
death
Can
be
at
once
shall
step
by
step
attend
You
and
your
ways
whose
wraths
to
guard
you
from
Which
here
in
this
most
desolate
isle
else
falls
Upon
your
headsis
nothing
but
hearts
sorrow
And
a
clear
life
ensuing
He
vanishes
in
thunder
then
to
soft
music
enter
the
again
and
dance
with
mocks
and
mows
and
carrying
out
the
table
Bravely
the
figure
of
this
harpy
hast
thou
Performd
my
Ariel
a
grace
it
had
devouring
Of
my
instruction
hast
thou
nothing
bated
In
what
thou
hadst
to
say
so
with
good
life
And
observation
strange
my
meaner
ministers
Their
several
kinds
have
done
My
high
charms
work
And
these
mine
enemies
are
all
knit
up
In
their
distractions
They
now
are
in
my
powr
And
in
these
fits
I
leave
them
while
I
visit
Young
Ferdinand
whom
they
suppose
is
drownd
And
his
and
mine
lovd
darling
I
th
name
of
something
holy
sir
why
stand
you
In
this
strange
stare
it
is
monstrous
monstrous
Methought
the
billows
spoke
and
told
me
of
it
The
winds
did
sing
it
to
me
and
the
thunder
That
deep
and
dreadful
organpipe
pronouncd
The
name
of
Prosper
it
did
bass
my
trespass
Therefore
my
son
i
th
ooze
is
bedded
and
Ill
seek
him
deeper
than
eer
plummet
sounded
And
with
him
there
lie
mudded
But
one
fiend
at
a
time
Ill
fight
their
legions
oer
Ill
be
thy
second
All
three
of
them
are
desperate
their
great
guilt
Like
poison
given
to
work
a
great
time
after
Now
gins
to
bite
the
spirits
I
do
beseech
you
That
are
of
suppler
joints
follow
them
swiftly
And
hinder
them
from
what
this
ecstasy
May
now
provoke
them
to
Follow
I
pray
you
Before
cell
Enter
and
If
I
have
too
austerely
punishd
you
Your
compensation
makes
amends
for
Have
given
you
here
a
third
of
mine
own
life
Or
that
for
which
I
live
who
once
again
I
tender
to
thy
hand
All
thy
vexations
Were
but
my
trials
of
thy
love
and
thou
Hast
strangely
stood
the
test
here
afore
heaven
I
ratify
this
my
rich
gift
Ferdinand
Do
not
smile
at
me
that
I
boast
her
off
For
thou
shalt
find
she
will
outstrip
all
praise
And
make
it
halt
behind
her
I
do
believe
it
Against
an
oracle
Then
as
my
gift
and
thine
own
acquisition
Worthily
purchasd
take
my
daughter
But
If
thou
dost
break
her
virginknot
before
All
sanctimonious
ceremonies
may
With
full
and
holy
rite
be
ministred
No
sweet
aspersion
shall
the
heavens
let
fall
To
make
this
contract
grow
but
barren
hate
Soureyd
disdain
and
discord
shall
bestrew
The
union
of
your
bed
with
weeds
so
loathly
That
you
shall
hate
it
both
Therefore
take
heed
As
Hymens
lamps
shall
light
you
As
I
hope
For
quiet
days
fair
issue
and
long
life
With
such
love
as
tis
now
the
murkiest
den
The
most
opportune
place
the
strongst
suggestion
Our
worser
genius
can
shall
never
melt
Mine
honour
into
lust
to
take
away
The
edge
of
that
days
celebration
When
I
shall
think
or
Phoebus
steeds
are
founderd
Or
Night
kept
chaind
below
Fairly
spoke
Sit
then
and
talk
with
her
she
is
thine
own
What
Ariel
my
industrious
servant
Ariel
Enter
What
would
my
potent
master
Here
I
am
Thou
and
thy
meaner
fellows
your
last
service
Did
worthily
perform
and
I
must
use
you
In
such
another
trick
Go
bring
the
rabble
Oer
whom
I
give
thee
powr
here
to
this
place
Incite
them
to
quick
motion
for
I
must
Bestow
upon
the
eyes
of
this
young
couple
Some
vanity
of
mine
art
it
is
my
promise
And
they
expect
it
from
me
Presently
Ay
with
a
twink
Before
you
can
say
come
and
go
And
breathe
twice
and
cry
so
so
Each
one
tripping
on
his
toe
Will
be
here
with
mop
and
mow
Do
you
love
me
master
No
Dearly
my
delicate
Ariel
Do
not
approach
Till
thou
dost
hear
me
call
Well
I
conceive
Look
thou
be
true
do
not
give
dalliance
Too
much
the
rein
the
strongest
oaths
are
straw
To
th
fire
i
th
blood
Be
more
abstemious
Or
else
good
night
your
vow
I
warrant
you
sir
The
white
cold
virgin
snow
upon
my
heart
Abates
the
ardour
of
my
liver
Well
Now

Let

green
land
Answer
your
summons
Juno
does
command
Come
temperate
nymphs
and
help
to
celebrate
contract
of
true
love
be
not
too
late
Enter
certain
You
sunburnt
sicklemen
of
August
weary
Come
hither
from
the
furrow
and
be
merry
Make
holiday
your
ryestraw
hats
put
on
And
these
fresh
nymphs
encounter
every
one
In
country
footing
Enter
certain
properly
habited
they
join
with
the
in
a
graceful
dance
towards
the
end
whereof
starts
suddenly
and
speaks
after
which
to
a
strange
hollow
and
confused
noise
they
heavily
vanish
Aside
I
had
forgot
that
foul
conspiracy
Of
the
beast
Caliban
and
his
confederates
Against
my
life
the
minute
of
their
plot
Is
almost
come
To
the
Well
done
avoid
no
more
This
is
strange
your
fathers
in
some
passion
That
works
him
strongly
Never
till
this
day
Saw
I
him
touchd
with
anger
so
distemperd
You
do
look
my
son
in
a
movd
sort
As
if
you
were
dismayd
be
cheerful
sir
Our
revels
now
are
ended
These
our
actors
As
I
foretold
you
were
all
spirits
and
Are
melted
into
air
into
thin
air
And
like
the
baseless
fabric
of
this
vision
The
cloudcappd
towers
the
gorgeous
palaces
The
solemn
temples
the
great
globe
itself
Yea
all
which
it
inherit
shall
dissolve
And
like
this
insubstantial
pageant
faded
Leave
not
a
rack
behind
We
are
such
stuff
As
dreams
are
made
on
and
our
little
life
Is
rounded
with
a
sleep
Sir
I
am
vexd
Bear
with
my
weakness
my
old
brain
is
troubled
Be
not
disturbd
with
my
infirmity
If
you
be
pleasd
retire
into
my
cell
And
there
repose
a
turn
or
two
Ill
walk
To
still
my
beating
mind
We
wish
your
peace
Come
with
a
thought
I
thank
thee
Ariel
come
Enter
Thy
thoughts
I
cleave
to
Whats
thy
pleasure
Spirit
We
must
prepare
to
meet
with
Caliban
Ay
my
commander
When
I
presented
Ceres
I
thought
to
have
told
thee
of
it
but
I
feard
Lest
I
might
anger
thee
Say
again
where
didst
thou
leave
these
varlets
I
told
you
sir
they
were
redhot
with
drinking
So
full
of
valour
that
they
smote
the
air
For
breathing
in
their
faces
beat
the
ground
For
kissing
of
their
feet
yet
always
bending
Towards
their
project
Then
I
beat
my
tabor
At
which
like
unbackd
colts
they
prickd
their
ears
Advancd
their
eyelids
lifted
up
their
noses
As
they
smelt
music
so
I
charmd
their
cars
That
calflike
they
my
lowing
followd
through
Toothd
briers
sharp
furzes
pricking
goss
and
thorns
Which
entred
their
frail
shins
At
last
I
left
them
I
th
filthy
mantled
pool
beyond
your
cell
There
dancing
up
to
th
chins
that
the
foul
lake
Oerstunk
their
feet
This
was
well
done
my
bird
Thy
shape
invisible
retain
thou
still
The
trumpery
in
my
house
go
bring
it
hither
For
stale
to
catch
these
thieves
I
go
I
go
devil
a
born
devil
on
whose
nature
Nurture
can
never
stick
on
whom
my
pains
Humanely
taken
all
all
lost
quite
lost
And
as
with
age
his
body
uglier
grows
So
his
mind
cankers
I
will
plague
them
all
Even
to
roaring
Reenter
loaden
with
glistering
apparel
c
Come
hang
them
on
this
line
and
remain
invisible
Enter
and
all
wet
Pray

tread
softly
that
the
blind
mole
may
not
Hear
a
foot
fall
we
now
are
near
his
cell
Monster
your
fairy
which
you
say

a
harmless
fairy

Jack
with
us
Monster

do
smell
all
horsepiss

my
nose
is
in
great
indignation
So

this
mischance

Alls

Ay

our
bottles

pool
There
is
not
only
disgrace
and
dishonour
in
that
monster
but
an
infinite
loss
Thats
more
to
me
than
my
wetting

is
your
harmless
fairy

labours
end
and
thou
Shalt
have
the
air
at
freedom
for
a
little
Follow
and
do
me
service
Before
cell
Enter
in
his
magic
robes
and
Now
does
my
project
gather
to
a
head
My
charms
crack
not
my
spirits
obey
and
time
Goes
upright
with
his
carriage
Hows
the
day
On
the
sixth
hour
at
which
time
my
lord
You
said
our
work
should
cease
I
did
say
so
When
first
I
raisd
the
tempest
Say
my
spirit
How
fares
the
King
and
s
followers
Confind
together
In
the
same
fashion
as
you
gave
in
charge
Just
as
you
left
them
all
prisoners
sir
In
the
linegrove
which
weatherfends
your
cell
They
cannot
budge
till
your
release
The
King
His
brother
and
yours
abide
all
three
distracted
And
the
remainder
mourning
over
them
Brim
full
of
sorrow
and
dismay
but
chiefly
Him
you
termd
sir
the
good
old
lord
Gonzalo
His
tears
run
down
his
beard
like
winters
drops
From
eaves
of
reeds
Your
charm
so
strongly
works
em
That
if
you
now
beheld
them
your
affections
Would
become
tender
Dost
thou
think
so
spirit
Mine
would
sir
were
I
human
And
mine
shall
Hast
thou
which
art
but
air
a
touch
a
feeling
Of
their
afflictions
and
shall
not
myself
One
of
their
kind
that
relish
all
as
sharply
Passion
as
they
be
kindlier
movd
than
thou
art
Though
with
their
high
wrongs
I
am
struck
to
th
quick
Yet
with
my
nobler
reason
gainst
my
fury
Do
I
take
part
the
rarer
action
is
In
virtue
than
in
vengeance
they
being
penitent
The
sole
drift
of
my
purpose
doth
extend
Not
a
frown
further
Go
release
them
Ariel
My
charms
Ill
break
their
senses
Ill
restore
And
they
shall
be
themselves
Ill
fetch
them
sir
Ye
elves
of
hills
brooks
standing
lakes
and
groves
And
ye
that
on
the
sands
with
printless
foot
Do
chase
the
ebbing
Neptune
and
do
fly
him
When
he
comes
back
you
demipuppets
that
By
moonshine
do
the
green
sour
ringlets
make
Whereof
the
ewe
not
bites
and
you
whose
pastime
Is
to
make
midnight
mushrooms
that
rejoice
To
hear
the
solemn
curfew
by
whose
aid
Weak
masters
though
ye
beI
have
bedimmd
The
noontide
sun
calld
forth
the
mutinous
winds
And
twixt
the
green
sea
and
the
azurd
vault
Set
roaring
war
To
the
dread
rattling
thunder
Have
I
given
fire
and
rifted
Joves
stout
oak
With
his
own
bolt
the
strongbasd
promontory
Have
I
made
shake
and
by
the
spurs
pluckd
up
The
pine
and
cedar
Graves
at
my
command
Have
wakd
their
sleepers
opd
and
let
em
forth
By
my
so
potent
art
But
this
rough
magic
I
here
abjure
and
when
I
have
requird
Some
heavenly
musicwhich
even
now
I
do
To
work
mine
end
upon
their
senses
that
This
airy
charm
is
for
Ill
break
my
staff
Bury
it
certain
fathoms
in
the
earth
And
deeper
than
did
ever
plummet
sound
Ill
drown
my
book
Solem
music
Here
enters
before
then
with
frantic
gesture
attended
by
and
in
like
manner
attended
by
and
They
all
enter
the
circle
which
had
made
and
there
stand
charmd
which
observing
speaks
solemn
air
and
the
best
comforter
To
an
unsettled
fancy
cure
thy
brains
Now
useless
boild
within
thy
skull
There
stand
For
you
are
spellstoppd
Holy
Gonzalo
honourable
man
Mine
eyes
evn
sociable
to
the
show
of
thine
Fall
fellowly
drops
The
charm
dissolves
apace
And
as
the
morning
steals
upon
the
night
Melting
the
darkness
so
their
rising
senses
Begin
to
chase
the
ignorant
fumes
that
mantle
Their
clearer
reason
good
Gonzalo
My
true
preserver
and
a
loyal
sir
To
him
thou
followst
I
will
pay
thy
graces
Home
both
in
word
and
deed
Most
cruelly
Didst
thou
Alonso
use
me
and
my
daughter
Thy
brother
was
a
furtherer
in
the
act
Thou
art
pinchd
fort
now
Sebastian
Flesh
and
blood
You
brother
mine
that
entertaind
ambition
Expelld
remorse
and
nature
who
with
Sebastian
Whose
inward
pinches
therefore
are
most
strong
Would
here
have
killd
your
king
I
do
forgive
thee
Unnatural
though
thou
art
Their
understanding
Begins
to
swell
and
the
approaching
tide
Will
shortly
fill
the
reasonable
shore
That
now
lies
foul
and
muddy
Not
one
of
them
That
yet
looks
on
me
or
would
know
me
Ariel
Fetch
me

hat
and
rapier
in
my

I
will

and

Where
the

there

I
In
a

bell
I
lie
There
I
couch
when
owls
do
cry
On
the
bats
back
I
do
fly
After
summer
merrily
Merrily
merrily
shall
I
live
now
Under
the
blossom
that
hangs
on
the
bough
Why
thats
my
dainty
Ariel
I
shall
miss
thee
But
yet
thou
shalt
have
freedom
So
so
so
To
the
Kings
ship
invisible
as
thou
art
There
shalt
thou
find
the
mariners
asleep
Under
the
hatches
the
master
and
the
boatswain
Being
awake
enforce
them
to
this
place
And
presently
I
prithee
I
drink
the
air
before
me
and
return
Or
ere
your
pulse
twice
beat
All
torment
trouble
wonder
and
amazement
Inhabits
here
Some
heavenly
power
guide
us
Out
of
this
fearful
country
Behold
Sir
King
The
wronged
Duke
of
Milan
Prospero
For
more
assurance
that
a
living
prince
Does
now
speak
to
thee
I
embrace
thy
body
And
to
thee
and
thy
company
I
bid
hearty
welcome
Wheer
thou
best
he
or
no
Or
some
enchanted
trifle
to
abuse
me
As
late
I
have
been
I
not
know
Thy
pulse
Beats
as
of
flesh
and
blood
and
since
I
saw
thee
Th
affliction
of
my
mind
amends
with
which
I
fear
a
madness
held
me
This
must
crave
An
if
this
be
at
alla
most
strange
story
Thy
dukedom
I
resign
and
do
entreat
Thou
pardon
me
my
wrongs
But
how
should
Prospero
Be
living
and
be
here
First
noble
friend
Let
me
embrace
thine
age
whose
honour
cannot
Be
measurd
or
confind
Whether
this
be
Or
be
not
Ill
not
swear
You
do
yet
taste
Some
subtleties
o
th
isle
that
will
not
let
you
Believe
things
certain
Welcome
my
friends
all
Aside
to
and
But
you
my
brace
of
lords
were
I
so
minded
I
here
could
pluck
his
Highness
frown
upon
you
And
justify
you
traitors
at
this
time
I
will
tell
no
tales
Aside
The
devil
speaks
in
him
No
For
you
most
wicked
sir
whom
to
call
brother
Would
even
infect
my
mouth
I
do
forgive
Thy
rankest
faultall
of
them
and
require
My
dukedom
of
thee
which
perforce
I
know
Thou
must
restore
If
thou
beest
Prospero
Give
us
particulars
of
thy
preservation
How
thou
hast
met
us
here
whom
three
hours
since
Were
wreckd
upon
this
shore
where
I
have
lost
How
sharp
the
point
of
this
remembrance
is
My
dear
son
Ferdinand
I
am
woe
fort
sir
Irreparable
is
the
loss
and
patience
Says
it
is
past
her
cure
I
rather
think
You
have
not
sought
her
help
of
whose
soft
grace
For
the
like
loss
I
have
her
sovereign
aid
And
rest
myself
content
You
the
like
loss
As
great
to
me
as
late
and
supportable
To
make
the
dear
loss
have
I
means
much
weaker
Than
you
may
call
to
comfort
you
for
I
Have
lost
my
daughter
daughter
heavens
that
they
were
living
both
in
Naples
The
King
and
Queen
there
That
they
were
I
wish
Myself
were
mudded
in
that
oozy
bed
Where
my
son
lies
When
did
you
lose
your
daughter
In
this
last
tempest
I
perceive
these
lords
At
this
encounter
do
so
much
admire
That
they
devour
their
reason
and
scarce
think
Their
eyes
do
offices
of
truth
their
words
Are
natural
breath
but
howsoeer
you
have
Been
justled
from
your
senses
know
for
certain
That
I
am
Prospero
and
that
very
duke
Which
was
thrust
forth
of
Milan
who
most
strangely
Upon
this
shore
where
you
were
wrecked
was
landed
To
be
the
lord
ont
No
more
yet
of
this
For
tis
a
chronicle
of
day
by
day
Not
a
relation
for
a
breakfast
nor
Befitting
this
first
meeting
Welcome

This
cells
my
court
here

I
few
attendants
And
subjects
none
abroad

look
in
My
dukedom
since
you
have
given
me
again
I
will
requite
you
with
as
good
a
thing
At
least
bring
forth
a
wonder
to
content
ye
As
much
as
me
my
dukedom
Here
discovers
and
playing
at
chess
Sweet
lord
you
play
me
false
No
my
dearest
love
I
would
not
for
the
world
Yes
for
a
score
of
kingdoms
you
should
wrangle
And
I
would
call
it
fair
play
If
this
prove
vision
of
the
island
one
dear
son
Shall
I
twice
lose
most
high
miracle
Though
the
seas
threaten
they
are
merciful
I
have
cursd
them
without
cause
Kneels
Now
all
the
blessings
Of
a
glad
father
compass
thee
about
Arise
and
say
how
thou
camst
here
wonder
How
many
goodly
creatures
are
there
here
How
beauteous
mankind
is
brave
new
world
That
has
such
people
int
Tis
new
to
thee
What
is
this
maid
with
whom
thou
wast
at
play
Your
eldst
acquaintance
cannot
be
three
hours
Is
she
the
goddess
that
hath
severd
us
And
brought
us
thus
together
Sir
she
is
mortal
But
by
immortal
Providence
shes
mine
I
chose
her
when
I
could
not
ask
my
father
For
his
advice
nor
thought
I
had
one
She
Is
daughter
to
this
famous
Duke
of
Milan
Of
whom
so
often
I
have
heard
renown
But
never
saw
before
of
whom
I
have
Receivd
a
second
life
and
second
father
This
lady
makes
him
to
me
I
am
hers
But
how
oddly
will
it
sound
that
I
Must
ask
my
child
forgiveness
There
sir
stop
Let
us
not
burden
our
remembrances
with
heaviness
thats
gone
I
have
inly
wept
Or
should
have
spoke
ere
this
Look
down
you
gods
And
on
this
couple
drop
a
blessed
crown
For
it
is
you
that
have
chalkd
forth
the
way
Which
brought
us
hither
I
say
Amen
Gonzalo
Was
Milan
thrust
from
Milan
that
his
issue
Should
become
Kings
of
Naples
rejoice
Beyond
a
common
joy
and
set
it
down
With
gold
on
lasting
pillars
in
one
voyage
Did
Claribel
her
husband
find
at
Tunis
And
Ferdinand
her
brother
found
a
wife
Where
he
himself
was
lost
Prospero
his
dukedom
In
a
poor
isle
and
all
of
us
ourselves
When
no
man
was
his
own
To
and
Give
me
your
hands
Let
grief
and
sorrow
still
embrace
his
heart
That
doth
not
wish
you
joy
Be
it
so
Amen
Reenter
with
the
and
amazedly
following
look
sir
look
sir
Here
is
more
of
us
I
prophesied
if
a
gallows
were
on
land
This
fellow
could
not
drown
Now
blasphemy
That
swearst
grace
oerboard
not
an
oath
on
shore
Hast
thou
no
mouth
by
land
What
is
the
news
The
best
news
is
that
we
have
safely
found
Our
King
and
company
the
next
our
ship
Which
but
three
glasses
since
we
gave
out
split
Is
tight
and
yare
and
bravely
riggd
as
when
We
first
put
out
to
sea
Aside
to
Sir
all
this
service
Have
I
done
since
I
went
Aside
to
My
tricksy
spirit
These
are
not
natural
events
they
strengthen
From
strange
to
stranger
Say
how
came
you
hither
If
I
did
think
sir
I
were
well
awake
Id
strive
to
tell
you
We
were
dead
of
sleep
Andhow
we
know
notall
clappd
under
hatches
Where
but
even
now
with
strange
and
several
noises
Of
roaring
shrieking
howling
jingling
chains
And
moe
diversity
of
sounds
all
horrible
We
were
awakd
straightway
at
liberty
Where
we
in
all
her
trim
freshly
beheld
Our
royal
good
and
gallant
ship
our
master
Capring
to
eye
her
On
a
trice
so
please

Even
in
a
dream
were
we
divided
from
them
And
were
brought
moping
hither
Aside
to
Wast
well
done
Aside
to
Bravely
my
diligence
Thou
shalt
be
free
This
is
as
strange
a
maze
as
eer
men
trod
And
there
is
in
this
business
more
than
nature
Was
ever
conduct
of
Some
oracle
Must
rectify
our
knowledge
Sir
my
liege
Do
not
infest
your
mind
with
beating
on
The
strangeness
of
this
business
at
pickd
leisure
Which
shall
be
shortly
single
Ill
resolve
you
Which
to
you
shall
seem
probable
of

And

Aside

Untie

spell
There
are
yet
missing
of
your
company
Some
few
odd
lads
that
you
remember
not
Reenter
driving
in
and
in
their
stolen
apparel
Every
man
shift
for
all
the
rest
and

take
care
for
himself
for

Coragio

If

How

chastise
me
Ha

What
things

my
lord
Antonio
Will

Very
like
one
of

Is
a
plain
fish
and
no
doubt
marketable
Mark
but
the
badges
of
these
men
my
lords
Then
say
if
they
be
true
This
misshapen
knave
His
mother
was
a
witch
and
one
so
strong
That
could
control
the
moon
make
flows
and
ebbs
And
deal
in
her
command
without
her
power
These
three
have
robbd

For

To

Acknowledge

drunken
butler
He

And
Trinculo

Find

grand
liquor

have
been
in
such
a
pickle
since
I
saw

of
my
bones
I
shall
not
fear
flyblowing
Why

a
cramp
Youd

king
o
the
isle
sirrah
I
should
have
been
a
sore
one
then
Pointing
to
This
is
as
strange
a
thing
as
eer

as
disproportioned
in
his
manners
As
in
his
shape
Go

companions
as

To

handsomely
Ay

I
will
and
Ill
be
wise
hereafter
And
seek
for
grace
What
a
thricedouble
ass
Was
I
to
take
this
drunkard
for
a
god
And
worship
this
dull
fool
Go

Hence

your
luggage
where

Or

train
To
my
poor
cell
where
you
shall
take
your
rest
For
this
one
night
which
part
of
it
Ill
waste
With
such
discourse
as
I
not
doubt
shall
make
it
Go
quick
awaythe
story
of
my
life
And
the
particular
accidents
gone
by
Since
I
came
to
this
isle
And
in
the
morn
Ill
bring
you
to
your
ship
and
so
to
Naples
Where
I
have
hope
to
see
the
nuptial
Of
these
our
dearbelovd

And
thence

Milan

haves
mine
own
Which
is
most
faint
Now
tis
true
I
must
be
here
confind
by
you
Or
sent
to
Naples
Let
me
not
Since
I
have
my
dukedom
got
And
pardond
the
deceiver
dwell
In
this
bare
island
by
your
spell
But
release
me
from
my
bands
With
the
help
of
your
good
hands
Gentle
breath
of
yours
my
sails
Must
fill
or
else
my
project
fails
Which
was
to
please
Now
I
want
Spirits
to
enforce
art
to
enchant
And
my
ending
is
despair
Unless
I
be
relievd
by
prayer
Which
pierces
so
that
it
assaults
Mercy
itself
and
frees
all
faults
As
you
from
crimes
would
pardond
be
Let
your
indulgence
set
me
free
I
I
Athens
house
Enter
and
at
several
doors
Good
day
sir
I
am
glad
yare
well
I
have
not
seen
you
long
how
goes
the
world
It
wears
sir
as
it
grows
Ay
thats
well
known
But
what
particular
rarity
What
strange
Which
manifold
record
not
matches
See
Magic
of
bounty
all
these
spirits
thy
power
Hath
conjurd
to
attend
I
know
the
merchant
I
know
them
both
th
others
a
jeweller
tis
a
worthy
lord
Nay
thats
most
fixd
most
incomparable
man
breathd
as
it
were
To
an
untirable
and
continuate
goodness
He
passes
I
have
a
jewel
here
pray
lets
seet
For
the
Lord
Timon
sir
If
he
will
touch
the
estimate
But
for
that
When
we
for
recompense
have
praisd
the
vile
It
stains
the
glory
in
that
happy
verse
Which
aptly
sings
the
good
Looking
at
the
jewel
Tis
a
good
form
And
rich
Here
is
a
water
look
ye
You
are
rapt
sir
in
some
work
some
dedication
To
the
great
lord
thing
slippd
idly
from
me
Our
poesy
is
as
a
gum
which
oozes
From
whence
tis
nourishd
The
fire
i
th
flint
Shows
not
till
it
be
struck
our
gentle
flame
Provokes
itself
and
like
the
current
flies
Each
bound
it
chafes
What
have
you
there
picture
sir
When
comes
your
book
forth
Upon
the
heels
of
my
presentment
sir
Lets
see
your
piece
Tis
a
good
piece
So
tis
this
comes
off
well
and
excellent
Indifferent
Admirable
How
this
grace
Speaks
his
own
standing
What
a
mental
power
This
eye
shoots
forth
How
big
imagination
Moves
in
this
lip
To
th
dumbness
of
the
gesture
One
might
interpret
It
is
a
pretty
mocking
of
the
life
Here
is
a
touch
ist
good
I
will
say
of
it
It
tutors
nature
Artificial
strife
Lives
in
these
touches
livelier
than
life
Enter
certain
and
pass
over
How
this
lord
is
followed
The
senators
of
Athens
happy
man
Look
moe
You
see
this
confluence
this
great
flood
of
visitors
I
have
in
this
rough
work
shapd
out
a
man
Whom
this
beneath
world
doth
embrace
and
hug
With
amplest
entertainment
My
free
drift
Halts
not
particularly
but
moves
itself
In
a
wide
sea
of
tax
No
levelld
malice
Infects
one
comma
in
the
course
I
hold
But
flies
an
eagle
flight
bold
and
forth
on
Leaving
no
tract
behind
How
shall
I
understand
you
I
will
unbolt
to
you
You
see
how
all
conditions
how
all
minds
As
well
of
glib
and
slippry
creatures
as
Of
grave
and
austere
quality
tender
down
Their
services
to
Lord
Timon
His
large
fortune
Upon
his
good
and
gracious
nature
hanging
Subdues
and
properties
to
his
love
and
tendance
All
sorts
of
hearts
yea
from
the
glassfacd
flatterer
To
Apemantus
that
few
things
loves
better
Than
to
abhor
himself
even
he
drops
down
The
knee
before
him
and
returns
in
peace
Most
rich
in
Timons
nod
I
saw
them
speak
together
Sir
I
have
upon
a
high
and
pleasant
hill
Feignd
Fortune
to
be
thrond
The
base
o
th
mount
Is
rankd
with
all
deserts
all
kind
of
natures
That
labour
on
the
bosom
of
this
sphere
To
propagate
their
states
Amongst
them
all
Whose
eyes
are
on
this
sovereign
lady
fixd
One
do
I
personate
of
Lord
Timons
frame
Whom
Fortune
with
her
ivory
hand
wafts
to
her
Whose
present
grace
to
present
slaves
and
servants
Translates
his
rivals
Tis
conceivd
to
scope
This
throne
this
Fortune
and
this
hill
methinks
With
one
man
beckond
from
the
rest
below
Bowing
his
head
against
the
steepy
mount
To
climb
his
happiness
would
be
well
expressd
In
our
condition
Nay
sir
but
hear
me
on
All
those
which
were
his
fellows
but
of
late
Some
better
than
his
value
on
the
moment
Follow
his
strides
his
lobbies
fill
with
tendance
Rain
sacrificial
whisperings
in
his
ear
Make
sacred
even
his
stirrup
and
through
him
Drink
the
free
air
Ay
marry
what
of
these
When
Fortune
in
her
shift
and
change
of
mood
Spurns
down
her
late
beloved
all
his
dependants
Which
labourd
after
him
to
the
mountains
top
Even
on
their
knees
and
hands
let
him
slip
down
Not
one
accompanying
his
declining
foot
Tis
common
thousand
moral
paintings
I
can
show
That
shall
demonstrate
these
quick
blows
of
Fortunes
More
pregnantly
than
words
Yet
you
do
well
To
show
Lord
Timon
that
mean
eyes
have
seen
The
foot
above
the
head
Trumpets
sound
Enter
addressing
himself
courteously
to
every
suitor
a
from
talking
with
him
and
other
servants
following
Imprisond
is
he
say
you
Ay
my
good
lord
Five
talents
is
his
debt
His
means
most
short
his
creditors
most
strait
Your
honourable
letter
he
desires
To
those
have
shut
him
up
which
failing
Periods
his
comfort
Noble
Ventidius
Well
I
am
not
of
that
feather
to
shake
of
My
friend
when
he
must
need
me
I
do
know
him
gentleman
that
well
deserves
a
help
Which
he
shall
have
Ill
pay
the
debt
and
free
him
Your
lordship
ever
binds
him
Commend
me
to
him
I
will
send
his
ransom
And
being
enfranchisd
bid
him
come
to
me
Tis
not
enough
to
help
the
feeble
up
But
to
support
him
after
Fare
you
well
All
happiness
to
your
honour
Enter
an
Lord
Timon
hear
me
speak
Freely
good
father
Thou
hast
a
servant
namd
Lucilius
I
have
so
what
of

Most
noble

Attends

Lucilius
Here

your
lordships
service
This
fellow
here
Lord
Timon
this
thy
creature
By
night
frequents
my
house
I
am
a
man
That
from
my
first
have
been
inclind
to
thrift
And
my
estate
deserves
an
heir
more
raisd
Than
one
which
holds
a
trencher
Well
what
further
One
only
daughter
have
I
no
kin
else
On
whom
I
may
confer
what
I
have
got
The
maid
is
fair
o
th
youngest
for
a
bride
And
I
have
bred
her
at
my
dearest
cost
In
qualities
of
the
best
This
man
of
thine
Attempts
her
love
I
prithee
noble
lord
Join
with
me
to
forbid
him
her
resort
Myself
have
spoke
in
vain
The
man
is
honest
Therefore
he
will
be
Timon
His
honesty
rewards
him
in
itself
It
must
not
bear
my
daughter
Does
she
love
him
She
is
young
and
apt
Our
own
precedent
passions
do
instruct
us
What
levitys
in
youth
Love
you
the
maid
Ay
my
good
lord
and
she
accepts
of
it
If
in
her
marriage
my
consent
be
missing
I
call
the
gods
to
witness
I
will
choose
Mine
heir
from
forth
the
beggars
of
the
world
And
dispossess
her
all
How
shall
she
be
endowd
If
she
be
mated
with
an
equal
husband
Three
talents
on
the
present
in
future
all
This
gentleman
of
mine
hath
servd
me
long
To
build
his
fortune
I
will
strain
a
little
For
tis
a
bond
in
men
Give

thy
daughter
What

bestow
in
him
Ill

And
make
him
weigh
with
her
Most

Painting

For

Sir
your
jewel
Hath
suffered
under

What

lord
Dispraise

satiety
of
commendations
If
I

pay
you
fort
as
tis
extolld
It
would
unclew
me
quite
My
lord
tis
rated
As
those
which
sell
would
give
but
you
well
know
Things
of
like
value
differing
in
the
owners
Are
prized
by
their
masters
Believet
dear
lord
You
mend
the
jewel
by
the
wearing
it
Well
mockd
Enter
No
my
good
lord

Which

Look

Well

Good

When

Why

them
knaves
Thou

Are

not
Athenians
Yes
Then
I
repent
not
You
know
me
Apemantus
Thou

I
calld
thee
by
thy
name
Thou

proud
Apemantus
Of

so
much
as
that
I
am
not
like
Timon
Whither
art
going
To
knock
out
an
honest
Athenians
brains
Thats
a
deed
thout
die
for
Right
if
doing
nothing

death
by
th
law
How
likst
thou
this
picture
Apemantus
The
best
for
the
innocence
Wrought
he
not
well
that
painted
it
He
wrought
better
that
made
the
painter
and
yet
hes
but
a
filthy
piece
of
work
Yare

Thy
mothers
of
my
generation
whats

if
I
be
a
dog
Wilt
dine

Apemantus
No
I

lords
An
thou
shouldst
thoudst
anger
ladies
they
eat
lords
so
they
come
by
great
bellies
Thats
a
lascivious
apprehension
So
thou
apprehendst
it
take
it
for
thy
labour
How
dost
thou
like
this
jewel
Apemantus
Not
so
well
as
plain
dealing
which
will
not
cost
a
man
a
doit
What
dost
thou
think
tis
worth
Not
worth
my
thinking
How
now
poet
How
now
philosopher
Thou
liest
Art
not
one
Yes
Then
I
lie
not
Art
not
a
poet
Yes
Then
thou
liest
Look
in
thy
last
work
where
thou
hast
feignd
him
a
worthy
fellow
Thats
not
feignd
he
is
so
Yes
he
is
worthy
of
thee
and
to
pay
thee
for
thy
labour
He
that
loves
to
be
flattered
is
worthy
o
th
flatterer
Heavens
that
I
were
a
lord
What
wouldst
do
then
Apemantus
Een
as
Apemantus
does
now
hate
a
lord
with
my
heart
What
thyself
Ay
Wherefore
That
I
had
no
angry
wit
to
be
a
lord
Art
not
thou
a
merchant
Ay
Apemantus
Traffic
confound
thee
if
the

If

Into

Hang

heart
of

repays
Sevenfold
above

But

a
return
exceeding
All

of

The

Long
may
he
live

Nor

flow
of
riot
takes
no
account
How

from

Of

Never

Was

unwise
to

What

yourselves
Speak

em
fool
How
do
you
gentlemen
Gramercies
good
fool
How
does
your
mistress
Shes
een
setting
on
water
to
scald
such
chickens
as
you
are
Would
we
could
see
you
at
Corinth
Good
gramercy
Enter
Look

here

To
the
Why
how
now
Captain
What
do
you
in
this
wise
company
How
dost
thou
Apemantus
Would
I
had
a
rod
in
my
mouth
that
I
might
answer
thee
profitably
Prithee
Apemantus
read
me
the
superscription
of
these
letters
I
know
not
which
is
which
Canst
not
read
No
There
will
little
learning
die
then
that
day
thou
art
hangd
This
is
to
Lord
Timon
this
to
Alcibiades
Go
thou
wast
born
a
bastard
and
thout
die
a
bawd
Thou
wast
whelpd
a
dog
and
thou
shalt
famish
dogs
death
Answer
not
I
am
gone
Een
so
thou
outrunst
grace
Fool
I
will
go
with
you
to
Lord
Timons
Will
you
leave
me
there
If
Timon
stay
at
home
You
three
serve
three
usurers
Ay
would
they
servd
us
So
would
I
as
good
a
trick
as
ever
hangman
servd
thief
Are
you
three
usurers
men
Ay
fool
I
think
no
usurer
but
has
a
fool
to
his
servant
My
mistress
is
one
and
I
am
her
fool
When
men
come
to
borrow
of
your
masters
they
approach
sadly
and
go
away
merry
but
they
enter
my
mistress
house
merrily
and
go
away
sadly
The
reason
of
this
I
could
render
one
Do
it
then
that
we
may
account
thee
a
whoremaster
and
a
knave
which
notwithstanding
thou
shalt
be
no
less
esteemed
What
is
a
whoremaster
fool
fool
in
good
clothes
and
something
like
thee
Tis
a
spirit
Sometime
t
appears
like
a
lord
sometime
like
a
lawyer
sometime
like
a
philosopher
with
two
stones
moe
thans
artificial
one
He
is
very
often
like
a
knight
and
generally
in
all
shapes
that
man
goes
up
and
down
in
from
fourscore
to
thirteen
this
spirit
walks
in
Thou
art
not
altogether
a
fool
Nor
thou
altogether
a
wise
man
As
much
foolery
as
I
have
so
much
wit
thou
lackst
That
answer
might
have
become
Apemantus
Aside
aside
here
comes
Lord
Timon
Reenter
and
Come
with
me
fool
come
I
do
not
always
follow
lover
elder
brother
and
woman
sometime
the
philosopher
Pray
you
walk
near
Ill
speak
with
you
anon
You
make
me
marvel
wherefore
ere
this
time
Had
you
not
fully
laid
my
state
before
me
That
I
might
so
have
rated
my
expense
As
I
had
leave
of
means
You
would
not
hear
me
At
many
leisures
I
proposd
Go
to
Perchance
some
single
vantages
you
took
When
my
indisposition
put
you
back
And
that
unaptness
made
your
minister
Thus
to
excuse
yourself
my
good
lord
At
many
times
I
brought
in
my
accounts
Laid
them
before
you
you
would
throw
them
off
And
say
you
found
them
in
mine
honesty
When
for
some
trifling
present
you
have
bid
me
Return
so
much
I
have
shook
my
head
and
wept
Yea
gainst
th
authority
of
manners
prayd
you
To
hold
your
hand
more
close
I
did
endure
Not
seldom
nor
no
slight
checks
when
I
have
Prompted
you
in
the
ebb
of
your
estate
And
your
great
flow
of
debts
My
lovd
lord
Though
you
hear
now
too
late
yet
nows
a
time
The
greatest
of
your
having
lacks
a
half
To
pay
your
present
debts
Let
all
my
land
be
sold
Tis
all
engagd
some
forfeited
and
gone
And
what
remains
will
hardly
stop
the
mouth
Of
present
dues
The
future
comes
apace
What
shall
defend
the
interim
And
at
length
How
goes
our
reckning
To
Lacedaemon
did
my
land
extend
my
good
lord
the
world
is
but
a
word
Were
it
all
yours
to
give
it
in
a
breath
How
quickly
were
it
gone
You
tell
me
true
If
you
suspect
my
husbandry
or
falsehood
Call
me
before
th
exactest
auditors
And
set
me
on
the
proof
So
the
gods
bless
me
When
all
our
offices
have
been
oppressd
With
riotous
feeders
when
our
vaults
have
wept
With
drunken
spilth
of
wine
when
every
room
Hath
blazd
with
lights
and
brayd
with
minstrelsy
I
have
retird
me
to
a
wasteful
cock
And
set
mine
eyes
at
flow
Prithee
no
more
Heavens
have
I
said
the
bounty
of
this
lord
How
many
prodigal
bits
have
slaves
and
peasants
This
night
englutted
Who
is
not
Lord
Timons
What
heart
head
sword
force
means
but
is
Lord
Timons
Great
Timon
noble
worthy
royal
Timon
Ah
when
the
means
are
gone
that
buy
this
praise
The
breath
is
gone
whereof
this
praise
is
made
Feastwon
fastlost
one
cloud
of
winter
showrs
These
flies
are
couchd
Come
sermon
me
no
further
No
villainous
bounty
yet
hath
passd
my
heart
Unwisely
not
ignobly
have
I
given
Why
dost
thou
weep
Canst
thou
the
conscience
lack
To
think
I
shall
lack
friends
Secure
thy
heart
If
I
would
broach
the
vessels
of
my
love
And
try
the
argument
of
hearts
by
borrowing
Men
and
mens
fortunes
could
I
frankly
use
As
I
can
bid
thee
speak
Assurance
bless
your
thoughts
And
in
some
sort
these
wants
of
mine
are
crownd
That
I
account
them
blessings
for
by
these
Shall
I
try
friends
You
shall
perceive
how
you
Mistake
my
fortunes
I
am
wealthy
in
my
friends
Within
there
Flaminius
Servilius
Enter
and
another
My
lord
my
lord
I
will
dispatch
you
severally
you
to
Lord
Lucius
to
Lord
Lucullus
you
I
hunted
with
his
honour
today
You
to
Sempronius
Commend
me
to
their
loves
and
I
am
proud
say
that
my
occasions
have
found
time
to
use
em
toward
a
supply
of
money
Let
the
request
be
fifty
talents
As
you
have
said
my
lord
Aside
Lord
Lucius
and
Lucullus
Humh
Go
you
sir
to
the
senators
Of
whom
even
to
the
states
best
health
I
have
Deservd
this
hearing
Bid
em
send
o
th
instant
thousand
talents
to
me
I
have
been
bold
For
that
I
knew
it
the
most
general
way
To
them
to
use
your
signet
and
your
name
But
they
do
shake
their
heads
and
I
am
here
No
richer
in
return
Ist
true
Cant
be
They
answer
in
a
joint
and
corporate
voice
That
now
they
are
at
fall
want
treasure
cannot
Do
what
they
would
are
sorry
you
are
honourable
But
yet
they
could
have
wishd
they
know
not
Something
hath
been
amiss
a
noble
nature
May
catch
a
wrench
would
all
were
well
tis
pity
And
so
intending
other
serious
matters
After
distasteful
looks
and
these
hard
fractions
With
certain
halfcaps
and
coldmoving
nods
They
froze
me
into
silence
You
gods
reward
them
Prithee
man
look
cheerly
These
old
fellows
Have
their
ingratitude
in
them
hereditary
Their
blood
is
cakd
tis
cold
it
seldom
flows
Tis
lack
of
kindly
warmth
they
are
not
kind
And
nature
as
it
grows
again
toward
earth
Is
fashiond
for
the
journey
dull
and
heavy
Go
to
Ventidius
Prithee
be
not
sad
Thou
art
true
and
honest
ingeniously
I
speak
No
blame
belongs
to
thee
Ventidius
lately
Buried
his
father
by
whose
death
hes
steppd
Into
a
great
estate
When
he
was
poor
Imprisond
and
in
scarcity
of
friends
I
cleard
him
with
five
talents
Greet
him
from
me
Bid
him
suppose
some
good
necessity
Touches
his
friend
which
craves
to
be
remembred
With
those
five
talents
That
had
givet
these
fellows
To
whom
tis
instant
due
Nevr
speak
or
think
That
Timons
fortunes
mong
his
friends
can
sink
I
would
I
could
not
think
it
That
thought
is
bountys
foe
Being
free
itself
it
thinks
all
others
so
I
house
waiting
to
speak
with
Enter
to
him
I
have
told
my
lord
of
you
he
is
coming
down
to
you
I
thank
you
sir
Enter
Heres
my
lord
Aside
One
of
Lord
Timons

warrant
Why

I
dreamt
of

Flaminius

Fill

bountiful
good
lord

master
His

I
am
right
glad
that
his
health
is
well
sir
And
what
hast
thou
there
under
thy
cloak
pretty
Flaminius
Faith
nothing
but
an
empty
box
sir
which
in
my
lords
behalf
I
come
to
entreat
your
honour
to
supply
who
having
great
and
instant
occasion
to
use
fifty
talents
hath
sent
to
your
lordship
to
furnish
him
nothing
doubting
your
present
assistance
therein
La
la
la

Nothing
doubting
says
he
Alas
good
lord
a
noble
gentleman
tis
if
he
would
not
keep
so
good
a
house
Many
a
time
and
often
I
ha
dind
with
him
and
told
him
ont
and
come
again
to
supper
to
him
of
purpose
to
have
him
spend
less
and
yet
he
would
embrace
no
counsel
take
no
warning
by
my
coming
Every
man
has
his
fault
and
honesty
is
his
I
ha
told
him
ont
but
I
could
neer
get
him
fromt
Reenter
with
wine
Please
your
lordship
here
is
the
wine
Flaminius
I
have
noted
thee
always

Heres
to
thee
Your
lordship
speaks
your
pleasure
I
have
observed
thee
always
for
a
towardly
prompt
spirit
give
thee
thy
due
and
one
that
knows
what
belongs
to
reason

Good
parts
in
thee
To
Get
you
gone
sirrah
nearer
honest
Flaminius
Thy
lords
a
bountiful
gentleman
but
thou
art
wise
and
thou
knowst
well
enough
although
thou
comst
to
me
that
this
is
no
time
to
lend
money
especially
upon
bare
friendship
without
security
Heres
three
solidares
for
thee
Good
boy
wink
at
me
and
say
thou
sawst
me
not
Fare
thee
well
Ist
possible
the
world
should
so
much
differ
And
we
alive
that
livd
Fly
damned
baseness
To
him
that
worships
thee
Throwing
the
money
back
Ha
Now
I
see
thou
art
a
fool
and
fit
for
thy
master
May
these
add
to
the
number
that
may
scald
thee
Let
molten
coin
be
thy
damnation
Thou
disease
of
a
friend
and
not
himself
Has
friendship
such
a
faint
and
milky
heart
It
turns
in
less
than
two
nights
you
gods
I
feel
my
masters
passion
This
slave
Unto
his
honour
has
my
lords
meat
in
him
Why
should
it
thrive
and
turn
to
nutriment
When
he
is
turnd
to
poison
may
diseases
only
work
upont
And
when
hes
sick
to
death
let
not
that
part
of
nature
Which
my
lord
paid
for
be
of
any
power
To
expel
sickness
but
prolong
his
hour
house
Enter
and
a
of
Must
he
needs
trouble
me
int
Hum
Bove
all
others
He
might
have
tried
Lord
Lucius
or
Lucullus
And
now
Ventidius
is
wealthy
too
Whom
he
redeemd
from
prison
All
these
Owe
their
estates
unto
him
My
lord
They
have
all
been
touchd
and
found
base
metal
for
They
have
all
denied
him
How
Have
they
denied
him
Has
Ventidius
and
Lucullus
denied
him
And
does
he
send
to
me
Three
Humh
It
shows
but
little
love
or
judgment
in
him
Must
I
be
his
last
refuge
His
friends
like
physicians
Thrice
give
him
over
Must
I
take
th
cure
upon
me
Has
much
disgracd
me
int
Im
angry
at
him
That
might
have
known
my
place
I
see
no
sense
fort
But
his
occasions
might
have
wood
me
first
For
in
my
conscience
I
was
the
first
man
That
eer
received
gift
from
him
And
does
he
think
so
backwardly
of
me
now
That
Ill
requite
it
last
No
So
it
may
prove
an
argument
of
laughter
To
th
rest
and
I
mongst
lords
be
thought
a
fool
Id
rather
than
the
worth
of
thrice
the
sum
Had
sent
to
me
first
but
for
my
minds
sake
Id
such
a
courage
to
do
him
good
But
now
return
And
with
their
faint
reply
this
answer
join
Who
bates
mine
honour
shall
not
know
my
coin
Excellent
Your
lordships
a
goodly
villain
The
devil
knew
not
what
he
did
when
he
made
man
politic
he
crossd
himself
byt
and
I
cannot
think
but
in
the
end
the
villainies
of
man
will
set
him
clear
How
fairly
this
lord
strives
to
appear
foul
Takes
virtuous
copies
to
be
wicked
like
those
that
under
hot
ardent
zeal
would
set
whole
realms
on
fire
Of
such
a
nature
is
his
politic
love
This
was
my
lords
best
hope
now
all
are
fled
Save
only
the
gods
Now
his
friends
are
dead
Doors
that
were
neer
acquainted
with
their
wards
Many
a
bounteous
year
must
be
employd
Now
to
guard
sure
their
master
And
this
is
all
a
liberal
course
allows
Who
cannot
keep
his
wealth
must
keep
his
house
My
lord
you
have
my
voice
tot
the
faults
bloody
Tis
necessary
he
should
die
Nothing
emboldens
sin
so
much
as
mercy
Most
true
the
law
shall
bruise
him
Honour
health
and
compassion
to
the
Senate
Now
Captain
I
am
an
humble
suitor
to
your
virtues
For
pity
is
the
virtue
of
the
law
And
none
but
tyrants
use
it
cruelly
It
pleases
time
and
fortune
to
lie
heavy
Upon
a
friend
of
mine
who
in
hot
blood
Hath
steppd
into
the
law
which
is
past
depth
To
those
that
without
heed
do
plunge
intot
He
is
a
man
setting
his
fate
aside
Of
comely
virtues
Nor
did
he
soil
the
fact
with
cowardice
An
honour
in
him
which
buys
out
his
fault
But
with
a
noble
fury
and
fair
spirit
Seeing
his
reputation
touchd
to
death
He
did
oppose
his
foe
And
with
such
sober
and
unnoted
passion
He
did
behove
his
anger
ere
twas
spent
As
if
he
had
but
provd
an
argument
You
undergo
too
strict
a
paradox
Striving
to
make
an
ugly
deed
look
fair
Your
words
have
took
such
pains
as
if
they
labourd
To
bring
manslaughter
into
form
and
set
Quarrelling
upon
the
head
of
valour
which
indeed
Is
valour
misbegot
and
came
into
the
world
When
sects
and
factions
were
newly
born
Hes
truly
valiant
that
can
wisely
suffer
The
worst
that
man
can
breathe
And
make
his
wrongs
his
outsides
To
wear
them
like
his
raiment
carelessly
And
neer
prefer
his
injuries
to
his
heart
To
bring
it
into
danger
If
wrongs
be
evils
and
enforce
us
kill
What
folly
tis
to
hazard
life
for
ill
My
lord
You
cannot
make
gross
sins
look
clear
To
revenge
is
no
valour
but
to
bear
My
lords
then
under
favour
pardon
me
If
I
speak
like
a
captain
Why
do
fond
men
expose
themselves
to
battle
And
not
endure
all
threats
Sleep
upont
And
let
the
foes
quietly
cut
their
throats
Without
repugnancy
If
there
be
Such
valour
in
the
bearing
what
make
we
Abroad
Why
then
women
are
more
valiant
That
stay
at
home
if
bearing
carry
it
And
the
ass
more
captain
than
the
lion
the
fellow
Loaden
with
irons
wiser
than
the
judge
If
wisdom
be
in
suffering
my
lords
As
you
are
great
be
pitifully
good
Who
cannot
condemn
rashness
in
cold
blood
To
kill
I
grant
is
sins
extremest
gust
But
in
defence
by
mercy
tis
most
just
To
be
in
anger
is
impiety
But
who
is
man
that
is
not
angry
Weigh
but
the
crime
with
this
You
breathe
in
vain
In
vain
His
service
done
At
Lacedaemon
and
Byzantium
Were
a
sufficient
briber
for
his
life
Whats
that
Why
I
say
my
lords
has
done
fair
service
And
slain
in
fight
many
of
your
enemies
How
full
of
valour
did
he
bear
himself
In
the
last
conflict
and
made
plenteous
wounds
He
has
made
too
much
plenty
with
em
Hes
a
sworn
rioter
he
has
a
sin
that
often
Drowns
him
and
takes
his
valour
prisoner
If
there
were
no
foes
that
were
enough
To
overcome
him
In
that
beastly
fury
He
has
been
known
to
commit
outrages
And
cherish
factions
Tis
inferrd
to
us
His
days
are
foul
and
his
drink
dangerous
He
dies
Hard
fate
He
might
have
died
in
war
My
lords
if
not
for
any
parts
in
him
Though
his
right
arm
might
purchase
his
own
time
And
be
in
debt
to
none
yet
more
to
move
you
Take
my
deserts
to
his
and
join
em
both
And
for
I
know
your
reverend
ages
love
Security
Ill
pawn
my
victories
all
My
honours
to
you
upon
his
good
returns
If
by
this
crime
he
owes
the
law
his
life
Why
let
the
war
receivet
in
valiant
gore
For
law
is
strict
and
war
is
nothing
more
We
are
for
law
he
dies
Urge
it
no
more
On
height
of
our
displeasure
Friend
or
brother
He
forfeits
his
own
blood
that
spills
another
Must
it
be
so
It
must
not
be
My
lords
I
do
beseech
you
know
me
How
Call
me
to
your
remembrances
What
I
cannot
think
but
your
age
has
forgot
me
It
could
not
else
be
I
should
prove
so
base
To
sue
and
be
denied
such
common
grace
My
wounds
ache
at
you
Do
you
dare
our
anger
Tis
in
few
words
but
spacious
in
effect
We
banish
thee
for
ever
Banish
me
Banish
your
dotage
Banish
usury
That
makes
the
Senate
ugly
If
after
two
days
shine
Athens
contain
thee
Attend
our
weightier
judgment
And
not
to
swell
our
spirit
He
shall
be
executed
presently
Now
the
gods
keep
you
old
enough
that
you
may
live
Only
in
bone
that
none
may
look
on
you
Im
worse
than
mad
I
have
kept
back
their
foes
While
they
have
told
their
money
and
let
out
Their
coin
upon
large
interest
I
myself
Rich
only
in
large
hurts
All
those
for
this
Is
this
the
balsam
that
the
usuring
Senate
Pours
into
captains
wounds
Banishment
It
comes
not
ill
I
hate
not
to
be
banishd
It
is
a
cause
worthy
my
spleen
and
fury
That
I
may
strike
at
Athens
Ill
cheer
up
My
discontented
troops
and
lay
for
hearts
Tis
honour
with
most
lands
to
be
at
odds
Soldiers
should
brook
as
little
wrongs
as
gods
Hear
you
Master
Steward
wheres
our
master
Are
we
undone
cast
off
nothing
remaining
Alack
my
fellows
what
should
I
say
to
you
Let
me
be
recorded
by
the
righteous
gods
I
am
as
poor
as
you
Such
a
house
broke
So
noble
a
master
falln
All
gone
and
not
One
friend
to
take
his
fortune
by
the
arm
And
go
along
with
him
As
we
do
turn
our
backs
From
our
companion
thrown
into
his
grave
So
his
familiars
to
his
buried
fortunes
Slink
all
away
leave
their
false
vows
with
him
Like
empty
purses
pickd
and
his
poor
self
dedicated
beggar
to
the
air
With
his
disease
of
allshunnd
poverty
Walks
like
contempt
alone
More
of
our
fellows
Enter
other
All
broken
implements
of
a
ruind
house
Yet
do
our
hearts
wear
Timons
livery
That
see
I
by
our
faces
We
are
fellows
still
Serving
alike
in
sorrow
Leakd
is
our
bark
And
we
poor
mates
stand
on
the
dying
deck
Hearing
the
surges
threat
We
must
all
part
Into
this
sea
of
air
Good
fellows
all
The
latest
of
my
wealth
Ill
share
amongst
you
Wherever
we
shall
meet
for
Timons
sake
Lets
yet
be
fellows
lets
shake
our
heads
and
say
As
twere
a
knell
unto
our
masters
fortune
We
have
seen
better
days
Let
each
take
some
Giving
them
money
Nay
put
out
all
your
hands
Not
one
word
more
Thus
part
we
rich
in
sorrow
parting
poor
Embrace
and
part
several
ways
the
fierce
wretchedness
that
glory
brings
us
Who
would
not
wish
to
be
from
wealth
exempt
Since
riches
point
to
misery
and
contempt
Who
would
be
so
mockd
with
glory
or
to
live
But
in
a
dream
of
friendship
To
have
his
pomp
and
all
what
state
compounds
But
only
painted
like
his
varnishd
friends
Poor
honest
lord
brought
low
by
his
own
heart
Undone
by
goodness
Strange
unusual
blood
When
mans
worst
sin
is
he
does
too
much
good
Who
then
dares
to
be
half
so
kind
again
For
bounty
that
makes
gods
does
still
mar
men
My
dearest
lord
blest
to
be
most
accurst
Rich
only
to
be
wretched
thy
great
fortunes
Are
made
thy
chief
afflictions
Alas
kind
lord
Hes
flung
in
rage
from
this
ingrateful
seat
Of
monstrous
friends
nor
has
he
with
him
to
Supply
his
life
or
that
which
can
command
it
Ill
follow
and
enquire
him
out
Ill
ever
serve
his
mind
with
my
best
will
Whilst
I
have
gold
Ill
be
his
steward
still
Thou
hast
painfully
discoverd
are
his
files
As
full
as
thy
report
I
have
spoke
the
least
Besides
his
expedition
promises
Present
approach
We
stand
much
hazard
if
they
bring
not
Timon
I
met
a
courier
one
mine
ancient
friend
Whom
though
in
general
part
we
were
opposd
Yet
our
old
love
had
a
particular
force
And
made
us
speak
like
friends
This
man
was
riding
From
Alcibiades
to
Timons
cave
With
letters
of
entreaty
which
imported
His
fellowship
i
th
cause
against
your
city
In
part
for
his
sake
movd
Enter
the
other
from
Here
come
our
brothers
No
talk
of
Timon
nothing
of
him
expect
The
enemies
drum
is
heard
and
fearful
scouring
Doth
choke
the
air
with
dust
In
and
prepare
Ours
is
the
fall
I
fear
our
foes
the
snare
Sound
to
this
coward
and
lascivious
town
Our
terrible
approach
Sound
a
parley
The
appear
upon
the
walls
Till
now
you
have
gone
on
and
filld
the
time
With
all
licentious
measure
making
your
wills
The
scope
of
justice
till
now
myself
and
such
As
slept
within
the
shadow
of
your
power
Have
wanderd
with
our
traversd
arms
and
breathd
Our
sufferance
vainly
Now
the
time
is
flush
When
crouching
marrow
in
the
bearer
strong
Cries
of
itself
No
more
Now
breathless
wrong
Shall
sit
and
pant
in
your
great
chairs
of
ease
And
pursy
insolence
shall
break
his
wind
With
fear
and
horrid
flight
Noble
and
young
When
thy
first
griefs
were
but
a
mere
conceit
Ere
thou
hadst
power
or
we
had
cause
of
fear
We
sent
to
thee
to
give
thy
rages
balm
To
wipe
out
our
ingratitude
with
loves
Above
their
quantity
So
did
we
woo
Transformed
Timon
to
our
citys
love
By
humble
message
and
by
promisd
means
We
were
not
all
unkind
nor
all
deserve
The
common
stroke
of
war
These
walls
of
ours
Were
not
erected
by
their
hands
from
whom
You
have
receivd
your
griefs
nor
are
they
such
That
these
great
towrs
trophies
and
schools
should
fall
For
private
faults
in
them
Nor
are
they
living
Who
were
the
motives
that
you
first
went
out
Shame
that
they
wanted
cunning
in
excess
Hath
broke
their
hearts
March
noble
lord
Into
our
city
with
thy
banners
spread
By
decimation
and
a
tithed
death
If
thy
revenges
hunger
for
that
food
Which
nature
loathes
take
thou
the
destind
tenth
And
by
the
hazard
of
the
spotted
die
Let
die
the
spotted
All
have
not
offended
For
those
that
were
it
is
not
square
to
take
On
those
that
are
revenge
crimes
like
lands
Are
not
inherited
Then
dear
countryman
Bring
in
thy
ranks
but
leave
without
thy
rage
Spare
thy
Athenian
cradle
and
those
kin
Which
in
the
bluster
of
thy
wrath
must
fall
With
those
that
have
offended
Like
a
shepherd
Approach
the
fold
and
cull
th
infected
forth
But
kill
not
all
together
What
thou
wilt
Thou
rather
shalt
enforce
it
with
thy
smile
Than
hew
tot
with
thy
sword
Set
but
thy
foot
Against
our
rampird
gates
and
they
shall
ope
So
thou
wilt
send
thy
gentle
heart
before
To
say
thout
enter
friendly
Throw
thy
glove
Or
any
token
of
thine
honour
else
That
thou
wilt
use
the
wars
as
thy
redress
And
not
as
our
confusion
all
thy
powers
Shall
make
their
harbour
in
our
town
till
we
Have
seald
thy
full
desire
Then
theres
my
glove
Descend
and
open
your
uncharged
ports
Those
enemies
of
Timons
and
mine
own
Whom
you
yourselves
shall
set
out
for
reproof
Fall
and
no
more
And
to
atone
your
fears
With
my
more
noble
meaning
not
a
man
Shall
pass
his
quarter
or
offend
the
stream
Of
regular
justice
in
your
citys
bounds
But
shall
be
renderd
to
your
public
laws
At
heaviest
answer
Tis
most
nobly
spoken
Descend
and
keep
your
words
The
descend
and
open
the
gates
Enter
a
as
a
Messenger
My
noble
General
Timon
is
dead
Entombd
upon
the
very
hem
o
th
sea
And
on
his
gravestone
this
insculpture
which
With
wax
I
brought
away
whose
soft
impression
Interprets
for
my
poor
ignorance
reads
the
Epitaph
Here
lies
a
wretched
corse
of
wretched
soul
bereft
Seek
not
my
name
plague
consume
you
wicked
caitiffs
left
Here
lie
I
Timon
who
alive
all
living
men
did
hate
Pass
by
and
curse
thy
fill
but
pass
and
stay
not
here
thy
gait
These
well
express
in
thee
thy
latter
spirits
Though
thou
abhorrdst
in
us
our
human
griefs
Scorndst
our
brains
flow
and
those
our
droplets
which
From
niggard
nature
fall
yet
rich
conceit
Taught
thee
to
make
vast
Neptune
weep
for
aye
On
thy
low
grave
on
faults
forgiven
Dead
Is
noble
Timon
of
whose
memory
Hereafter
more
Bring
me
into
your
city
And
I
will
use
the
olive
with
my
sword
Make
war
breed
peace
make
peace
stint
war
make
each
Prescribe
to
other
as
each
others
leech
Let
our
drums
strike
forest
near
Rome
Enter
and
his
three
sons
making
a
noise
with
hounds
and
horns
and
The
hunt
is
up
the
morn
is
bright
and
grey
The
fields
are
fragrant
and
the
woods
are
green
Uncouple
here
and
let
us
make
a
bay
And
wake
the
Emperor
and
his
lovely
bride
And
rouse
the
Prince
and
ring
a
hunters
peal
That
all
the
court
may
echo
with
the
noise
Sons
let
it
be
your
charge
as
it
is
ours
To
attend
the
Emperors
person
carefully
I
have
been
troubled
in
my
sleep
this
night
But
dawning
day
new
comfort
hath
inspird
Here
a
cry
of
hounds
and
wind
horns
in
a
peal
Then
enter
and
their
attendants
Many
good
morrows
to
your
Majesty
Madam
to
you
as
many
and
as
good
I
promised
your
Grace
a
hunters
peal
And
you
have
rung
it
lustily
my
lords
Somewhat
too
early
for
newmarried
ladies
Lavinia
how
say
you
I
say
no
I
have
been
broad
awake
two
hours
and
more
Come
on
then
horse
and
chariots
let
us
have
And
to
our
sport
To
Madam
now
shall
ye
see
Our
Roman
hunting
I
have
dogs
my
lord
Will
rouse
the
proudest
panther
in
the
chase
And
climb
the
highest
promontory
top
And
I
have
horse
will
follow
where
the
game
Makes
way
and
run
like
swallows
oer
the
plain
Chiron
we
hunt
not
we
with
horse
nor
hound
But
hope
to
pluck
a
dainty
doe
to
ground
So
now
go
tell
an
if
thy
tongue
can
speak
Who
twas
that
cut
thy
tongue
and
ravishd
thee
Write
down
thy
mind
bewray
thy
meaning
so
An
if
thy
stumps
will
let
thee
play
the
scribe
See
how
with
signs
and
tokens
she
can
scrowl
Go
home
call
for
sweet
water
wash
thy
hands
She
hath
no
tongue
to
call
nor
hands
to
wash
And
so
lets
leave
her
to
her
silent
walks
An
twere
my
cause
I
should
go
hang
myself
If
thou
hadst
hands
to
help
thee
knit
the
cord
Wind
horns
Enter
from
hunting
Who
is
this
my
niece
that
flies
away
so
fast
Cousin
a
word
where
is
your
husband
If
I
do
dream
would
all
my
wealth
would
wake
me
If
I
do
wake
some
planet
strike
me
down
That
I
may
slumber
an
eternal
sleep
Speak
gentle
niece
What
stern
ungentle
hands
Hath
loppd
and
hewd
and
made
thy
body
bare
Of
her
two
branches
those
sweet
ornaments
Whose
circling
shadows
kings
have
sought
to
sleep
in
And
might
not
gain
so
great
a
happiness
As
half
thy
love
Why
dost
not
speak
to
me
Alas
a
crimson
river
of
warm
blood
Like
to
a
bubbling
fountain
stirrd
with
wind
Doth
rise
and
fall
between
thy
rosed
lips
Coming
and
going
with
thy
honey
breath
But
sure
some
Tereus
hath
deflowered
thee
And
lest
thou
shouldst
detect
him
cut
thy
tongue
Ah
now
thou
turnst
away
thy
face
for
shame
And
notwithstanding
all
this
loss
of
blood
As
from
a
conduit
with
three
issuing
spouts
Yet
do
thy
cheeks
look
red
as
Titans
face
Blushing
to
be
encountred
with
a
cloud
Shall
I
speak
for
thee
Shall
I
say
tis
so
that
I
knew
thy
heart
and
knew
the
beast
That
I
might
rail
at
him
to
ease
my
mind
Sorrow
concealed
like
an
oven
stoppd
Doth
burn
the
heart
to
cinders
where
it
is
Fair
Philomel
why
she
but
lost
her
tongue
And
in
a
tedious
sampler
sewd
her
mind
But
lovely
niece
that
mean
is
cut
from
thee
craftier
Tereus
cousin
hast
thou
met
And
he
hath
cut
those
pretty
fingers
off
That
could
have
better
sewd
than
Philomel
had
the
monster
seen
those
lily
hands
Tremble
like
aspen
leaves
upon
a
lute
And
make
the
silken
strings
delight
to
kiss
them
He
would
not
then
have
touchd
them
for
his
life
Or
had
he
heard
the
heavenly
harmony
Which
that
sweet
tongue
hath
made
He
would
have
droppd
his
knife
and
fell
asleep
As
Cerberus
at
the
Thracian
poets
feet
Come
let
us
go
and
make
thy
father
blind
For
such
a
sight
will
blind
a
fathers
eye
One
hours
storm
will
drown
the
fragrant
meads
What
will
whole
months
of
tears
thy
fathers
eyes
Do
not
draw
back
for
we
will
mourn
with
thee
could
our
mourning
case
thy
misery
I

Enter

with
two
sons
and
bound
passing
on
the
stage
to

place
of
execution
and
going

pleading
Hear
me
grave
fathers
noble
Tribunes
stay
For
pity
of
mine
age
whose
youth
was
spent
In
dangerous
wars
whilst
you
securely
slept
For
all
my
blood
in
Romes
great
quarrel
shed
For
all
the
frosty
nights
that
I
have
watchd
And
for
these
bitter
tears
which
now
you
see
Filling
the
aged
wrinkles
in
my
cheeks
Be
pitiful
to
my
condemned
sons
Whose
souls
are
not
corrupted
as
tis
thought
For
two
and
twenty
sons
I
never
wept
Because
they
died
in
honours
lofty
bed
lieth
down
and
the
judges
pass
by
him
with
the
prisoners
and
exeunt
For
these
Tribunes
in
the
dust
I
write
My
hearts
deep
languor
and
my
souls
sad
tears
Let
my
tears
stanch
the
earths
dry
appetite
My
sons
sweet
blood
will
make
it
shame
and
blush
earth
I
will
befriend
thee
more
with
rain
That
shall
distil
from
these
two
ancient
urns
Than
youthful
April
shall
with
all
his
showrs
In
summers
drought
Ill
drop
upon
thee
still
In
winter
with
warm
tears
Ill
melt
the
snow
And
keep
eternal
springtime
on
thy
face
So
thou
refuse
to
drink
my
dear
sons
blood
Enter
Lucius
with
his
weapon
drawn
reverend
Tribunes
gentle
aged
men
Unbind
my
sons
reverse
the
doom
of
death
And
let
me
say
that
never
wept
before
My
tears
are
now
prevailing
orators
noble
father
you
lament
in
vain
The
Tribunes
hear
you
not
no
man
is
by
And
you
recount
your
sorrows
to
a
stone
Ah
Lucius
for
thy
brothers
let
me
plead
Grave
Tribunes
once
more
I
entreat
of
you
My
gracious
lord
no
tribune
hears
you
speak
Why
tis
no
matter
man
if
they
did
hear
They
would
not
mark
me
if
they
did
mark
They
would
not
pity
me
yet
plead
I
must
And
bootless
unto
them
Therefore
I
tell
my
sorrows
to
the
stones
Who
though
they
cannot
answer
my
distress
Yet
in
some
sort
they
are
better
than
the
Tribunes
For
that
they
will
not
intercept
my
tale
When
I
do
weep
they
humbly
at
my
feet
Receive
my
tears
and
seem
to
weep
with
me
And
were
they
but
attired
in
grave
weeds
Rome
could
afford
no
tribunes
like
to
these
stone
is
soft
as
wax
tribunes
more
hard
than
stones
stone
is
silent
and
offendeth
not
And
tribunes
with
their
tongues
doom
men
to
death
Rises
But
wherefore
standst
thou
with
thy
weapon
drawn
To
rescue
my
two
brothers
from
their
death
For
which
attempt
the
judges
have
pronouncd
My
everlasting
doom
of
banishment
happy
man
they
have
befriended
thee
Why
foolish
Lucius
dost
thou
not
perceive
That
Rome
is
but
a
wilderness
of
tigers
Tigers
must
prey
and
Rome
affords
no
prey
But
me
and
mine
how
happy
art
thou
then
From
these
devourers
to
be
banished
But
who
comes
with
our
brother
Marcus
here
Enter
with
Titus
prepare
thy
aged
eyes
to
weep
Or
if
not
so
thy
noble
heart
to
break
I
bring
consuming
sorrow
to
thine
age
Will
it
consume
me
Let
me
see
it
then
This
was
thy
daughter
Why
Marcus
so
she
is
Ay
me
this
object
kills
me
Fainthearted
boy
arise
and
look
upon
her
Speak
Lavinia
what
accursed
hand
Hath
made
thee
handless
in
thy
fathers
sight
What
fool
hath
added
water
to
the
sea
Or
brought
a
fagot
to
brightburning
Troy
My
grief
was
at
the
height
before
thou
camst
And
now
like
Nilus
it
disdaineth
bounds
Give
me
a
sword
Ill
chop
off
my
hands
too
For
they
have
fought
for
Rome
and
all
in
vain
And
they
have
nursd
this
woe
in
feeding
life
In
bootless
prayer
have
they
been
held
up
And
they
have
servd
me
to
effectless
use
Now
all
the
service
I
require
of
them
Is
that
the
one
will
help
to
cut
the
other
Tis
well
Lavinia
that
thou
hast
no
hands
For
hands
to
do
Rome
service
is
but
vain
Speak
gentle
sister
who
hath
martyrd
thee
that
delightful
engine
of
her
thoughts
That
blabbd
them
with
such
pleasing
eloquence
Is
torn
from
forth
that
pretty
hollow
cage
Where
like
a
sweet
melodious
bird
it
sung
Sweet
varied
notes
enchanting
every
ear
say
thou
for
her
who
hath
done
this
deed
thus
I
found
her
straying
in
the
park
Seeking
to
hide
herself
as
doth
the
deer
That
hath
receivd
some
unrecuring
wound
It
was
my
dear
and
he
that
wounded
her
Hath
hurt
me
more
than
had
he
killd
me
dead
For
now
I
stand
as
one
upon
a
rock
Environd
with
a
wilderness
of
sea
Who
marks
the
waxing
tide
grow
wave
by
wave
Expecting
ever
when
some
envious
surge
Will
in
his
brinish
bowels
swallow
him
This
way
to
death
my
wretched
sons
are
gone
Here
stands
my
other
son
a
banishd
man
And
here
my
brother
weeping
at
my
woes
But
that
which
gives
my
soul
the
greatest
spurn
Is
dear
Lavinia
dearer
than
my
soul
Had
I
but
seen
thy
picture
in
this
plight
It
would
have
madded
me
what
shall
I
do
Now
I
behold
thy
lively
body
so
Thou
hast
no
hands
to
wipe
away
thy
tears
Nor
tongue
to
tell
me
who
hath
martyrd
thee
Thy
husband
he
is
dead
and
for
his
death
Thy
brothers
are
condemnd
and
dead
by
this
Look
Marcus
Ah
son
Lucius
look
on
her
When
I
did
name
her
brothers
then
fresh
tears
Stood
on
her
cheeks
as
doth
the
honey
dew
Upon
a
gathred
lily
almost
withered
Perchance
she
weeps
because
they
killd
her
husband
Perchance
because
she
knows
them
innocent
If
they
did
kill
thy
husband
then
be
joyful
Because
the
law
hath
taen
revenge
on
them
No
no
they
would
not
do
so
foul
a
deed
Witness
the
sorrow
that
their
sister
makes
Gentle
Lavinia
let
me
kiss
thy
lips
Or
make
some
sign
how
I
may
do
thee
ease
Shall
thy
good
uncle
and
thy
brother
Lucius
And
thou
and
I
sit
round
about
some
fountain
Looking
all
downwards
to
behold
our
cheeks
How
they
are
staind
like
meadows
yet
not
dry
With
miry
slime
left
on
them
by
a
flood
And
in
the
fountain
shall
we
gaze
so
long
Till
the
fresh
taste
be
taken
from
that
clearness
And
made
a
brinepit
with
our
bitter
tears
Or
shall
we
cut
away
our
hands
like
thine
Or
shall
we
bite
our
tongues
and
in
dumb
shows
Pass
the
remainder
of
our
hateful
days
What
shall
we
do
Let
us
that
have
our
tongues
Plot
some
device
of
further
misery
To
make
us
wonderd
at
in
time
to
come
Sweet
father
cease
your
tears
for
at
your
grief
See
how
my
wretched
sister
sobs
and
weeps
Patience
dear
niece
Good
Titus
dry
thine
eyes
Ah
Marcus
Marcus
Brother
well
I
wot
Thy
napkin
cannot
drink
a
tear
of
mine
For
thou
poor
man
hast
drownd
it
with
thine
own
Ah
my
Lavinia
I
will
wipe
thy
cheeks
Mark
Marcus
mark
I
understand
her
signs
Had
she
a
tongue
to
speak
now
would
she
say
That
to
her
brother
which
I
said
to
thee
His
napkin
with
his
true
tears
all
bewet
Can
do
no
service
on
her
sorrowful
cheeks
what
a
sympathy
of
woe
is
this
As
far
from
help
as
Limbo
is
from
bliss
Enter
the
Moor
Titus
Andronicus
my
lord
the
Emperor
Sends
thee
this
word
that
if
thou
love
thy
sons
Let
Marcus
Lucius
or
thyself
old
Titus
Or
any
one
of
you
chop
off
your
hand
And
send
it
to
the
King
he
for
the
same
Will
send
thee
hither
both
thy
sons
alive
And
that
shall
be
the
ransom
for
their
fault
gracious
Emperor
gentle
Aaron
Did
ever
raven
sing
so
like
a
lark
That
gives
sweet
tidings
of
the
suns
uprise
With
all
my
heart
Ill
send
the
Emperor
my
hand
Good
Aaron
wilt
thou
help
to
chop
it
off
Stay
father
for
that
noble
hand
of
thine
That
hath
thrown
down
so
many
enemies
Shall
not
be
sent
My
hand
will
serve
the
turn
My
youth
can
better
spare
my
blood
than
you
And
therefore
mine
shall
save
my
brothers
lives
Which
of
your
hands
hath
not
defended
Rome
And
reard
aloft
the
bloody
battleaxe
Writing
destruction
on
the
enemys
castle
none
of
both
but
are
of
high
desert
My
hand
hath
been
but
idle
let
it
serve
To
ransom
my
two
nephews
from
their
death
Then
have
I
kept
it
to
a
worthy
end
Nay
come
agree
whose
hand
shall
go
along
For
fear
they
die
before
their
pardon
come
My
hand
shall
go
By
heaven
it
shall
not
go
Sirs
strive
no
more
such
withred
herbs
as
these
Are
meet
for
plucking
up
and
therefore
mine
Sweet
father
if
I
shall
be
thought
thy
son
Let
me
redeem
my
brothers
both
from
death
And
for
our
fathers
sake
and
mothers
care
Now
let
me
show
a
brothers
love
to
thee
Agree
between
you
I
will
spare
my
hand
Then
Ill
go
fetch
an
axe
But
I
will
use
the
axe
Come
hither
Aaron
Ill
deceive
them
both
Lend
me
thy
hand
and
I
will
give
thee
mine
Aside
If
that
be
calld
deceit
I
will
be
honest
And
never
whilst
I
live
deceive
men
so
But
Ill
deceive
you
in
another
sort
And
that
youll
say
ere
half
an
hour
pass
He
cuts
off
hand
Reenter
and
Now
stay
your
strife
What
shall
be
is
dispatchd
Good
Aaron
give
his
Majesty
my
hand
Tell
him
it
was
a
hand
that
warded
him
From
thousand
dangers
bid
him
bury
it
More
hath
it
merited
that
let
it
have
As
for
my
sons
say
I
account
of
them
As
jewels
purchasd
at
an
easy
price
And
yet
dear
too
because
I
bought
mine
own
I
go
Andronicus
and
for
thy
hand
Look
by
and
by
to
have
thy
sons
with
thee
Aside
Their
heads
I
mean
how
this
villainy
Doth
fat
me
with
the
very
thoughts
of
it
Let
fools
do
good
and
fair
men
call
for
grace
Aaron
will
have
his
soul
black
like
his
face
here
I
lift
this
one
hand
up
to
heaven
And
bow
this
feeble
ruin
to
the
earth
If
any
power
pities
wretched
tears
To
that
I
call
To
What
wouldst
thou
kneel
with
me
Do
then
dear
heart
for
heaven
shall
hear
our
prayers
Or
with
our
sighs
well
breathe
the
welkin
dim
And
stain
the
sun
with
fog
as
sometime
clouds
When
they
do
hug
him
in
their
melting
bosoms
brother
speak
with
possibility
And
do
not
break
into
these
deep
extremes
Is
not
my
sorrow
deep
having
no
bottom
Then
be
my
passions
bottomless
with
them
But
yet
let
reason
govern
thy
lament
If
there
were
reason
for
these
miseries
Then
into
limits
could
I
bind
my
woes
When
heaven
doth
weep
doth
not
the
earth
oerflow
If
the
winds
rage
doth
not
the
sea
wax
mad
Threatning
the
welkin
with
his
bigswoln
face
And
wilt
thou
have
a
reason
for
this
coil
I
am
the
sea
hark
how
her
sighs
do
blow
She
is
the
weeping
welkin
I
the
earth
Then
must
my
sea
be
moved
with
her
sighs
Then
must
my
earth
with
her
continual
tears
Become
a
deluge
overflowd
and
drownd
For
why
my
bowels
cannot
hide
her
woes
But
like
a
drunkard
must
I
vomit
them
Then
give
me
leave
for
losers
will
have
leave
To
ease
their
stomachs
with
their
bitter
tongues
Enter
a
with
two
heads
and
a
hand
Worthy
Andronicus
ill
art
thou
repaid
For
that
good
hand
thou
sentst
the
Emperor
Here
are
the
heads
of
thy
two
noble
sons
And
heres
thy
hand
in
scorn
to
thee
sent
back
Thy
grief
their
sports
thy
resolution
mockd
That
woe
is
me
to
think
upon
thy
woes
More
than
remembrance
of
my
fathers
death
Now
let
hot
Aetna
cool
in
Sicily
And
be
my
heart
an
everburning
hell
These
miseries
are
more
than
may
be
borne
To
weep
with
them
that
weep
doth
ease
some
deal
But
sorrow
flouted
at
is
double
death
Ah
that
this
sight
should
make
so
deep
a
wound
And
yet
detested
life
not
shrink
thereat
That
ever
death
should
let
life
bear
his
name
Where
life
hath
no
more
interest
but
to
breathe
kisses
Alas
poor
heart
that
kiss
is
comfortless
As
frozen
water
to
a
starved
snake
When
will
this
fearful
slumber
have
an
end
Now
farewell
flattry
die
Andronicus
Thou
dost
not
slumber
see
thy
two
sons
heads
Thy
warlike
hand
thy
mangled
daughter
here
Thy
other
banishd
son
with
this
dear
sight
Struck
pale
and
bloodless
and
thy
brother
I
Even
like
a
stony
image
cold
and
numb
Ah
now
no
more
will
I
control
thy
griefs
Rent
off
thy
silver
hair
thy
other
hand
Gnawing
with
thy
teeth
and
be
this
dismal
sight
The
closing
up
of
our
most
wretched
eyes
Now
is
a
time
to
storm
why
art
thou
still
Ha
ha
ha
Why
dost
thou
laugh
It
fits
not
with
this
hour
Why
I
have
not
another
tear
to
shed
Besides
this
sorrow
is
an
enemy
And
would
usurp
upon
my
watry
eyes
And
make
them
blind
with
tributary
tears
Then
which
way
shall
I
find
Revenges
cave
For
these
two
heads
do
seem
to
speak
to
me
And
threat
me
I
shall
never
come
to
bliss
Till
all
these
mischiefs
be
returnd
again
Even
in
their
throats
that
have
committed
them
Come
let
me
see
what
task
I
have
to
do
You
heavy
people
circle
me
about
That
I
may
turn
me
to
each
one
of
you
And
swear
unto
my
soul
to
right
your
wrongs
The
vow
is
made
Come
brother
take
a
head
And
in
this
hand
the
other
will
I
bear
And
Lavinia
thou
shalt
be
employd
in
this
Bear
thou
my
hand
sweet
wench
between
thy
teeth
As
for
thee
boy
go
get
thee
from
my
sight
Thou
art
an
exile
and
thou
must
not
stay
Hie
to
the
Goths
and
raise
an
army
there
And
if
ye
love
me
as
I
think
you
do
Lets
kiss
and
part
for
we
have
much
to
do
Farewell
Andronicus
my
noble
father
The
woefullst
man
that
ever
livd
in
Rome
Farewell
proud
Rome
till
Lucius
come
again
He

his
pledges
dearer
than

life
Farewell

noble
sister

wert
as
thou
tofore
hast
been
But
now
nor
Lucius

But

hateful
griefs
If
Lucius

he
will
requite
your
wrongs
And
make
proud
Saturnine
and
his
emperess
Beg
at
the
gates
like
Tarquin
and
his
queen
Now

powr
To
be

on
Rome

verse

Horace
I

I
read
it
in
the
grammar
long

Ay

verse
in
Horace
Right

it
Aside
Now
what
a
thing
it
is
to
be
an
ass
Heres
no
sound
jest
The
old
man
hath
found
their
guilt
And
sends
them
weapons
wrappd
about
with
lines
That
wound
beyond
their
feeling
to
the
quick
But
were
our
witty
Empress
well
afoot
She
would
applaud
Andronicus
conceit
But
let
her
rest
in
her
unrest
awhile
And
now
young
lords
wast
not
a
happy
star
Led
us
to
Rome
strangers
and
more
than
so
Captives
to
be
advanced
to
this
height
It
did
me
good
before
the
palace
gate
To
brave
the
Tribune
in
his
brothers
hearing
But
me
more
good
to
see
so
great
a
lord
Basely
insinuate
and
send
us
gifts
Had
he
not
reason
Lord
Demetrius
Did
you
not
use
his
daughter
very
friendly
I
would
we
had
a
thousand
Roman
dames
At
such
a
bay
by
turn
to
serve
our
lust
charitable
wish
and
full
of
love
Here
lacks
but
your
mother
for
to
say
amen
And
that
would
she

twenty
thousand
more
Come
let

go
and
pray
to
all

For

her
pains
Aside
Pray

Why

Belike

Soft

Enter

Good

gentle
Aaron

undone
Now

Why

caterwauling

What

wrap
and
fumble
in
thy
arms
that
which
I
would

Amongst

The

Zounds

What

Ye

Coalblack

In

For

Wilt

My

By

Rome
will
despise
her
for
this
foul
escape
The
Emperor
in
his
rage
will
doom

death
I
blush
to

upon
this
ignomy
Why
theres
the

Fie
treacherous
hue
that
will
betray
with

The

Look

smiles
upon

As
who
should
say
Old
lad
I
am
thine
own
He
is
your
brother
lords
sensibly
fed
Of
that
selfblood
that
first
gave
life
to
you
And
from
your
womb
where
you
imprisoned
were
He
is
enfranchised
and
come
to
light
Nay
he
is
your
brother
by
the
surer
side
Although
my
seal
be
stamped
in
his
face
Aaron
what
shall
I
say
unto
the
Empress
Advise
thee
Aaron
what
is
to
be
done
And
we
will
all
subscribe
to
thy
advice
Save
thou
the
child
so
we
may
all
be
safe
Then
sit
we
down
and
let
us
all
consult
My
son
and
I
will
have
the
wind
of
you
Keep
there
now
talk
at
pleasure
of
your
safety
They
sit
How
many
women
saw
this
child
of
his
Why
so
brave
lords
When
we
join
in
league
I
am
a
lamb
but
if
you
brave
the
Moor
The
chafed
boar
the
mountain
lioness
The
ocean
swells
not
so
as
Aaron
storms
But
say
again
how
many
saw
the
child
Cornelia
the
midwife
and
myself
And
no
one
else
but
the
delivered
Empress
The
Emperess
the
midwife
and
yourself
Two
may
keep
counsel
when
the
thirds
away
Go
to
the
Empress
tell
her
this
I
said
He
kills
her
Weeke
weeke
So
cries
a
pig
prepared
to
the
spit
What
meanst
thou
Aaron
Wherefore
didst
thou
this
Lord
sir
tis
a
deed
of
policy
Shall
she
live
to
betray
this
guilt
of
ours
longtongud
babbling
gossip
No
lords
no
And
now
be
it
known
to
you
my
full
intent
Not
far
one
Muliteus
my
countryman
His
wife
but
yesternight
was
brought
to
bed
His
child
is
like
to
her
fair
as
you
are
Go
pack
with
him
and
give
the
mother
gold
And
tell
them
both
the
circumstance
of
all
And
how
by
this
their
child
shall
be
advancd
And
be
received
for
the
Emperors
heir
And
substituted
in
the
place
of
mine
To
calm
this
tempest
whirling
in
the
court
And
let
the
Emperor
dandle
him
for
his
own
Hark
ye
lords
You
see
I
have
given
her
physic
Pointing
to
the
And
you
must
needs
bestow
her
funeral
The
fields
are
near
and
you
are
gallant
grooms
This
done
see
that
you
take
no
longer
days
But
send
the
midwife
presently
to
me
The
midwife
and
the
nurse
well
made
away
Then
let
the
ladies
tattle
what
they
please
Aaron
I
see
thou
wilt
not
trust
the
air
With
secrets
For
this
care
of
Tamora
Herself
and
hers
are
highly
bound
to
thee
Now
to
the
Goths
as
swift
as
swallow
flies
There
to
dispose
this
treasure
in
mine
arms
And
secretly
to
greet
the
Empress
friends
Come
on
you
thicklippd
slave
Ill
bear
you
hence
For
it
is
you
that
puts
us
to
our
shifts
Ill
make
you
feed
on
berries
and
on
roots
And
feed
on
curds
and
whey
and
suck
the

And

and
bring
you
up
To
be
a
warrior
and
command
a
camp
and
others
The

the
arrows
in
his
hand
that
shot
at
him
Why
lords
what
wrongs
are
these
Was
ever
seen
An
emperor
in
Rome
thus
overborne
Troubled
confronted
thus
and
for
the
extent
Of
egal
justice
usd
in
such
contempt
My
lords
you
know
as
know
the
mightful
gods
However
these
disturbers
of
our
peace
Buzz
in
the
peoples
ears
there
nought
hath
passd
But
even
with
law
against
the
wilful
sons
Of
old
Andronicus
And
what
an
if
His
sorrows
have
so
overwhelmd
his
wits
Shall
we
be
thus
afflicted
in
his
wreaks
His
fits
his
frenzy
and
his
bitterness
And
now
he
writes
to
heaven
for
his
redress
See
heres
To
Jove
and
this
To
Mercury
This
To
Apollo
this
To
the
God
of
War
Sweet
scrolls
to
fly
about
the
streets
of
Rome
Whats
this
but
libelling
against
the
Senate
And
blazoning
our
unjustice
every
where
goodly
humour
is
it
not
my
lords
As
who
would
say
in
Rome
no
justice
were
But
if
I
live
his
feigned
ecstasies
Shall
be
no
shelter
to
these
outrages
But
he
and
his
shall
know
that
justice
lives
In
Saturninus
health
whom
if
she
sleep
Hell
so
awake
as
he
in
fury
shall
Cut
off
the
proudst
conspirator
that
lives
My
gracious
lord
my
lovely
Saturnine
Lord
of
my
life
commander
of
my
thoughts
Calm
thee
and
bear
the
faults
of
Titus
age
Th
effects
of
sorrow
for
his
valiant
sons
Whose
loss
hath
piercd
him
deep
and
scarrd
his
heart
And
rather
comfort
his
distressed
plight
Than
prosecute
the
meanest
or
the
best
For
these
contempts
Aside
Why
thus
it
shall
become
Highwitted
Tamora
to
gloze
with
all
But
Titus
I
have
touchd
thee
to
the
quick
Thy
lifeblood
out
if
Aaron
now
be
wise
Then
is
all
safe
the
anchor
in
the
port
Enter
How
now
good
fellow
Wouldst

speak
with
us
Yes
forsooth

Emperial
Empress

Emperor
Tis

letter
and

couple
of
pigeons

letter
Go

presently
How
much
money

I
have
Come

be
hangd
Hangd
byr
lady
then
I
have
brought
up
a
neck
to
a
fair
end
Despiteful
and
intolerable
wrongs
Shall
I
endure
this
monstrous
villainy
I
know
from
whence
this
same
device
proceeds
May
this
be
borne
as
if
his
traitorous
sons
That
died
by
law
for
murder
of
our
brother
Have
by
my
means
been
butchered
wrongfully
Go
drag
the
villain
hither
by
the
hair
Nor
age
nor
honour
shall
shape
privilege
For
this
proud
mock
Ill
be
thy
slaughterman
Sly
frantic
wretch
that
holpst
to
make
me
great
In
hope
thyself
should
govern
Rome
and
me
Enter
What
news
with
thee
Aemilius
Arm
my
lords
Rome
never
had
more
cause
The
Goths
have
gathered
head
and
with
a
power
Of
high
resolved
men
bent
to
the
spoil
They
hither
march
amain
under
conduct
Of
Lucius
son
to
old
Andronicus
Who
threats
in
course
of
this
revenge
to
do
As
much
as
ever
Coriolanus
did
Is
warlike
Lucius
general
of
the
Goths
These
tidings
nip
me
and
I
hang
the
head
As
flowers
with
frost
or
grass
beat
down
with
storms
Ay
now
begins
our
sorrows
to
approach
Tis
he
the
common
people
love
so
much
Myself
hath
often
heard
them
say
When
I
have
walked
like
a
private
man
That
Lucius
banishment
was
wrongfully
And
they
have
wishd
that
Lucius
were
their
emperor
Why
should
you
fear
Is
not
your
city
strong
Ay
but
the
citizens
favour
Lucius
And
will
revolt
from
me
to
succour
him
King
be
thy
thoughts
imperious
like
thy
name
Is
the
sun
dimmd
that
gnats
do
fly
in
it
The
eagle
suffers
little
birds
to
sing
And
is
not
careful
what
they
mean
thereby
Knowing
that
with
the
shadow
of
his
wings
He
can
at
pleasure
stint
their
melody
Even
so
mayest
thou
the
giddy
men
of
Rome
Then
cheer
thy
spirit
for
know
thou
Emperor
I
will
enchant
the
old
Andronicus
With
words
more
sweet
and
yet
more
dangerous
Than
baits
to
fish
or
honeystalks
to
sheep
When
as
the
one
is
wounded
with
the
bait
The
other
rotted
with
delicious
feed
But
he
will
not
entreat
his
son
for
us
If
Tamora
entreat
him
then
he
will
For
I
can
smooth
and
fill
his
aged
ears
With
golden
promises
that
were
his
heart
Almost
impregnable
his
old
ears
deaf
Yet
should
both
ear
and
heart
obey
my
tongue
To
Go
thou
before
to
be
our
ambassador
Say
that
the
Emperor
requests
a
parley
Of
warlike
Lucius
and
appoint
the
meeting
Even
at
his
fathers
house
the
old
Andronicus
Aemilius
do
this
message
honourably
And
if
he
stand
on
hostage
for
his
safety
Bid
him
demand
what
pledge
will
please
him
best
Your
bidding
shall
I
do
effectually
Now
will
I
to
that
old
Andronicus
And
temper
him
with
all
the
art
I
have
To
pluck
proud
Lucius
from
the
warlike
Goths
And
now
sweet
Emperor
be
blithe
again
And
bury
all
thy
fear
in
my
devices
Then
go
successantly
and
plead
to
him
I
Plains
near
Rome
Enter
with
an
army
of
with
drums
and
colours
Approved
warriors
and
my
faithful
friends
I
have
received
letters
from
great
Rome
Which
signifies
what
hate
they
bear
their
Emperor
And
how
desirous
of
our
sight
they
are
Therefore
great
lords
be
as
your
titles
witness
Imperious
and
impatient
of
your
wrongs
And
wherein
Rome
hath
done
you
any
scath
Let
him
make
treble
satisfaction
Brave
slip
sprung
from
the
great
Andronicus
Whose
name
was
once
our
terror
now
our
comfort
Whose
high
exploits
and
honourable
deeds
Ingrateful
Rome
requites
with
foul
contempt
Be
bold
in
us
well
follow
where
thou
leadst
Like
stinging
bees
in
hottest
summers
day
Led
by
their
master
to
the
flowred
fields
And
be
avengd
on
cursed
Tamora
And
as
he
saith
so
say
we
all
with
him
I
humbly
thank
him
and
I
thank
you
all
But
who
comes
here
led
by
a
lusty
Goth
Enter
a
leading
with
his
in
his
arms
Renowned
Lucius
from
our
troops
I
strayd
To
gaze
upon
a
ruinous
monastery
And
as
I
earnestly
did
fix
mine
eye
Upon
the
wasted
building
suddenly
I
heard
a
child
cry
underneath
a
wall
I
made
unto
the
noise
when
soon
I
heard
The
crying
babe
controlld
with
this
discourse
Peace
tawny
slave
half
me
and
half
thy
dam
Did
not
thy
hue
bewray
whose
brat
thou
art
Had
nature
lent
thee
but
thy
mothers
look
Villain
thou
mightst
have
been
an
emperor
But
where
the
bull
and
cow
are
both
milkwhite
They
never
do
beget
a
coalblack
calf
Peace
villain
peace
even
thus
he
rates
the
babe
For
I
must
bear
thee
to
a
trusty
Goth
Who
when
he
knows
thou
art
the
Empress
babe
Will
hold
thee
dearly
for
thy
mothers
sake
With
this
my
weapon
drawn
I
rushd
upon
him
Surprisd
him
suddenly
and
brought
him
hither
To
use
as
you
think
needful
of
the
man
worthy
Goth
this
is
the
incarnate
devil
That
robbd
Andronicus
of
his
good
hand
This
is
the
pearl
that
pleasd
your
Empress
eye
And
heres
the
base
fruit
of
her
burning
lust
Say
walleyd
slave
whither
wouldst
thou
convey
This
growing
image
of
thy
fiendlike
face
Why
dost
not
speak
What
deaf
Not
a
word
halter
soldiers
Hang
him
on
this
tree
And
by
his
side
his
fruit
of
bastardy
Touch
not
the
boy
he
is
of
royal
blood
Too
like
the
sire
for
ever
being
good
First
hang
the
child
that
he
may
see
it
sprawl
sight
to
vex
the
fathers
soul
withal
Get
me
a
ladder
ladder
brought
which
is
made
to
climb
Lucius
save
the
child
And
bear
it
from
me
to
the
Emperess
If
thou
do
this
Ill
show
thee
wondrous
things
That
highly
may
advantage
thee
to
hear
If
thou
wilt
not
befall
what
may
befall
Ill
speak
no
more
but
Vengeance
rot
you
all
Say
on
an
if
it
please
me
which
thou
speakst
Thy
child
shall
live
and
I
will
see
it
nourishd
An
if
it
please
thee
Why
assure
thee
Lucius
Twill
vex
thy
soul
to
hear
what
I
shall
speak
For
I
must
talk
of
murders
rapes
and
massacres
Acts
of
black
night
abominable
deeds
Complots
of
mischief
treason
villainies
Ruthful
to
hear
yet
piteously
performd
And
this
shall
all
be
buried
in
my
death
Unless
thou
swear
to
me
my
child
shall
live
Tell
on
thy
mind
I
say
thy
child
shall
live
Swear
that
he
shall
and
then
I
will
begin
Who
should
I
swear
by
Thou
believest
no
god
That
granted
how
canst
thou
believe
an
oath
What
if
I
do
not
as
indeed
I
do
not
Yet
for
I
know
thou
art
religious
And
hast
a
thing
within
thee
called
conscience
With
twenty
popish
tricks
and
ceremonies
Which
I
have
seen
thee
careful
to
observe
Therefore
I
urge
thy
oath
For
that
I
know
An
idiot
holds
his
bauble
for
a
god
And
keeps
the
oath
which
by
that
god
he
swears
To
that
Ill
urge
him
Therefore
thou
shalt
vow
By
that
same
god
what
god
soeer
it
be
That
thou
adorest
and
hast
in
reverence
To
save
my
boy
to
nourish
and
bring
him
up
Or
else
I
will
discover
nought
to
thee
Even
by
my
god
I
swear
to
thee
I
will
First
know
thou
I
begot
him
on
the
Empress
most
insatiate
and
luxurious
woman
Tut
Lucius
this
was
but
a
deed
of
charity
To
that
which
thou
shalt
hear
of
me
anon
Twas
her
two
sons
that
murdered
Bassianus
They
cut
thy
sisters
tongue
and
ravishd
her
And
cut
her
hands
and
trimmd
her
as
thou
sawest
detestable
villain
Callst
thou
that
trimming
Why
she
was
washd
and
cut
and
trimmd
and
twas
Trim
sport
for
them
which
had
the
doing
of
it
barbarous
beastly
villains
like
thyself
Indeed
I
was
their
tutor
to
instruct
them
That
codding
spirit
had
they
from
their
mother
As
sure
a
card
as
ever
won
the
set
That
bloody
mind
I
think
they
learnd
of
me
As
true
a
dog
as
ever
fought
at
head
Well
let
my
deeds
be
witness
of
my
worth
I
traind
thy
brethren
to
that
guileful
hole
Where
the
dead
corpse
of
Bassianus
lay
I
wrote
the
letter
that
thy
father
found
And
hid
the
gold
within
that
letter
mentiond
Confederate
with
the
Queen
and
her
two
sons
And
what
not
done
that
thou
hast
cause
to
rue
Wherein
I
had
no
stroke
of
mischief
in
it
I
playd
the
cheater
for
thy
fathers
hand
And
when
I
had
it
drew
myself
apart
And
almost
broke
my
heart
with
extreme
laughter
I
pried
me
through
the
crevice
of
a
wall
When
for
his
hand
he
had
his
two
sons
heads
Beheld
his
tears
and
laughd
so
heartily
That
both
mine
eyes
were
rainy
like
to
his
And
when
I
told
the
Empress
of
this
sport
She
swooned
almost
at
my
pleasing
tale
And
for
my
tidings
gave
me
twenty
kisses
What
canst
thou
say
all
this
and
never
blush
Ay
like
a
black
dog
as
the
saying
is
Art
thou
not
sorry
for
these
heinous
deeds
Ay
that
I
had
not
done
a
thousand
more
Even
now
I
curse
the
day
and
yet
I
think
Few
come
within
the
compass
of
my
curse
Wherein
I
did
not
some
notorious
ill
As
kill
a
man
or
else
devise
his
death
Ravish
a
maid
or
plot
the
way
to
do
it
Accuse
some
innocent
and
forswear
myself
Set
deadly
enmity
between
two
friends
Make
poor
mens
cattle
break
their
necks
Set
fire
on
barns
and
haystacks
in
the
night
And
bid
the
owners
quench
them
with
their
tears
Oft
have
I
diggd
up
dead
men
from
their
graves
And
set
them
upright
at
their
dear
friends
door
Even
when
their
sorrows
almost
was
forgot
And
on
their
skins
as
on
the
bark
of
trees
Have
with
my
knife
carved
in
Roman
letters
Let
not
your
sorrow
die
though
I
am
dead
Tut
I
have
done
a
thousand
dreadful
things
As
willingly
as
one
would
kill
a
fly
And
nothing
grieves
me
heartily
indeed
But
that
I
cannot
do
ten
thousand
more
Bring
down
the
devil
for
he
must
not
die
So
sweet
a
death
as
hanging
presently
If
there
be
devils
would
I
were
a
devil
To
live
and
burn
in
everlasting
fire
So
I
might
have
your
company
in
hell
But
to
torment
you
with
my
bitter
tongue
Sirs
stop
his
mouth
and
let
him
speak
no
more
Enter
My
lord
there

Rome
Desires

Let

Welcome

Goths
The
Roman
Emperor
greets

He
craves
a
parley

house
Willing

Let

Till

brought
unto
the
Empress
face
For
testimony
of
her
foul
proceedings
And
see
the
ambush
of
our
friends
be
strong
I
fear
the
Emperor
means
no
good
to
us
Some
devil
whisper
curses
in
my
ear
And
prompt
me
that
my
tongue
may
utter
forth
The
venomous
malice
of
my
swelling
heart
Away
inhuman
dog
unhallowed
slave
Sirs

The

For

this
Was
it
well
done
of
rash
Virginius
To
slay
his
daughter
with
his
own
right
hand
Because
she
was
enforcd
staind
and
deflowerd
It
was
Andronicus
Your
reason
mighty
lord
Because
the
girl
should
not
survive
her
shame
And
by
her
presence
still
renew
his

For

Die

He

And

What
hast
thou
done
unnatural
and
unkind
Killd
her
for
whom
my
tears
have
made
me
blind
I
am
as
woeful
as
Virginius
was
And
have
a
thousand
times
more
cause
than
he
To
do
this
outrage
and
it
now
is
done
What
was
she
ravishd
Tell
who
did
the
deed
Willt
please

Why

They

And

all
this
wrong
Go
fetch
them
hither
to
us
presently
Why
there
they
are
both
baked
in
this
pie
Whereof
their
mother
daintily
hath

Eating

hath
bred
Tis

He

deed
He

Can

Theres

for

He

and
their

go
up
into
the
balcony
You
sadfacd
men
people
and
sons
of
Rome
By
uproars
severd
as
a
flight
of
fowl
Scatterd
by
winds
and
high
tempestuous
gusts
let
me
teach
you
how
to
knit
again
This
scattered
corn
into
one
mutual
sheaf
These
broken
limbs
again
into
one
body
Lest
Rome
herself
be
bane
unto
herself
And
she
whom
mighty
kingdoms
curtsy
to
Like
a
forlorn
and
desperate
castaway
Do
shameful
execution
on
herself
But
if
my
frosty
signs
and
chaps
of
age
Grave
witnesses
of
true
experience
Cannot
induce
you
to
attend
my
words
To
Lucius
Speak
Romes
dear
friend
as
erst
our
ancestor
When
with
his
solemn
tongue
he
did
discourse
To
lovesick
Didos
sad
attending
ear
The
story
of
that
baleful
burning
night
When
subtle
Greeks
surprisd
King
Priams
Troy
Tell
us
what
Sinon
hath
bewitchd
our
ears
Or
who
hath
brought
the
fatal
engine
in
That
gives
our
Troy
our
Rome
the
civil
wound
My
heart
is
not
compact
of
flint
nor
steel
Nor
can
I
utter
all
our
bitter
grief
But
floods
of
tears
will
drown
my
oratory
And
break
my
uttrance
even
in
the
time
When
it
should
move
ye
to
attend
me
most
And
force
you
to
commiseration
Heres
Romes
young
Captain
let
him
tell
the
tale
While
I
stand
by
and
weep
to
hear
him
speak
Then
gracious
auditory
be
it
known
to
you
That
Chiron
and
the
damnd
Demetrius
Were
they
that
murdred
our
Emperors
brother
And
they
it
were
that
ravished
our
sister
For
their
fell
faults
our
brothers
were
beheaded
Our
fathers
tears
despisd
and
basely
cozend
Of
that
true
hand
that
fought
Romes
quarrel
out
And
sent
her
enemies
unto
the
grave
Lastly
myself
unkindly
banished
The
gates
shut
on
me
and
turnd
weeping
out
To
beg
relief
among
Romes
enemies
Who
drownd
their
enmity
in
my
true
tears
And
opd
their
arms
to
embrace
me
as
a
friend
I
am
the
turned
forth
be
it
known
to
you
That
have
preservd
her
welfare
in
my
blood
And
from
her
bosom
took
the
enemys
point
Sheathing
the
steel
in
my
adventrous
body
Alas
you
know
I
am
no
vaunter
I
My
scars
can
witness
dumb
although
they
are
That
my
report
is
just
and
full
of
truth
But
soft
methinks
I
do
digress
too
much
Citing
my
worthless
praise
pardon
me
For
when
no
friends
are
by
men
praise
themselves
Now
is
my
turn
to
speak
Behold
the
child
Pointing
to
the
in
an
attendants
arms
Of
this
was
Tamora
delivered
The
issue
of
an
irreligious
Moor
Chief
architect
and
plotter
of
these
woes
The
villain
is
alive
in
Titus
house
Damnd
as
he
is
to
witness
this
is
true
Now
judge
what
cause
had
Titus
to
revenge
These
wrongs
unspeakable
past
patience
Or
more
than
any
living
man
could
bear
Now
have
you
heard
the
truth
what
say
you
Romans
Have
we
done
aught
amiss
show
us
wherein
And
from
the
place
where
you
behold
us
pleading
The
poor
remainder
of
Andronici
Will
hand
in
hand
all
headlong
hurl
ourselves
And
on
the
ragged
stones
beat
forth
our
souls
And
make
a
mutual
closure
of
our
house
Speak
Romans
speak
and
if
you
say
we
shall
Lo
hand
in
hand
Lucius
and
I
will
fall
Come
come
thou
reverend
man
of
Rome
And
bring
our
Emperor
gently
in
thy
hand
Lucius

Emperor
for

The

be
so
Lucius

Go
go

house
And

To

As

wicked

others

Lucius
all
hail
Romes
gracious
governor
Thanks
gentle
Romans
May
I
govern
so
To
heal
Romes
harms
and
wipe
away
her
woe
But
gentle
people
give
me
aim
awhile
For
nature
puts
me
to
a
heavy
task
Stand
all
aloof
but
uncle
draw
you
near
To
shed
obsequious
tears
upon
this
trunk
take
this
warm
kiss
on
thy
pale
cold
lips
Kisses
These
sorrowful
drops
upon
thy
bloodstaind
face
The
last
true
duties
of
thy
noble
son
Tear
for
tear
and
loving
kiss
for
kiss
Thy
brother
Marcus
tenders
on
thy
lips
were
the
sum
of
these
that
I
should
pay
Countless
and
infinite
yet
would
I
pay
them
Come
hither
boy
come
come
come
and
learn
of
us
To
melt
in
showers
Thy
grandsire
lovd
thee
well
Many
a
time
he
dancd
thee
on
his
knee
Sung
thee
asleep
his
loving
breast
thy
pillow
Many
a
story
hath
he
told
to
thee
And
bid
thee
bear
his
pretty
tales
in
mind
And
talk
of
them
when
he
was
dead
and
gone
How
many
thousand
times
hath
these
poor
lips
When
they
were
living
warmd
themselves
on
thine
now
sweet
boy
give
them
their
latest
kiss
Bid
him
farewell
commit
him
to
the
grave
Do
them
that
kindness
and
take
leave
of
them
grandsire

evn
with
all
my

Would
I
were

you

Lord
I
cannot
speak
to
him
for
weeping
My
tears
will
choke
me
if
I
ope
my
mouth
Reenter
attendants
with
You
sad
Andronici
have
done
with
woes
Give
sentence
on
the
execrable
wretch
That
hath
been
breeder
of
these
dire
events
Set
him
breastdeep
in
earth
and
famish
him
There
let
him
stand
and
rave
and
cry
for
food
If
any
one
relieves
or
pities
him
For
the
offence
he
dies
This
is
our
doom
Some
stay
to
see
him
fastned
in
the
earth
Ah
why
should
wrath
be
mute
and
fury
dumb
I
am
no

I
that
with
base
prayers
I
should
repent
the
evils
I
have
done
Ten
thousand
worse

ever
yet
I
did
Would
I
perform
if
I
might
have
my
will
If
one
good
deed
in
all
my
life
I
did
I
do
repent
it
from
my
very
soul
Some
loving
friends
convey
the
Emperor
hence
And
give
him
burial
in
his

My

Be

No

No

burial
But
throw
her
forth
to

Her

And

The

ducats
a
year
Ay
but
hell
have
but
a
year
in
all
these
ducats
hes
a
very
fool
and
a
prodigal
Fie
that
youll
say
so
He
plays
o
th
violdegamboys
and
speaks
three
or
four
languages
word
for
word
without
book
and
hath
all
the
good
gifts
of
nature
He
hath
indeed
almost
natural
for
besides
that
hes
a
fool
hes
a
great
quarreller
and
but
that
he
hath
the
gift
of
a
coward
to
allay
the
gust
he
hath
in
quarrelling
tis
thought
among
the
prudent
he
would
quickly
have
the
gift
of
a
grave
By
this
hand
they
are
scoundrels
and
subtractors
that
say
so
of
him
Who
are
they
They
that
add
moreover
hes
drunk
nightly
in
your
company
With
drinking
healths
to
my
niece
Ill
drink
to
her
as
long
as
there
is
a
passage
in
my
throat
and
drink
in
Illyria
Hes
a
coward
and
a
coystrill
that
will
not
drink
to
my
niece
till
his
brains
turn
o
th
toe

Never

Methinks
sometimes
I
have
no
more
wit
than
a
Christian
or
an
ordinary
man

but
I
am
great
eater
of
beef
and
I
believe

harm
to
my
wit
No

An

thought
that
Id
forswear

Ill
ride

tomorrow
Sir
Toby
Pourquoi

I
had
bestowed
that
time
in
the
tongues
that
I
have
in
fencing
dancing
and
bearbaiting
Oh
had
I
but
followed
the
arts
Then
hadst
thou
had
an
excellent
head
of
hair
Why
would
that
have
mended
my
hair
Past
question
for
thou
seest
it
will
not
curl
by
nature
But
it
becomes
me
well
enough
doest
not
Excellent
it
hangs
like
flax
on
a
distaff
and
I
hope
to
see
a
huswife
take
thee
between
her
legs
and
spin
it
off
Faith
Ill
home
tomorrow
Sir
Toby
Your
niece
will
not
be
seen
or
if

Shell

Tut

I

i
th
world
I
delight
in
masques
and
revels
sometimes
altogether
Art

good
at
these
kickshawses
knight
As
any
man
in
Illyria
whatsoever
he
be
under
the
degree
of
my
betters
and
yet
I
will
not
compare
with
an
old
man
What
is
thy
excellence
in
a
galliard
knight
Faith
I
can
cut
a
caper
And
I
can
cut
the
mutton
tot
And
I
think
I
have
the
backtrick
simply
as
strong
as
any
man
in
Illyria
Wherefore
are
these
things
hid
Wherefore
have
these
gifts
a
curtain
before
em
Are
they
like
to
take
dust
like
Mistress
Malls
picture
Why
dost
thou
not
go
to
church
in
a
galliard
and
come
home
in
a
coranto
My
very
walk
should
be
a
jig
I
would
not
so
much
as
make
water
but
in
a
sinkapace
What
dost
thou
mean
Is
it
a
world
to
hide
virtues
in
I
did
think
by
the
excellent
constitution
of
thy
leg
it
was
formd
under
the
star
of
a
galliard
Ay
tis
strong
and
it
does
indifferent
well
in
flamecolourd
stock
Shall
we
set
about
some
revels
What
shall
we
do
else
Were
we
not
born
under
Taurus
Taurus
Thats
sides
and

No
sir
it
is
legs
and
thighs
Let
me
see
the
caper
Ha
higher
Ha
ha
excellent
house
Enter
and
Nay
either
tell
me
where
thou
hast
been
or
I
will
not
open
my
lips
so
wide
as
a
bristle
may
enter
in
way
of
thy
excuse
my
lady
will
hang
thee
for
thy
absence
Let
her
hang
me
He
that
is
well
hangd
in
this
world
needs
to
fear
no
colours
Make
that
good
He
shall
see
none
to
fear
good
lenten
answer
I
can
tell
thee
where
that
saying
was
born
of
I
fear
no
colours
Where
good
Mistress
Mary
In
the
wars
and
that
may
you
be
bold
to
say
in
your
foolery
Well
God
give
them
wisdom
that
have
it
and
those
that
are
fools
let
them
use
their
talents
Yet
you
will
be
hangd
for
being
so
long
absent
or
to
be
turnd
away
is
not
that
as
good
as
a
hanging
to
you
Many
a
good
hanging
prevents
a
bad
marriage
and
for
turning
away
let
summer
bear
it
out
You
are
resolute
then
Not
so
neither
but
I
am
resolvd
on
two
points
That
if
one
break
the
other
will
hold
or
if
both
break
your
gaskins
fall
Apt
in
good
faith
very
apt
Well
go
thy
way
if
Sir
Toby
would
leave
drinking
thou
wert
as
witty
a
piece
of
Eves
flesh
as
any
in
Illyria
Peace
you
rogue
no
more
o
that
Here
comes
my
lady
Make
your
excuse
wisely
you
were
best
Enter
and
Wit
ant
be
thy
will
put
me
into
good
fooling
Those
wits
that
think
they
have
thee
do
very
oft
prove
fools
and
I
that
am
sure
I
lack
thee
may
pass
for
a
wise
man
For
what
says
Quinapalus
Better
a
witty
fool
than
a
foolish
wit
God
bless
thee
lady
Take
the
fool
away
Do
you
not
hear
fellows
Take
away
the
lady
Go
to
yare
a
dry
fool
Ill
no
more
of
you
Besides
you
grow
dishonest
Two
faults
madonna
that
drink
and
good
counsel
will
amend
for
give
the
dry
fool
drink
then
is
the
fool
not
dry
Bid
the
dishonest
man
mend
himself
if
he
mend
he
is
no
longer
dishonest
if
he
cannot
let
the
botcher
mend
him
Anything
thats
mended
is
but
patchd
virtue
that
transgresses
is
but
patchd
with
sin
and
sin
that
amends
is
but
patchd
with
virtue
If
that
this
simple
syllogism
will
serve
so
if
it
will
not
what
remedy
As
there
is
no
true
cuckold
but
calamity
so
beautys
a
flower
The
lady
bade
take
away
the
fool
therefore
I
say
again
take
her
away
Sir
I
bade
them
take
away
you
Misprision
in
the
highest
degree
Lady
Cucullus
non
facit
monachum
thats
as
much
to
say
as
I
wear
not
motley
in
my

Good

give
me
leave
to
prove
you
a
fool
Can
you
do
it
Dexteriously

madonna
Make
your
proof
I
must
catechize
you
for
it
madonna
Good
my
mouse
of
virtue
answer
me
Well
sir
for
want
of
other
idleness
Ill
bide
your
proof
Good
madonna
why
mournst
thou
Good
fool
for
my
brothers
death
I
think
his
soul
is
in
hell
madonna
I
know
his
soul
is
in
heaven
fool
The
more
fool
madonna
to
mourn
for
your
brothers
soul
being
in
heaven
Take
away
the
fool
gentlemen
What
think
you
of
this
fool
Malvolio
Doth
he
not
mend
Yes
and
shall
do
till
the
pangs
of
death
shake
him
Infirmity
that
decays
the
wise
doth
ever
make
the
better
fool
God
send
you
sir
a
speedy
infirmity
for
the
better
increasing
your
folly
Sir
Toby
will
be
sworn
that
I
am
no
fox
but
he
will
not
pass
his
word
for
twopence
that
you
are
no
fool
How
say
you
to
that
Malvolio
I
marvel
your
ladyship
takes
delight
in
such
a
barren
rascal
I
saw
him
put
down
the
other
day
with
an
ordinary
fool
that
has
no
more
brain
than
a
stone
Look
you
now
hes
out
of
his
guard
already
unless
you
laugh
and
minister
occasion
to
him
he
is
gaggd
I
protest
I
take
these
wise
men
that
crow
so
at
these
set
kind
of
fools
no
better
than
the
fools
zanies
you
are
sick
of
selflove
Malvolio
and
taste
with
a
distemperd
appetite
To
be
generous
guiltless
and
of
free
disposition
is
to
take
those
things
for
birdbolts
that
you
deem
cannon
bullets
There
is
no
slander
in
an
allowd
fool
though
he
do
nothing
but
rail
nor
no
railing
in
known
discreet
man
though
he
do
nothing
but
reprove

therefore
comes
to
speak
with
you
I
told
him
you

asleep
he

Of

Not
yet
old

nor
young

for
a
boy
as
a

a
peascod
or
a
codling
when
tis
almost
an
apple
tis
with
him
in
standing
water
between
boy
and
man
He
is
very
wellfavourd
and
he
speaks
very
shrewishly
one
would
think
his
mothers
milk
were
scarce
out
of
him
Let
him
approach
Call

Orsinos
embassy
Enter
The
honourable
lady
of
the
house
which
is
she
Speak
to
me
I
shall
answer
for
her
Your
will
Most
radiant
exquisite
and
unmatchable
beauty
I
pray
you
tell
me
if
this
be
the
lady
of
the
house
for
I
never
saw
her
I
would
be
loath
to
cast
away
my
speech
for
besides
that
it
is
excellently
well
pennd
I
have
taken
great
pains
to
con
it
Good
beauties
let
me
sustain
no
scorn
I
am
very
comptible
even
to
the
least
sinister
usage
Whence
came
you
sir
I
can
say
little
more
than
I
have
studied
and
that
questions
out
of
my
part
Good
gentle
one
give
me
modest
assurance
if
you
be
the
lady
of
the
house
that
I
may
proceed
in
my
speech
Are
you
a
comedian
No
my
profound
heart
and
yet
by
the
very
fangs
of
malice
I
swear
I
am
not
that
I
play
Are
you
the
lady
of
the
house
If
I
do
not
usurp
myself
I
am
Most
certain
if
you
are
she
you
do
usurp
yourself
for
what
is
yours
to
bestow
is
not
yours
to
reserve
But
this
is
from
my
commission
I
will
on
with
my
speech
in
your
praise
and
then
show
you
the
heart
of
my
message
Come
to
what
is
important
int
I
forgive
you
the
praise
Alas
I
took
great
pains
to
study
it
and
tis
poetical
It
is
the
more
like
to
be
feigned
I
pray
you
keep
it
in
I
heard
you
were
saucy
at
my
gates
and
allowd
your
approach
rather
to
wonder
at
you
than
to
hear
you
If
you
be
not
mad
be
gone
if
you
have
reason
be
brief
tis
not
that
time
of
moon
with
me
to
make
one
in
so
skipping
dialogue
Will
you
hoist
sail
sir
Here
lies
your
way
No
good
swabber
I
am
to
hull
here
a
little
longer
Some
mollification
for
your
giant
sweet
lady
Tell
me
your
mind
I
am
a
messenger
Sure
you
have
some
hideous
matter
to
deliver
when
the
courtesy
of
it
is
so
fearful
Speak
your
office
It
alone
concerns
your
ear
I
bring
no
overture
of
war
no
taxation
of
homage
I
hold
the
olive
in
my
hand
my
words
are
as
full
of
peace
as
matter
Yet
you
began
rudely
What
are
you
What
would
you
The
rudeness
that
hath
appeard
in
me
have
I
learnd
from
my
entertainment
What
I
am
and
what
I
would
are
as
secret
as
maidenhead
to
your
cars
divinity
to
any
others
profanation
Give
us
the
place
alone
we
will
hear
this
divinity
Most
sweet
lady
comfortable
doctrine
and
much
may
be
said
of
it
Where
lies
your
text
In
Orsinos
bosom
In
his
bosom
In
what
chapter
of
his
bosom
To
answer
by
the
method
in
the
first
of
his
heart
I
have
read
it
it
is
heresy
Have
you
no
more
to
say
Good
madam
let
me
see
your
face
Have
you
any
commission
from
your
lord
to
negotiate
with
my
face
You
are
now
out
of
your
text
but
we
will
draw
the
curtain
and
show
you
the
picture
Unveiling
Look

Ist

Excellently

are
the
cruellst
she
alive
If
you
will
lead
these
graces
to
the
grave
And
leave
the
world
no
copy
sir
I
will
not
be
so
hardhearted
I
will
give
out
divers
schedules
of
my
beauty
It
shall
be
inventoried
and
every
particle
and
utensil
labelld
to
my
will
as
item
two
lips
indifferent
red
item
two
grey
eyes
with
lids
to
them
item
one
neck
one
chin
and
so
forth
Were
you
sent
hither
to
praise
me
I
see
you
what
you
are
you
are
too
proud
But
if
you
were
the
devil
you
are
fair
My
lord
and
master
loves
you
such
love
Could
be
but
recompensd
though
you
were
crownd
The
nonpareil
of
beauty
How
does
he
love
me
With
adorations
fertile
tears
With
groans
that
thunder
love
with
sighs
of
fire
Your
lord
does
know
my
mind
I
cannot
love
him
Yet
I
suppose
him
virtuous
know
him
noble
Of
great
estate
of
fresh
and
stainless
youth
In
voices
well
divulgd
free
learnd
and
valiant
And
in
dimension
and
the
shape
of
nature
gracious
person
but
yet
I
cannot
love
him
He
might
have
took
his
answer
long
ago
If
I
did
love
you
in
my
masters
flame
With
such
a
suffring
such
a
deadly
life
In
your
denial
I
would
find
no
sense
I
would
not
understand
it
Why
what
would
you
Make
me
a
willow
cabin
at
your
gate
And
call
upon
my
soul
within
the
house
Write
loyal
cantons
of
contemned
love
And
sing
them
loud
even
in
the
dead
of
night
Halloo
your
name
to
the
reverberate
hals
And
make
the
babbling
gossip
of
the
air
Cry
out
Olivia
you
should
not
rest
Between
the
elements
of
air
and
earth
But
you
should
pity
me
You
might
do
much
What
is
your
parentage
Above
my
fortunes
yet
my
state
is
well
I
am
a
gentleman
Get
you
to
your
lord
I
cannot
love
him
let
him
send
no
more
Unless
perchance
you
come
to
me
again
To
tell
me
how
he
takes
it
Fare
you
well
I
thank
you
for
your
pains
spend
this
for
me
I
am
no
feed
post
lady
keep
your
purse
My
master
not
myself
lacks
recompense
Love
make
his
heart
of
flint
that
you
shall
love
And
let
your
fervour
like
my
masters
be
Placd
in
contempt
Farewell
fair
cruelty
What
is
your
parentage
Above
my
fortunes
yet
my
state
is
well
I
am
a
gentleman
Ill
be
sworn
thou
art
Thy
tongue
thy
face
thy
limbs
actions
and
spirit
Do
give
thee
fivefold
blazon
Not
too
fast
Soft
soft
Unless
the
master
were
the
man
How
now
Even
so
quickly
may
one
catch
the
plague
Methinks
I
feel
this
youths
perfections
With
an
invisible
and
subtle
stealth
To
creep
in
at
mine
eyes
Well
let
it
be
What
ho
Malvolio
Reenter
Here
madam
at
your
service
Run
after
that
same
peevish
messenger
The
Countys
man
He
left
this
ring
behind
him
Would
I
or
not
Tell
him
Ill
none
of
it
Desire
him
not
to
flatter
with
his
lord
Nor
hold
him
up
with
hopes
I
am
not
for
him
If
that
the
youth
will
come
this
way
tomorrow
Ill
give
him
reasons
fort
Hie
thee
Malvolio
Madam
I
will
I
do
I

and
fear
to
find
Mine

too
great
a
flatterer
for
my

Fate
show

do
not
owe
What
is
decreed
must
be
and
be
this
so
I
The
seacoast
Enter
and
Will
you
stay
no
longer
nor
will
you
not
that
I
go
with
you
By
your
patience
no
My
stars
shine
darkly
over
me
the
malignancy
of
my
fate
might
perhaps
distemper
yours
therefore
I
shall
crave
of
you
your
leave
that
I
may
bear
my
evils
alone
It
were
a
bad
recompense
for
your
love
to
lay
any
of
them
on
you
Let
me
know
of
you
whither
you
are
bound
No
sooth
sir
my
determinate
voyage
is
mere
extravagancy
But
I
perceive
in
you
so
excellent
a
touch
of
modesty
that
you
will
not
extort
from
me
what
I
am
willing
to
keep
in
therefore
it
charges
me
in
manners
the
rather
to
express
myself
You
must
know
of
me
then
Antonio
my
name
is
Sebastian
which
I
calld
Roderigo
my
father
was
that
Sebastian
of
Messaline
whom
I
know
you
have
heard
of
He
left
behind
him
myself
and
a
sister
both
born
in
an
hour
if
the
heavens
had
been
pleasd
would
we
had
so
ended
But
you
sir
alterd
that
for
some
hour
before
you
took
me
from
the
breach
of
the
sea
was
my
sister
drownd
Alas
the
day
lady
sir
though
it
was
said
she
much
resembled
me
was
yet
of
many
accounted
beautiful
but
though
I
could
not
with
such
estimable
wonder
overfar
believe
that
yet
thus
far
I
will
boldly
publish
her
she
bore
mind
that
envy
could
not
but
call
fair
She
is
drownd
already
sir
with
salt
water
though
I
seem
to
drown
her
remembrance
again
with
more
Pardon
me
sir
your
bad
entertainment
good
Antonio
forgive
me
your
trouble
If
you
will
not
murder
me
for
my
love
let
me
be
your
servant
If
you
will
not
undo
what
you
have
done
that
is
kill
him
whom
you
have
recoverddesire
it
not
Fare
ye
well
at
once
my
bosom
is
full
of
kindness
and
I
am
yet
so
near
the
manners
of
my
mother
that
upon
the
least
occasion
more
mine
eyes
will
tell
tales
of
me
I
am
bound
to
the
Count
Orsinos
court
Farewell
The
gentleness
of
all
the
gods

thee
I
have
many
cnemies
in
Orsinos
court
Else
would
I
very
shortly
see
thee
there
But
come
what
may
I
do
adore
thee
so
That
danger
shall
seem
sport

I
will

be

tonight

was

out

quiet
For
Monsieur
Malvolio
let
me
alone
with
him
if
I
do
not
gull
him
into
a
nayword
and
make
him
a
common
recreation
do
not

I
know
I
can
do
it
Possess
us
possess

tell

something
of
him
Marry
sir
sometimes
he
is
a
kind
of
Puritan

I
thought
that
Id
beat
him
like
a
dog
What
for
being
a
Puritan
Thy
exquisite
reason
dear
knight
I
have
no
exquisite
reason
fort
but
I
have
reason
good
enough
The
devil
a
Puritan
that
he
is
or
anything
constantly
but
a
timepleaser
an
affectiond
ass
that
cons
state
without
book
and
utters
it
by
great
swarths
the
best
persuaded
of
himself
so
crammd
as
he
thinks
with
excellencies
that
it
is
his
grounds
of
faith
that
all
that
look
on
him
love
him
and
on
that
vice
in
him
will
my
revenge
find
notable
cause
to
work
What
wilt
thou
do
I
will
drop
in
his
way
some
obscure
epistles
of
love
wherein
by
the
colour
of
his
beard
the
shape
of
his
leg
the
manner
of
his
gait
the
expressure
of
his
eye
forehead
and
complexion
he
shall
find
himself
most
feelingly
personated
I
can
write
very
like
my
lady
your
niece
on
forgotten
matter
we
can
hardly
make
distinction
of
our
hands
Excellent
I
smell
a
device
I
havet
in
my
nose
too
He
shall
think
by
the
letters
that
thou
wilt
drop
that
they
come
from
my
niece
and
that
shes
in
love
with
him
My
purpose
is
indeed
a
horse
of
that
colour
And
your
horse
now
would
make
him
an
ass
Ass
I
doubt

be
admirable
Sport
royal
I
warrant
you
I
know
my
physic
will
work
with
him
I
will
plant
you
two
and
let
the
fool
make
a
third
where
he
shall
find
the
letter
observe
his
construction
of
it
For
this
night

dream
on
the

shadow

half
hour
Observe
him
for
the
love
of
mockery
for
I
know
this
letter
will
make
a
contemplative
idiot
of
him
Close

of
jesting
As

Lie

near

be
one
of
my
complexion
Besides

uses

exalted
respect

follows
her

Ah

Pistol

Peace

There
is

fort
the
Lady
of
the
Strachy
married
the
yeoman
of
the
wardrobe
Fie
on
him
Jezebel
peace
Now
hes
deeply
in
look
how
imagination
blows
him
Having
been
three
months
married
to
her
sitting
in
my
state
for
a
stonebow
to
hit
him
in
the
eye
Calling
my
officers
about
me
in
my
branchd
velvet
gown
having
come
from
a
daybed
where
I
have
left
Olivia
sleeping
Fire
and
brimstone
peace
peace
And
then
to
have
the
humour
of
state
and
after
a
demure
travel
of
regard
telling
them
I
know
my
place
as
I
would
they
should
do
theirs
to
ask
for
my
kinsman
Toby
Bolts
and
shackles
peace
peace
peace
Now
now
Seven
of
my
people
with
an
obedient
start
make
out
for
him
I
frown
the
while
and
perchance
wind
up
my
watch
or
play
with
my
some
rich
jewel
Toby
approaches
curtsies
there
to
me
Shall
this
fellow
live
Though
our
silence
be
drawn
from
us
with
cars
yet
peace
I
extend
my
hand
to
him
thus
quenching
my
familiar
smile
with
an
austere
regard
of
control
And
does
not
Toby
take
you
a
blow
o
the
lips
then
Saying
Cousin
Toby
my
fortunes
having
cast
me
on
your
niece
give
me
this
prerogative
of
speech
What
what
You
must
amend
your
drunkenness
Out
scab
Nay
patience
or
we
break
the
sinews
of
our
plot
Besides
you
waste
the
treasure
of
your
time
with
a
foolish
knight
Thats
me
I
warrant
you
One
Sir
Andrew
I
knew
twas
I
for
many
do
call
me
fool
What
employment
have
we
here
Taking
up
the
letter
Now
is
the
woodcock
near
the
gin
peace
And
the
spirit
of
humours
intimate
reading
aloud
to
him
By
my

this

It

No

No

If

Malvolio
Marry
hang

Reads
I
may
command
where
I

But
silence
like
a
Lucrece
knife
With
bloodless
stroke
my
heart
doth
gore
I
doth
sway
my

fustian
riddle
Excellent
wench
say
I
I
doth
sway
my
life
Nay
but
first
let
me
see
let
me
see
let
me
see
What
dish
o
poison
has
she
dressd
him
And
with
what
wing
the
staniel
checks
at
it
I
may
command
where
I
adore
Why
she
may
command
me
I
serve
her
she
is
my
lady
Why
this
is
evident
to
any
formal
capacity
there
is
no
obstruction
in
this
And
the
end
what
should
that
alphabetical
position
portend
If
I
could
make
that
resemble
something
in
me
Softly
I
ay
make
up
that
He
is
now
at
a
cold
scent
Sowter
will
cry
upont
for
all
this
though
it
be
as
rank
as
a
fox
Malvolio
why
that
begins
my
name
Did
not
I
say
he
would
work
it
out
The
cur
is
excellent
at
faults
But
then
there
is
no
consonancy
in
the
sequel
that
suffers
under
probation
should
follow
but
does
And
shall
end
I
hope
Ay
or
Ill
cudgel
him
and
make
him
cry
And
then
I
comes
behind
Ay
an
you
had
any
eye
behind
you
you
might
see
more
detraction
at
your
heels
than
fortunes
before
you
I
This
simulation
is
not
as
the
former
and
yet
to
crush
this
a
little
it
would
bow
to
me
for
every
one
of
these
letters
are
in
my
name
Soft
here
follows
prose
Reads
If
this
fall
into
thy
hand
revolve
In
my
stars
I
am
above
thee
but
be
not
afraid
of
greatness
Some
are
born
great
some
achieve
greatness
and
some
have
greatness
thrust
upon
em
Thy
Fates
open
their
hands
let
thy
blood
and
spirit
embrace
them
and
to
inure
thyself
to
what
thou
art
like
to
be
cast
thy
humble
slough
and
appear
fresh
Be
opposite
with
a
kinsman
surly
with
servants
let
thy
tongue
tang
arguments
of
state
put
thyself
into
the
trick
of
singularity
She
thus
advises
thee
that
sighs
for
thee
Remember
who
commended
thy
yellow
stockings
and
wishd
to
see
thee
ever
crossgarterd
I
say
remember
Go
to
thou
art
made
if
thou
desirst
to
be
so
if
not
let
me
see
thee
a
steward
still
the
fellow
of
servants
and
not
worthy
to
touch
Fortunes
fingers
Farewell
She
that
would
alter
services
with
thee
Daylight
and
champain
discovers
not
more
This
is
open
I
will
be
proud
I
will
read
politic
authors
I
will
baffle
Sir
Toby
I
will
wash
off
gross
acquaintance
I
will
be
pointdevise
the
very
man
I
do
not
now
fool
myself
to
let
imagination
jade
me
for
every
reason
excites
to
this
that
my
lady
loves
me
She
did
commend
my
yellow
stockings
of
late
she
did
praise
my
leg
being
crossgarterd
and
in
this
she
manifests
herself
to
my
love
and
with
a
kind
of
injunction
drives
me
to
these
habits
of
her
liking
I
thank
my
stars
I
am
happy
I
will
be
strange
stout
in
yellow
stockings
and
crossgarterd
even
with
the
swiftness
of
putting
on
Jove
and
my
stars
be
praised
Here
is
yet
a
postscript
Reads
Thou
canst
not
choose
but
know
who
I
am
If
thou
entertainst
my
love
let
it
appear
in
thy
smiling
thy
smiles
become
thee
well
Therefore
in
my
presence
still
smile
dear
my
sweet
I
prithee
Jove
I
thank
thee
I
will
smile
I
will
do
everything
that
thou
wilt
have
me
I
will
not
give
my
part
of
this
sport
for
a
pension
of
thousands
to
be
paid
from
the
Sophy
I
could
marry
this
wench
for
this
device
So
could
I
too
And
ask
no
other
dowry
with
her
but
such
another
jest
Enter
Nor
I
neither
Here
comes
my
noble
gullcatcher
Wilt
thou
set
thy
foot
o
my
neck
Or
o
mine
either
Shall
I
play
my
freedom
at
traytrip
and
become
thy
bondslave
I
faith
or
I
either
Why
thou
hast
put
him
in
such
a
dream
that
when
the
image
of
it
leaves
him
he
must
run
mad
Nay
but
say
true
does
it
work
upon
him
Like
aquavita
with
a
midwife
If
you
will
then
see
the
fruits
of
the
sport
mark
his
first
approach
before
my
lady
He
will
come
to
her
in
yellow
stockings
and
tis
a
colour
she
abhors
and
crossgarterd
a
fashion
she
detests
and
he
will
smile
upon
her
which
will
now
be
so
unsuitable
to
her
disposition
being
addicted
to
a
melancholy
as
she
is
that
it
cannot
but
turn
him
into
a
notable
contempt
If
you
will
see
it
follow
me
To
the
gates
of
Tartar
thou
most
excellent
devil
of
wit
Ill
make
one
too
I
garden
Enter
and
with
a
tabor
Save
thee
friend
and
thy
music
Dost
thou
live
by
thy
tabor
No
sir
I
live
by
the
church
Art
thou
a
churchman
No
such
matter
sir
I
do
live
by
the
church
for
I
do
live
at
my
house
and
my
house
doth
stand
by
the
church
So
thou
mayst
say
the
king
lies
by
a
beggar
if
a
beggar
dwell
near
him
or
the
church
stands
by
thy
tabor
if
thy
tabor
stand
by
the
church
You
have
said
sir
To
see
this
age
sentence
is
but
a
chevril
glove
to
a
good
wit
How
quickly
the
wrong
side
may
be
turnd
outward
Nay
thats
certain
they
that
dally
nicely
with
words
may
quickly
make
them
wanton
I
would
therefore
my
sister
had
had
name
sir
Why
man
Why
sir
her
names
a
word
and
to
dally
with
that
word
might
make
my
sister
wanton
But
indeed
words
are
very
rascals
since
bonds
disgracd
them
Thy
reason
man
Troth
sir
I
can
yield
you
none
without
words
and
words
are
grown
so
false
I
am
loath
to
prove
reason
with
them
I
warrant
thou
art
a
merry
fellow
and
carst
for
nothing
Not
so
sir
I
do
care
for
something
but
in
my
conscience
sir
I
do
not
care
for
you
If
that
be
to
care
for
nothing
sir
I
would
it
would
make
you
invisible
Art
not
thou
the
Lady
Olivias
fool
No
indeed
sir
the
Lady
Olivia
has
no
folly
she
will
keep
no
fool
sir
till
she
be
married
and
fools
are
as
like
husbands
as
pilchers
are
to
herrings
the
husbands
the
bigger
I
am
indeed
not
her
fool
but
her
corrupter
of
words
I
saw
thee
late
at
the
Count
Orsinos
Foolery
sir
does
walk
about
the
orb
like
the
sun
it
shines
everywhere
I
would
be
sorry
sir
but
the
fool
should
be
as
oft
with
your
master
as
with
my
mistress
think
I
saw
your
wisdom
there
Nay
an
thou
pass
upon
me
Ill
no
more
with
thee
Hold
theres
expenses
for
thee
Giving
a
coin
Now
Jove
in
his
next
commodity
of
hair
send
the
a
beard
By
my
troth
Ill
tell
thee
I
am
almost
sick
for
one
Aside
though
I
would
not
have
it
grow
on
my
chin
Is
thy
lady
within
Would
not
a
pair
of
these
have
bred
sir
Yes
being
kept
together
and
put
to
use
I
would
play
Lord
Pandarus
of
Phrygia
sir
to
bring
a
Cressida
to
this
Troilus
I
understand
you
sir
tis
well
beggd
Giving
another
coin
The
matter
I
hope
is
not
great
sir
begging
but
a
beggar
Cressida
was
a
beggar
My
lady
is
within
sir
I
will
construe
to
them
whence
you
come
who
you
are
and
what
you
would
are
out
of
my
welkin
I
might
say
element
but
the
word
is
overworn
This
fellow
is
wise
enough
to
play
the
fool
And
to
do
that
well
craves
a
kind
of
wit
He
must
observe
their
mood
on
whom
he
jests
The
quality
of
persons
and
the
time
And
like
the
haggard
check
at
every
feather
That
comes
before
his
eye
This
is
a
practice
As
full
of
labour
as
a
wise
mans
art
For
folly
that
he
wisely
shows
is
fit
But
wise
men
follyfalln
quite
taint
their
wit
Enter
and
Save
you
gentleman
And
you
sir
Dieu
vous
garde
monsieur
Et
vous
aussi
votre
serviteur
I
hope
sir
you
are
and
I
am
yours
Will
you
encounter
the
house
My
niece
is
desirous
you
should
enter
if
your
trade
be
to
her
I
am
bound
to
your
niece
sir
I
mean
she
is
the
list
of
my
voyage
Taste
your
legs
sir
put
them
to
motion
My
legs
do
better
understand
me
sir
than
I
understand
what
you
mean
by
bidding
me
taste
my
legs
I
mean
to
go
sir
to
enter
I
will
answer
you
with
gait
and
entrance
But
we
are
prevented
Enter
and
Most
excellent
accomplishd
lady
the
heavens
rain
odours
on
you
That
youths
a
rare
courtier
Rain
odours
well
My
matter
hath
no
voice
lady
but
to
your
own
most
pregnant
and
vouchsafed
car
Odours
pregnant
and
vouchsafed
Ill
get
em
all
three
all
ready
Let
the
garden
door
be
shut
and
leave
me
to
my
hearing
My
duty
madam
and
most
humble
service
What
is
your
name
Cesario
is
your
servants
name
fair
Princess
My
servant
sir
Twas
never
merry
world
Since
lowly
feigning
was
calld
compliment
Yare
servant
to
the
Count
Orsino
youth
And
he
is
yours
and
his
must
needs
be
yours
Your
servants
servant
is
your
servant
madam
For
him
I
think
not
on
him
for
his
thoughts
Would
they
were
blanks
rather
than
filld
with
me
Madam
I
come
to
whet
your
gentle
thoughts
On
his
behalf
by
your
leave
I
pray
you
I
bade
you
never
speak
again
of
him
But
would
you
undertake
another
suit
I
had
rather
hear
you
to
solicit
that
Than
music
from
the
spheres
Dear
lady
Give
me
leave
beseech
you
I
did
send
After
the
last
enchantment
you
did
here
ring
in
chase
of
you
so
did
I
abuse
Myself
my
servant
and
I
fear
me
you
Under
your
hard
construction
must
I
sit
To
force
that
on
you
in
a
shameful
cunning
Which
you
knew
none
of
yours
What
might
you
think
Have
you
not
set
mine
honour
at
the
stake
And
baited
it
with
all
th
unmuzzled
thoughts
That
tyrannous
heart
can
think
To
one
of
your
receiving
Enough
is
shown
a
cypress
not
a
bosom
Hides
my
heart
So
let
me
hear
you
speak
I
Pity
Thats
a
degree
to
love
No
not
a
grize
for
tis
a
vulgar
proof
That
very
oft
we
pity
enemies
Why
then
methinks
tis
time
to
smile
again
world
how
apt
the
poor
are
to
be
proud
If
one
should
be
a
prey
how
much
the
better
To
fall
before
the
lion
than
the
wolf
Clock
strikes
The
clock
upbraids
me
with
the
waste
of
time
Be
not
afraid
good
youth
I
will
not
have
you
And
yet
when
wit
and
youth
is
come
to
harvest
Your
wife
is
like
to
reap
a
proper
man
There
lies
your
way
due
west
Then
westwardho
Grace
and
good
disposition
attend
your
ladyship
Youll
nothing
madam
to
my
lord
by
me
Stay
I
prithee
tell
me
what
thou
thinkst
of
me
That
you
do
think
you
are
not
what
you
are
If
I
think
so
I
think
the
same
of
you
Then
think
you
right
I
am
not
what
I
am
I
would
you
were
as
I
would
have
you
be
Would
it
be
better
madam
than
I
am
I
wish
it
might
for
now
I
am
your
fool
what
a
deal
of
scorn
looks
beautiful
In
the
contempt
and
anger
of
his
lip
murdrous
guilt
shows
not
itself
more
soon
Than
love
that
would
seem
hid
loves
night
is
noon
Cesario
by
the
roses
of
the
spring
By
maidhood
honour
truth
and
every
thing
I
love
thee
so
that
maugre
all
thy
pride
Nor
wit
nor
reason
can
my
passion
hide
Do
not
extort
thy
reasons
from
this
clause
For
that
I
woo
thou
therefore
hast
no
cause
But
rather
reason
thus
with
reason
fetter
Love
sought
is
good
but
given
unsought
is
better
By
innocence
I
swear
and
by
my
youth
I
have
one
heart
one
bosom
and
one
truth
And
that
no
woman
has
nor
never
none
Shall
mistress
be
of
it
save
I
alone
And
so
adieu
good
madam
never
more
Will
I
my
masters
tears
to
you
deplore
Yet
come
again
for
thou
perhaps
mayst
move
That
heart
which
now
abhors
to
like
his
love
street
Enter
and
I
would
not
by
my
will
have
troubled
you
But
since
you
make
your
pleasure
of
your
pains
I
will
no
further
chide
you
I
could
not
stay
behind
you
my
desire
More
sharp
than
filed
steel
did
spur
me
forth
And
not
all
love
to
see
you
though
so
much
As
might
have
drawn
one
to
a
longer
voyage
But
jealousy
what
might
befall
your
travel
Being
skilless
in
these
parts
which
to
a
stranger
Unguided
and
unfriended
often
prove
Rough
and
unhospitable
My
willing
love
The
rather
by
these
arguments
of
fear
Set
forth
in
your
pursuit
My
kind
Antonio
I
can
no
other
answer
make
but
thanks
And
thanks
and
ever
thanks
and
oft
good
turns
Are
shuffld
off
with
such
uncurrent
pay
But
were
my
worth
as
is
my
conscience
firm
You
should
find
better
dealing
Whats
to
do
Shall
we
go
see
the
reliques
of
this
town
Tomorrow
sir
best
first
go
see
your
lodging
I
am
not
weary
and
tis
long
to
night
I
pray
you
let
us
satisfy
our
eyes
With
the
memorials
and
the
things
of
fame
That
do
renown
this
city
Would
youd
pardon
me
I
do
not
without
danger
walk
these
streets
Once
in
a
seafight
gainst
the
Count
his
galleys
I
did
some
service
of
such
note
indeed
That
were
I
taen
here
it
would
scarce
be
answerd
Belike
you
slew
great
number
of
his
people
ANTONIOTh
offence
is
not
of
such
a
bloody
nature
Albeit
the
quality
of
the
time
and
quarrel
Might
well
have
given
us
bloody
argument
It
might
have
since
been
answerd
in
repaying
What
we
took
from
them
which
for
traffics
sake
Most
of
our
city
did
Only
myself
stood
out
For
which
if
I
be
lapsed
in
this
place
I
shall
pay
dear
Do
not
then
walk
too
open
It
doth
not
fit
me
Hold
sir
heres
my
purse
In
the
south
suburbs
at
the
Elephant
Is
best
to
lodge
I
will
bespeak
our
diet
Whiles
you
beguile
the
time
and
feed
your
knowledge
With
viewing
of
the
town
there
shall
you
have
me
Why
I
your
purse
Haply
your
eye
shall
light
upon
some
toy
You
have
desire
to
purchase
and
your
store
I
think
is
not
for
idle
markets
sir
Ill
be
your
pursebearer
and
leave
you
for
An
hour
To
th
Elephant
I
do
remember
house
Enter
and
Nay
I
prithee
put
on
this
gown
and
this
beard
make
him
believe
thou
art
Sir
Topas
the
curate
do
it
quickly
Ill
call
Sir
Toby
the
whilst
Well
Ill
put
it
on
and
I
will
dissemble
myself
int
and
I
would
I
were
the
first
that
ever
dissembled
in
such
a
gown
I
am
not
tall
enough
to
become
the
function
well
nor
lean
enough
to
be
thought
a
good
student
but
to
be
said
an
honest
man
and
a
good
housekeeper
goes
as
fairly
as
to
say
a
careful
man
and
a
great
scholar
The
competitors
enter
Enter
and
Jove
bless
thee
Master
Parson
Bonos
dies
Sir
Toby
for
as
the
old
hermit
of
Prague
that
never
saw
pen
and
ink
very
wittily
said
to
niece
of
King
Gorboduc
That
that
is
is
so
I
being
Master
Parson
am
Master
Parson
for
what
is
that
but
that
and
is
but
is
To
him
Sir
Topas
What
ho
I
say
Peace
in
this
prison
The
knave
counterfeits
well
a
good
knave
Within
Who
calls
there
Sir
Topas
the
curate
who
comes
to
visit
Malvolio
the
lunatic
Sir
Topas
Sir
Topas
good
Sir
Topas
go
to
my
lady
Out
hyperbolical
fiend
How
vexest
thou
this
man
Talkest
thou
nothing
but
of
ladies
Well
said
Master
Parson
Sir
Topas
never
was
man
thus
wronged
Good
Sir
Topas
do
not
think
I
am
mad
they
have
laid
me
here
in
hideous
darkness
Fie
thou
dishonest
Satan
I
call
thee
by
the
most
modest
terms
for
I
am
one
of
those
gentle
ones
that
will
use
the
devil
himself
with
courtesy
Sayst
thou
that
house
is
dark
As
hell
Sir
Topas
Why
it
hath
bay
windows
transparent
as
barricadoes
and
the
clerestories
toward
the
south
north
are
as
lustrous
as
ebony
and
yet
complainest
thou
of
obstruction
I
am
not
mad
Sir
Topas
I
say
to
you
this
house
is
dark
Madman
thou
errest
I
say
there
is
no
darkness
but
ignorance
in
which
thou
art
more
puzzled
than
the
Egyptians
in
their
fog
I
say
this
house
is
as
dark
as
ignorance
though
ignorance
were
as
dark
as
hell
and
I
say
there
was
never
man
thus
abusd
I
am
no
more
mad
than
you
are
make
the
trial
of
it
in
any
constant
question
What
is
the
opinion
of
Pythagoras
concerning
wild
fowl
That
the
soul
of
our
grandam
might
haply
inhabit
a
bird
What
thinkst
thou
of
his
opinion
I
think
nobly
of
the
soul
and
no
way
approve
his
opinion
Fare
thee
well
Remain
thou
still
in
darkness
thou
shalt
hold
th
opinion
of
Pythagoras
ere
I
will
allow
of
thy
wits
and
fear
to
kill
a
woodcock
lest
thou
dispossess
the
soul
of
thy
grandam
Fare
thee
well
Sir
Topas
Sir
Topas
My
most
exquisite
Sir
Topas
Nay
I
am
for
all
waters
Thou
mightst
have
done
this
without
thy
beard
and
gown
he
sees
thee
not
To
him
in
thine
own
voice
and
bring
me
word
how
thou
findst
him
I
would
we
were
well
rid
of
this
knavery
If
he
may
be
conveniently
deliverd
I
would
he
were
for
I
am
now
so
far
in
offence
with
my
niece
that
I
cannot
pursue
with
any
safety
this
sport
to
the
upshot
Come

Adieu
goodman

I
I
Verona
An
open
place
Enter
and
Cease
to
persuade
my
loving
Proteus
Homekeeping
youth
have
ever
homely
wits
Weret
not
affection
chains
thy
tender
days
To
the
sweet
glances
of
thy
honourd
love
I
rather
would
entreat
thy
company
To
see
the
wonders
of
the
world
abroad
Than
living
dully
sluggardizd
at
home
Wear
out
thy
youth
with
shapeless
idleness
But
since
thou
lovst
love
still
and
thrive
therein
Even
as
I
would
when
I
to
love
begin
Wilt
thou
be
gone
Sweet
Valentine
adieu
Think
on
thy
Proteus
when
thou
haply
seest
Some
rare
noteworthy
object
in
thy
travel
Wish
me
partaker
in
thy
happiness
When
thou
dost
meet
good
hap
and
in
thy
danger
If
ever
danger
do
environ
thee
Commend
thy
grievance
to
my
holy
prayers
For
I
will
be
thy
headsman
Valentine
And
on
a
lovebook
pray
for
my
success
Upon
some
book
I
love
Ill
pray
for
thee
Thats
on
some
shallow
story
of
deep
love
How
young
Leander
crossd
the
Hellespont
Thats
a
deep
story
of
a
deeper
love
For
he
was
more
than
over
shoes
in
love
Tis
true
for
you
are
over
boots
in
love
And
yet
you
never
swum
the
Hellespont
Over
the
boots
Nay
give
me
not
the
boots
No
I
will
not
for
it
boots
thee
not
What
To
be
in
love
where
scorn
is
bought
with
groans
Coy
looks
with
heartsore
sighs
one
fading
moments
mirth
With
twenty
watchful
weary
tedious
nights
If
haply
won
perhaps
a
hapless
gain
If
lost
why
then
a
grievous
labour
won
However
but
a
folly
bought
with
wit
Or
else
a
wit
by
folly
vanquished
So
by
your
circumstance
you
call
me
fool
So
by
your
circumstance
I
fear
youll
prove
Tis
love
you
cavil
at
I
am
not
Love
Love
is
your
master
for
he
masters
you
And
he
that
is
so
yoked
by
a
fool
Methinks
should
not
be
chronicled
for
wise
Yet
writers
say
as
in
the
sweetest
bud
The
eating
canker
dwells
so
eating
love
Inhabits
in
the
finest
wits
of
all
And
writers
say
as
the
most
forward
bud
Is
eaten
by
the
canker
ere
it
blow
Even
so
by
love
the
young
and
tender
wit
Is
turnd
to
folly
blasting
in
the
bud
Losing
his
verdure
even
in
the
prime
And
all
the
fair
effects
of
future
hopes
But
wherefore
waste
I
time
to
counsel
the
That
art
a
votary
to
fond
desire
Once
more
adieu
My
father
at
the
road
Expects
my
coming
there
to
see
me
shippd
And
thither
will
I
bring
thee
Valentine
Sweet
Proteus
no
now
let
us
take
our
leave
To
Milan
let
me
hear
from
thee
by
letters
Of
thy
success
in
love
and
what
news
else
Betideth
here
in
absence
of
thy
friend
And
I
likewise
will
visit
thee
with
mine
All
happiness
bechance
to
thee
in
Milan
As
much
to
you
at
home
and
so
farewell
He
after
honour
hunts
I
after
love
He
leaves
his
friends
to
dignify
them
more
I
leave
myself
my
friends
and
all
for
love
Thou
Julia
thou
hast
metamorphisd
me
Made
me
neglect
my
studies
lose
my
time
War
with
good
counsel
set
the
world
at
nought
Made
wit
with
musing
weak
heart
sick
with
thought
Enter
Sir
Proteus
save
you
Saw
you
my
master
But
now
he
parted
hence
to
embark
for
Milan
Twenty
to
one
then
he
is
shippd
already
And
I
have
playd
the
sheep
in
losing
him
Indeed
a
sheep
doth
very
often
stray
An
if
the
shepherd
be
awhile
away
You
conclude
that
my
master
is
a
shepherd
then
and
I
a
sheep
I
do
Why
then
my
horns
are
his
horns
whether
I
wake
or
sleep
silly
answer
and
fitting
well
a
sheep
This
proves
me
still
a
sheep
True
and
thy
master
a
shepherd
Nay
that
I
can
deny
by
a
circumstance
It
shall
go
hard
but
Ill
prove
it
by
another
The
shepherd
seeks
the
sheep
and
not
the
sheep
the
shepherd
but
I
seek
my
master
and
my
master
seeks
not
me
therefore
I
am
no
sheep
The
sheep
for
fodder
follow
the
shepherd
the
shepherd
for
food
follows
not
the
sheep
thou
for
wages
followest
thy
master
thy
master
for
wages
follows
not
thee
Therefore
thou
art
a
sheep
Such
another
proof
will
make
me
cry
baa
But
dost
thou
hear
Gavst
thou
my
letter
to
Julia
Ay
sir
I
a
lost
mutton
gave
your
letter
to
her
a
lacd
mutton
and
she
a
lacd
mutton
gave
me
a
lost
mutton
nothing
for
my
labour
Heres
too
small
a
pasture
for
such
store
of
muttons
If
the
ground
be
overchargd
you
were
best
stick
her
Nay
in
that
you
are
astray
twere
best
pound
you
Nay
sir
less
than
a
pound
shall
serve
me
for
carrying
your
letter
You
mistake
I
mean
the
pound
a
pinfold
From
a
pound
to
a
pin
Fold
it
over
and
over
Tis
threefold
too
little
for
carrying
a
letter
to
your
lover
But
what
said
she
Nodding
Ay
Nod
ay
Why
thats
noddy
You
mistook
sir
I
say
she
did
nod
and
you
ask
me
if
she
did
nod
and
I
say
Ay
And
that
set
together
is
noddy
Now
you
have
taken
the
pains
to
set
it
together
take
it
for
your
pains
No
no
you
shall
have
it
for
bearing
the
letter
Well
I
perceive
I
must
be
fain
to
bear
with
you
Why
sir
how
do
you
bear
with
me
Marry
sir
the
letter
very
orderly
having
nothing
but
the
word
noddy
for
my
pains
Beshrew
me
but
you
have
a
quick
wit
And
yet
it
cannot
overtake
your
slow
purse
Come
come
open
the
matter
in
brief
what
said
she
Open
your
purse
that
the
money
and
the
matter
may
be
both
at
once
delivered
Well
sir
here
is
for
your
pains
What
said
she
Truly
sir
I
think
youll
hardly
win
her
Why
couldst
thou
perceive
so
much
from
her
Sir
I
could
perceive
nothing
at
all
from
her
no
not
so
much
as
a
ducat
for
delivering
your
letter
and
being
so
hard
to
me
that
brought
your
mind
I
fear
shell
prove
as
hard
to
you
in
telling
your
mind
Give
her
no
token
but
stones
for
shes
as
hard
as
steel
What
said
she
Nothing
No
not
so
much
as
Take
this
for
thy
pains
To
testify
your
bounty
I
thank
you
you
have
testernd
me
in
requital
whereof
henceforth
carry
your
letters
yourself
and
so
sir
Ill
commend
you
to
my
master
Go
go
be
gone
to
save
your
ship
from
wreck
Which
cannot
perish
having
thee
aboard
Being
destind
to
a
drier
death
on
shore
I
must
go
send
some
better
messenger
I
fear
my
Julia
would
not
deign
my
lines
Receiving
them
from
such
a
worthless
post
Tell
me
Panthino
what
sad
talk
was
that
Wherewith
my
brother
held
you
in
the
cloister
Twas
of
his
nephew
Proteus
your
son
Why
what
of
him
He
wondred
that
your
lordship
Would
suffer
him
to
spend
his
youth
at
home
While
other
men
of
slender
reputation
Put
forth
their
sons
to
seek
preferment
out
Some
to
the
wars
to
try
their
fortune
there
Some
to
discover
islands
far
away
Some
to
the
studious
universities
For
any
or
for
all
these
exercises
He
said
that
Proteus
your
son
was
meet
And
did
request
me
to
importune
you
To
let
him
spend
his
time
no
more
at
home
Which
would
be
great
impeachment
to
his
age
In
having
known
no
travel
in
his
youth
Nor
needst
thou
much
importune
me
to
that
Whereon
this
month
I
have
been
hammering
I
have
considerd
well
his
loss
of
time
And
how
he
cannot
be
a
perfect
man
Not
being
tried
and
tutord
in
the
world
Experience
is
by
industry
achievd
And
perfected
by
the
swift
course
of
time
Then
tell
me
whither
were
I
best
to
send
him
I
think
your
lordship
is
not
ignorant
How
his
companion
youthful
Valentine
Attends
the
Emperor
in
his
royal
court
I
know
it
well
Twere
good
I
think
your
lordship
sent
him
thither
There
shall
he
practise
tilts
and
tournaments
Hear
sweet
discourse
converse
with
noblemen
And
be
in
eye
of
every
exercise
Worthy
his
youth
and
nobleness
of
birth
I
like
thy
counsel
well
hast
thou
advisd
And
that
thou
mayst
perceive
how
well
I
like
it
The
execution
of
it
shall
make
known
Even
with
the
speediest
expedition
I
will
dispatch
him
to
the
Emperors
court
Tomorrow
may
it
please
you
Don
Alphonso
With
other
gentlemen
of
good
esteem
Are
journeying
to
salute
the
Emperor
And
to
commend
their
service
to
his
will
Good
company
with
them
shall
Proteus
go
Enter
And
in
good
time
now
will
we
break
with
him
Sweet
love
sweet
lines
sweet
life
Here
is
her
hand
the
agent
of
her
heart
Here
is
her
oath
for
love
her
honours
pawn
that
our
fathers
would
applaud
our
loves
To
seal
our
happiness
with
their
consents
heavenly
Julia
How
now
What
letter
are
you
reading
there
Mayt
please
your
lordship
tis
a
word
or
two
Of
commendations
sent
from
Valentine
Deliverd
by
a
friend
that
came
from
him
Lend
me
the
letter
let
me
see
what
news
There
is
no
news
my
lord
but
that
he
writes
How
happily
he
lives
how
wellbelovd
And
daily
graced
by
the
Emperor
Wishing
me
with
him
partner
of
his
fortune
And
how
stand
you
affected
to
his
wish
As
one
relying
on
your
lordships
will
And
not
depending
on
his
friendly
wish
My
will
is
something
sorted
with
his
wish
Muse
not
that
I
thus
suddenly
proceed
For
what
I
will
I
will
and
there
an
end
I
am
resolvd
that
thou
shalt
spend
some
time
With
Valentinus
in
the
Emperors
court
What
maintenance
he
from
his
friends
receives
Like
exhibition
thou
shalt
have
from
me
Tomorrow
be
in
readiness
to
go
Excuse
it
not
for
I
am
peremptory
My
lord
I
cannot
be
so
soon
provided
Please
you
deliberate
a
day
or
two
Look
what
thou
wantst
shall
be
sent
after
thee
No
more
of
stay
tomorrow
thou
must
go
Come
on
Panthino
you
shall
be
employd
To
hasten
on
his
expedition
Thus
have
I
shunnd
the
fire
for
fear
of
burning
And
drenchd
me
in
the
sea
where
I
am
drownd
I
feard
to
show
my
father
Julias
letter
Lest
he
should
take
exceptions
to
my
love
And
with
the
vantage
of
mine
own
excuse
Hath
he
excepted
most
against
my
love
how
this
spring
of
love
resembleth
The
uncertain
glory
of
an
April
day
Which
now
shows
all
the
beauty
of
the
sun
And
by
an
by
a
cloud
takes
all
away
Reenter
Sir
Proteus
your
father
calls
for
you
He
is
in
haste
therefore
I
pray
you
go
Why
this
it
is
my
heart
accords
thereto
And
yet
a
thousand
times
it
answers
No
I
Milan
The
palace
Enter
and
Sir
your
glove
Not
mine
my
gloves
are
on
Why
then
this
may
be
yours
for
this
is
but
one
Ha
let
me
see
ay
give
it
me
its
mine
Sweet
ornament
that
decks
a
thing
divine
Ah
Silvia
Silvia
Calling
Madam
Silvia
Madam
Silvia
How
now
sirrah
She
is
not
within
hearing
sir
Why
sir
who
bade
you
call
her
Your
worship
sir
or
else
I
mistook
Well
youll
still
be
too
forward
And
yet
I
was
last
chidden
for
being
too
slow
Go
to
sir
tell
me
do
you
know
Madam
Silvia
She
that
your
worship
loves
Why
how
know
you
that
I
am
in
love
Marry
by
these
special
marks
first
you
have
learnd
like
Sir
Proteus
to
wreath
your
arms
like
a
malcontent
to
relish
a
lovesong
like
a
robin
redbreast
to
walk
alone
like
one
that
had
the
pestilence
to
sigh
like
a
schoolboy
that
had
lost
his
to
weep
like
a
young
wench
that
had
buried
her
grandam
to
fast
like
one
that
takes
diet
to
watch
like
one
that
fears
robbing
to
speak
puling
like
a
beggar
at
Hallowmas
You
were
wont
when
you
laughed
to
crow
like
a
cock
when
you
walkd
to
walk
like
one
of
the
lions
when
you
fasted
it
was
presently
after
dinner
when
you
lookd
sadly
it
was
for
want
of
money
And
now
you
are
metamorphisd
with
a
mistress
that
when
I
look
on
you
I
can
hardly
think
you
my
master
Are
all
these
things
perceivd
in
me
They
are
all
perceivd
without
ye
Without
me
They
cannot
Without
you
Nay
thats
certain
for
without
you
were
so
simple
none
else
would
but
you
are
so
without
these
follies
that
these
follies
are
within
you
and
shine
through
you
like
the
water
in
an
urinal
that
not
an
eye
that
sees
you
but
is
a
physician
to
comment
on
your
malady
But
tell
me
dost
thou
know
my
lady
Silvia
She
that
you
gaze
on
so
as
she
sits
at
supper
Hast
thou
observd
that
Even
she
I
mean
Why
sir
I
know
her
not
Dost
thou
know
her
by
my
gazing
on
her
and
yet
knowst
her
not
Is
she
not
hardfavourd
sir
Not
so
fair
boy
as
wellfavourd
Sir
I
know
that
well
enough
What
dost
thou
know
That
she
is
not
so
fair
as
of
you
wellfavourd
I
mean
that
her
beauty
is
exquisite
but
her
favour
infinite
Thats
because
the
one
is
painted
and
the
other
out
of
all
count
How
painted
and
how
out
of
count
Marry
sir
so
painted
to
make
her
fair
that
no
man
counts
of
her
beauty
How
esteemst
thou
me
I
account
of
her
beauty
You
never
saw
her
since
she
was
deformd
How
long
hath
she
been
deformd
Ever
since
you
lovd
her
I
have
lovd
her
ever
since
I
saw
her
and
still
I
see
her
beautiful
If
you
love
her
you
cannot
see
her
Why
Because
Love
is
blind
that
you
had
mine
eyes
or
your
own
eyes
had
the
lights
they
were
wont
to
have
when
you
chid
at
Sir
Proteus
for
going
ungarterd
What
should
I
see
then
Your
own
present
folly
and
her
passing
deformity
for
he
being
in
love
could
not
see
to
garter
his
hose
and
you
being
in
love
cannot
see
to
put
on
your
hose
Belike
boy
then
you
are
in
love
for
last
morning
you
could
not
see
to
wipe
my
shoes
True
sir
I
was
in
love
with
my
bed
I
thank
you
you
swingd
me
for
my
love
which
makes
me
the
bolder
to
chide
you
for
yours
In
conclusion
I
stand
affected
to
her
I
would
you
were
set
so
your
affection
would
cease
Last
night
she
enjoind
me
to
write
some
lines
to
one
she
loves
And
have
you
I
have
Are
they
not
lamely
writ
No
boy
but
as
well
as
I
can
do
them
Enter
Peace
here
she
comes
Aside
excellent
motion
exceeding
puppet
Now
will
he
interpret
to
her
Madam
and
mistress
a
thousand
good
morrows
Aside
give
ye
good
evn
Heres
a
million
of
manners
Sir
Valentine
and
servant
to
you
two
thousand
Aside
He
should
give
her
interest
and
she
gives
it
him
As
you
enjoind
me
I
have
writ
your
letter
Unto
the
secret
nameless
friend
of
yours
Which
I
was
much
unwilling
to
proceed
in
But
for
my
duty
to
your
ladyship
I
thank
you
gentle
servant
Tis
very
clerkly
done
Now
trust
me
madam
it
came
hardly
off
For
being
ignorant
to
whom
it
goes
I
writ
at
random
very
doubtfully
Perchance
you
think
too
much
of
so
much
pains
No
madam
so
it
stead
you
I
will
write
Please
you
command
a
thousand
times
as
much
And
yet
pretty
period
Well
I
guess
the
sequel
And
yet
I
will
not
name
it
and
yet
I
care
not
And
yet
take
this
again
and
yet
I
thank
you
Meaning
henceforth
to
trouble
you
no
more
Aside
And
yet
you
will
and
yet
another
yet
What
means
your
ladyship
Do
you
not
like
it
Yes
yes
the
lines
are
very
quaintly
writ
But
since
unwillingly
take
them
again
Nay
take
them
Gives
hack
the
letter
Madam
they
are
for
you
Ay
ay
you
writ
them
sir
at
my
request
But
I
will
none
of
them
they
are
for
you
I
would
have
had
them
writ
more
movingly
Please
you
Ill
write
your
ladyship
another
And
when
its
writ
for
my
sake
read
it
over
And
if
it
please
you
so
if
not
why
so
If
it
please
me
madam
what
then
Why
if
it
please
you
take
it
for
your
labour
And
so
good
morrow
servant
jest
unseen
inscrutable
invisible
As
a
nose
on
a
mans
face
or
a
weathercock
on
a
steeple
My
master
sues
to
her
and
she
hath
taught
her
suitor
He
being
her
pupil
to
become
her
tutor
excellent
device
Was
there
ever
heard
a
better
That
my
master
being
scribe
to
himself
should
write
the
letter
How
now
sir
What
are
you
reasoning
with
yourself
Nay
I
was
rhyming
tis
you
that
have
the
reason
To
do
what
To
be
a
spokesman
from
Madam
Silvia
To
whom
To
yourself
why
she
woos
you
by
a
figure
What
figure
By
a
letter
I
should
say
Why
she
hath
not
writ
to
me
What
need
she
when
she
hath
made
you
write
to
yourself
Why
do
you
not
perceive
the
jest
No
believe
me
No
believing
you
indeed
sir
But
did
you
perceive
her
earnest
She
gave
me
none
except
an
angry
word
Why
she
hath
given
you
a
letter
Thats
the
letter
I
writ
to
her
friend
And
that
letter
hath
she
deliverd
and
there
an
end
I
would
it
were
no
worse
Ill
warrant
you
tis
as
well
For
often
have
you
writ
to
her
and
she
in
modesty
Or
else
for
want
of
idle
time
could
not
again
reply
Or
fearing
else
some
messenger
that
might
her
mind
discover
Herself
hath
taught
her
love
himself
to
write
unto
her
lover
All
this
I
speak
in
print
for
in
print
I
found
it
Why
muse
you
sir
Tis
dinner
time
I
have
dind
Ay
but
hearken
sir
though
the
chameleon
Love
can
feed
on
the
air
I
am
one
that
am
nourishd
by
my
victuals
and
would
fain
have
meat
be
not
like
your
mistress
Be
moved
be
moved
Nay
twill
be
this
hour
ere
I
have
done
weeping
all
the
kind
of
the
Launces

this
very
fault
I
have
receivd
my
proportion
like
the
Prodigious
Son
and
am
going
with
Sir
Proteus
to
the
Imperials
court
I

Crab

mother

my
father
wailing
my
sister
crying
our
maid
howling
our
cat
wringing
her
hands
and
all
our
house
in
a
great
perplexity
yet
did
not
this
cruelhearted
cur
shed
one
tear
He
is
a
stone
a
very
pebble
stone
and
has
no
more
pity
in
him
than
a
dog
Jew
would
have
wept
to
have
seen
our
parting
why
my
grandam
having
no
eyes
look
you
wept
herself
blind
at
my
parting
Nay
Ill
show
you
the
manner
of
it
This
shoe

left
shoe

my
mother
nay

be
so
neither
yes
it
is
so

so
it
hath
the
worser
sole
This
shoe
with
the
hole
in
it
is
my
mother
and

my
father
vengeance

There

Now

this
staff
is
my
sister
for
look

is
as
white
as
a
lily
and
as
small
as
a
wand
this
hat

Nan
our
maid
I
am
the
dog
no
the
dog
is
himself
and
I
am
the
dog
the
dog

me
and
I
am
myself
ay
so
so
Now
come
I
to
my
father
Father

blessing
Now
should
not
the
shoe
speak
a
word
for
weeping
now
should
I
kiss
my
father
well
he
weeps
on
Now

I
to
my
mother
that
she
could
speak
now
like
a
wood
woman
Well
I
kiss
her
why
there
tis
heres
my
mothers
breath
up
and

Now

to
my
sister

the
moan
she
makes
Now
the
dog
all
this
while
sheds
not
a
tear
nor
speaks
a
word
but
see
how
I
lay
the
dust
with
my
tears
Enter
Launce
away
away
aboard
Thy
master
is
shippd
and
thou
art
to
post
after
with
oars
Whats
the
matter
Why
weepst
thou
man
Away
ass
Youll
lose
the
tide
if
you
tarry
any
longer
It
is
no
matter
if
the
tied
were
lost
for
it
is
the
unkindest
tied
that
ever
any
man
tied
Whats
the
unkindest
tide
Why
he
thats
tied
here
Crab
my
dog
Tut
man
I
mean
thoult
lose
the
flood
and
in
losing
the
flood
lose
thy
voyage
and
in
losing
thy
voyage
lose
thy
master
and
in
losing
thy
master
lose
thy
service
and
in
losing
thy
service
Why
dost
thou
stop
my
mouth
For
fear
thou
shouldst
lose
thy
tongue
Where
should
I
lose
my
tongue
In
thy
tale
In
thy
tail
Lose
the
tide
and
the
voyage
and
the
master
and
the
service
and
the
tied
Why
man
if
the
river
were
dry
I
am
able
to
fill
it
with
my
tears
if
the
wind
were
down
I
could
drive
the
boat
with
my
sighs
Come
come
away
man
I
was
sent
to
call
thee
Sir
call
me
what
thou
darst
Will
thou
go
Well
I
will
go
Launce
by
mine
honesty
welcome
to
Padua
Forswear
not
thyself
sweet
youth
for
I
am
not
welcome
I
reckon
this
always
that
a
man
is
never
undone
till
he
be
hangd
nor
never
welcome
to
a
place
till
some
certain
shot
be
paid
and
the
hostess
say
Welcome
Come
on
you
madcap
Ill
to
the
alehouse
with
you
presently
where
for
one
shot
of
five
pence
thou
shalt
have
five
thousand
welcomes
But
sirrah
how
did
thy
master
part
with
Madam
Julia
Marry
after
they
closd
in
earnest
they
parted
very
fairly
in
jest
But
shall
she
marry
him
No
How
then
Shall
he
marry
her
No
neither
What
are
they
broken
No
they
are
both
as
whole
as
a
fish
Why
then
how
stands
the
matter
with
them
Marry
thus
when
it
stands
well
with
him
it
stands
well
with
her
What
an
ass
art
thou
I
understand
thee
not
What
a
block
art
thou
that
thou
canst
not
My
staff
understands
me
What
thou
sayst
Ay
and
what
I
do
too
look
thee
Ill
but
lean
and
my
staff
understands
me
It
stands
under
thee
indeed
Why
standunder
and
understand
is
all
one
But
tell
me
true
willt
be
a
match
Ask
my
dog
If
he
say
ay
it
will
if
he
say
no
it
will
if
he
shake
his
tail
and
say
nothing
it
will
The
conclusion
is
then
that
it
will
Thou
shalt
never
get
such
a
secret
from
me
but
by
a
parable
Tis
well
that
I
get
it
so
But
Launce
how
sayst
thou
that
my
master
is
become
a
notable
lover
I
never
knew
him
otherwise
Than
how
notable
lubber
as
thou
reportest
him
to
be
Why
thou
whoreson
ass
thou
mistakst
me
Why
fool
I
meant
not
thee
I
meant
thy
master
I
tell
thee
my
master
is
become
a
hot
lover
Why
I
tell
thee
I
care
not
though
he
burn
himself
in
love
If
thou
wilt
go
with
me
to
the
alehouse
if
not
thou
art
an
Hebrew
a
Jew
and
not
worth
the
name
of
a
Christian
Why
Because
thou
hast
not
so
much
charity
in
thee
as
to
go
to
the
ale
with
a
Christian
Wilt
thou
go
At
thy
service
Counsel
Lucetta
gentle
girl
assist
me
And
evn
in
kind
love
I
do
conjure
thee
Who
art
the
table
wherein
all
my
thoughts
Are
visibly
characterd
and
engravd
To
lesson
me
and
tell
me
some
good
mean
How
with
my
honour
I
may
undertake
journey
to
my
loving
Proteus
Alas
the
way
is
wearisome
and
long
truedevoted
pilgrim
is
not
weary
To
measure
kingdoms
with
his
feeble
steps
Much
less
shall
she
that
hath
Loves
wings
to
fly
And
when
the
flight
is
made
to
one
so
dear
Of
such
divine
perfection
as
Sir
Proteus
Better
forbear
till
Proteus
make
return
knowst
thou
not
his
looks
are
my
souls
food
Pity
the
dearth
that
I
have
pined
in
By
longing
for
that
food
so
long
a
time
Didst
thou
but
know
the
inly
touch
of
love
Thou
wouldst
as
soon
go
kindle
fire
with
snow
As
seek
to
quench
the
fire
of
love
with
words
I
do
not
seek
to
quench
your
loves
hot
fire
But
qualify
the
fires
extreme
rage
Lest
it
should
burn
above
the
bounds
of
reason
The
more
thou
damst
it
up
the
more
it
burns
The
current
that
with
gentle
murmur
glides
Thou
knowst
being
stoppd
impatiently
doth
rage
But
when
his
fair
course
is
not
hindered
He
makes
sweet
music
with
th
enamelld
stones
Giving
a
gentle
kiss
to
every
sedge
He
overtaketh
in
his
pilgrimage
And
so
by
many
winding
nooks
he
strays
With
willing
sport
to
the
wild
ocean
Then
let
me
go
and
hinder
not
my
course
Ill
be
as
patient
as
a
gentle
stream
And
make
a
pastime
of
each
weary
step
Till
the
last
step
have
brought
me
to
my
love
And
there
Ill
rest
as
after
much
turmoil
blessed
soul
doth
in
Elysium
But
in
what
habit
will
you
go
along
Not
like
a
woman
for
I
would
prevent
The
loose
encounters
of
lascivious
men
Gentle
Lucetta
fit
me
with
such
weeds
As
may
beseem
some
wellreputed
page
Why
then
your
ladyship
must
cut
your
hair
No
girl
Ill
knit
it
up
in
silken
strings
With
twenty
oddconceited
truelove
knots
To
be
fantastic
may
become
a
youth
Of
greater
time
than
I
shall
show
to
be
What
fashion
madam
shall
I
make
your
breeches
That
fits
as
well
as
Tell
me
good
my
lord
What
compass
will
you
wear
your
farthingale
Why
evn
what
fashion
thou
best
likes
Lucetta
You
must
needs
have
them
with
a
codpiece
madam
Out
out
Lucetta
that
will
be
illfavourd
round
hose
madam
nows
not
worth
a
pin
Unless
you
have
a
codpiece
to
stick
pins
on
Lucetta
as
thou
lovst
me
let
me
have
What
thou
thinkst
meet
and
is
most
mannerly
But
tell
me
wench
how
will
the
world
repute
me
For
undertaking
so
unstaid
a
journey
I
fear
me
it
will
make
me
scandalizd
If
you
think
so
then
stay
at
home
and
go
not
Nay
that
I
will
not
Then
never
dream
on
infamy
but
go
If
Proteus
like
your
journey
when
you
come
No
matter
whos
displeasd
when
you
are
gone
I
fear
me
he
will
scarce
be
pleasd
withal
That
is
the
least
Lucetta
of
my
fear
thousand
oaths
an
ocean
of
his
tears
And
instances
of
infinite
of
love
Warrant
me
welcome
to
my
Proteus
All
these
are
servants
to
deceitful
men
Base
men
that
use
them
to
so
base
effect
But
truer
stars
did
govern
Proteus
birth
His
words
are
bonds
his
oaths
are
oracles
His
love
sincere
his
thoughts
immaculate
His
tears
pure
messengers
sent
from
his
heart
His
heart
as
far
from
fraud
as
heaven
from
earth
Pray
heavn
he
prove
so
when
you
come
to
him
Now
as
thou
lovst
me
do
him
not
that
wrong
To
bear
a
hard
opinion
of
his
truth
Only
deserve
my
love
by
loving
him
And
presently
go
with
me
to
my
chamber
To
take
a
note
of
what
I
stand
in
need
of
To
furnish
me
upon
my
longing
journey
All
that
is
mine
I
leave
at
thy
dispose
My
goods
my
lands
my
reputation
Only
in
lieu
thereof
dispatch
me
hence
Come
answer
not
but
to
it
presently
I
am
impatient
of
my
tarriance
I
Milan
The
palace
Enter
and
Sir
Thurio
give
us
leave
I
pray
awhile
We
have
some
secrets
to
confer
about
Now
tell
me
Proteus
whats
your
will
with
me
My
gracious
lord
that
which
I
would
discover
The
law
of
friendship
bids
me
to
conceal
But
when
I
call
to
mind
your
gracious
favours
Done
to
me
undeserving
as
I
am
My
duty
pricks
me
on
to
utter
that
Which
else
no
worldly
good
should
draw
from
me
Know
worthy
prince
Sir
Valentine
my
friend
This
night
intends
to
steal
away
your
daughter
Myself
am
one
made
privy
to
the
plot
I
know
you
have
determind
to
bestow
her
On
Thurio
whom
your
gentle
daughter
hates
And
should
she
thus
be
stoln
away
from
you
It
would
be
much
vexation
to
your
age
Thus
for
my
dutys
sake
I
rather
chose
To
cross
my
friend
in
his
intended
drift
Than
by
concealing
it
heap
on
your
head
pack
of
sorrows
which
would
press
you
down
Being
unprevented
to
your
timeless
grave
Proteus
I
thank
thee
for
thine
honest
care
Which
to
requite
command
me
while
I
live
This
love
of
theirs
myself
have
often
seen
Haply
when
they
have
judgd
me
fast
asleep
And
oftentimes
have
purposd
to
forbid
Sir
Valentine
her
company
and
my
court
But
fearing
lest
my
jealous
aim
might
err
And
so
unworthily
disgrace
the
man
rashness
that
I
ever
yet
have
shunnd
I
gave
him
gentle
looks
thereby
to
find
That
which
thyself
hast
now
disclosd
to
me
And
that
thou
mayst
perceive
my
fear
of
this
Knowing
that
tender
youth
is
soon
suggested
I
nightly
lodge
her
in
an
upper
towr
The
key
whereof
myself
have
ever
kept
And
thence
she
cannot
be
conveyd
away
Know
noble
lord
they
have
devisd
a
mean
How
he
her
chamber
window
will
ascend
And
with
a
corded
ladder
fetch
her
down
For
which
the
youthful
lover
now
is
gone
And
this
way
comes
he
with
it
presently
Where
if
it
please
you
you
may
intercept
him
But
good
my
lord
do
it
so
cunningly
That
my
discovery
be
not
aimed
at
For
love
of
you
not
hate
unto
my
friend
Hath
made
me
publisher
of
this
pretence
Upon
mine
honour
he
shall
never
know
That
I
had
any
light
from
thee
of
this
Adieu
my
lord
Sir
Valentine
is
coming
Enter
Sir
Valentine
whither
away
so
fast
Please
it
your
Grace
there
is
a
messenger
That
stays
to
bear
my
letters
to
my
friends
And
I
am
going
to
deliver
them
Be
they
of
much
import
The
tenour
of
them
doth
but
signify
My
health
and
happy
being
at
your
court
Nay
then
no
matter
stay
with
me
awhile
I
am
to
break
with
thee
of
some
affairs
That
touch
me
near
wherein
thou
must
be
secret
Tis
not
unknown
to
thee
that
I
have
sought
To
match
my
friend
Sir
Thurio
to
my
daughter
I
know
it
well
my
lord
and
sure
the
match
Were
rich
and
honourable
besides
the
gentleman
Is
full
of
virtue
bounty
worth
and
qualities
Beseeming
such
a
wife
as
your
fair
daughter
Cannot
your
grace
win
her
to
fancy
him
No
trust
me
she
is
peevish
sullen
froward
Proud
disobedient
stubborn
lacking
duty
Neither
regarding
that
she
is
my
child
Nor
fearing
me
as
if
I
were
her
father
And
may
I
say
to
thee
this
pride
of
hers
Upon
advice
hath
drawn
my
love
from
her
And
where
I
thought
the
remnant
of
mine
age
Should
have
been
cherishd
by
her
childlike
duty
I
now
am
full
resolvd
to
take
a
wife
And
turn
her
out
to
who
will
take
her
in
Then
let
her
beauty
be
her
weddingdowr
For
me
and
my
possessions
she
esteems
not
What
would
your
Grace
have
me
to
do
in
this
There
is
a
lady
in
Verona
here
Whom
I
affect
but
she
is
nice
and
coy
And
nought
esteems
my
aged
eloquence
Now
therefore
would
I
have
thee
to
my
tutor
For
long
agone
I
have
forgot
to
court
Besides
the
fashion
of
the
time
is
changd
How
and
which
way
I
may
bestow
myself
To
be
regarded
in
her
sunbright
eye
Win
her
with
gifts
if
she
respect
not
words
Dumb
jewels
often
in
their
silent
kind
More
than
quick
words
do
move
a
womans
mind
But
she
did
scorn
a
present
that
I
sent
her
woman
sometime
scorns
what
best
contents
her
Send
her
another
never
give
her
oer
For
scorn
at
first
makes
afterlove
the
more
If
she
do
frown
tis
not
in
hate
of
you
But
rather
to
beget
more
love
in
you
If
she
do
chide
tis
not
to
have
you
gone
For
why
the
fools
are
mad
if
left
alone
Take
no
repulse
whatever
she
doth
say
For
Get
you
gone
she
doth
not
mean
Away
Flatter
and
praise
commend
extol
their
graces
Though
neer
so
black
say
they
have
angels
faces
That
man
that
hath
a
tongue
I
say
is
no
man
If
with
his
tongue
he
cannot
win
a
woman
But
she
I
mean
is
promisd
by
her
friends
Unto
a
youthful
gentleman
of
worth
And
kept
severely
from
resort
of
men
That
no
man
hath
access
by
day
to
her
Why
then
I
would
resort
to
her
by
night
Ay
but
the
doors
be
lockd
and
keys
kept
safe
That
no
man
hath
recourse
to
her
by
night
What
lets
but
one
may
enter
at
her
window
Her
chamber
is
aloft
far
from
the
ground
And
built
so
shelving
that
one
cannot
climb
it
Without
apparent
hazard
of
his
life
Why
then
a
ladder
quaintly
made
of
cords
To
cast
up
with
a
pair
of
anchoring
hooks
Would
serve
to
scale
another
Heros
towr
So
bold
Leander
would
adventure
it
Now
as
thou
art
a
gentleman
of
blood
Advise
me
where
I
may
have
such
a
ladder
When
would
you
use
it
Pray
sir
tell
me
that
This
very
night
for
Love
is
like
a
child
That
longs
for
everything
that
he
can
come
by
By
seven
oclock
Ill
get
you
such
a
ladder
But
hark
thee
I
will
go
to
her
alone
How
shall
I
best
convey
the
ladder
thither
It
will
be
light
my
lord
that
you
may
bear
it
Under
a
cloak
that
is
of
any
length
cloak
as
long
as
thine
will
serve
the
turn
Ay
my
good
lord
Then
let
me
see
thy
cloak
Ill
get
me
one
of
such
another
length
Why
any
cloak
will
serve
the
turn
my
lord
How
shall
I
fashion
me
to
wear
a
cloak
I
pray
thee
let
me
feel
thy
cloak
upon
me
What
letter
is
this
same
Whats
here
To
Silvia
And
here
an
engine
fit
for
my
proceeding
Ill
be
so
bold
to
break
the
seal
for
once
Reads
My
thoughts
do
harbour
with
my
Silvia
nightly
And
slaves
they
are
to
me
that
send
them
flying
could
their
master
come
and
go
as
lightly
Himself
would
lodge
where
senseless
they
are
lying
My
herald
thoughts
in
thy
pure
bosom
rest
them
While
I
their
king
that
thither
them
importune
Do
curse
the
grace
that
with
such
grace
hath
blest
them
Because
myself
do
want
my
servants
fortune
I
curse
myself
for
they
are
sent
by
me
That
they
should
harbour
where
their
lord
should
be
Whats
here
Silvia
this
night
I
will
enfranchise
thee
Tis
so
and
heres
the
ladder
for
the
purpose
Why
Phaethon
for
thou
art
Merops
son
Wilt
thou
aspire
to
guide
the
heavenly
car
And
with
thy
daring
folly
burn
the
world
Wilt
thou
reach
stars
because
they
shine
on
thee
Go
base
intruder
overweening
slave
Bestow
thy
fawning
smiles
on
equal
mates
And
think
my
patience
more
than
thy
desert
Is
privilege
for
thy
departure
hence
Thank
me
for
this
more
than
for
all
the
favours
Which
all
too
much
I
have
bestowd
on
thee
But
if
thou
linger
in
my
territories
Longer
than
swiftest
expedition
Will
give
thee
time
to
leave
our
royal
court
By
heaven
my
wrath
shall
far
exceed
the
love
I
ever
bore
my
daughter
or
thyself
Be
gone
I
will
not
hear
thy
vain
excuse
But
as
thou
lovst
thy
life
make
speed
from
hence
And
why
not
death
rather
than
living
torment
To
die
is
to
be
banishd
from
myself
And
Silvia
is
myself
banishd
from
her
Is
self
from
self
a
deadly
banishment
What
light
is
light
if
Silvia
be
not
seen
What
joy
is
joy
if
Silvia
be
not
by
Unless
it
be
to
think
that
she
is
by
And
feed
upon
the
shadow
of
perfection
Except
I
be
by
Silvia
in
the
night
There
is
no
music
in
the
nightingale
Unless
I
look
on
Silvia
in
the
day
There
is
no
day
for
me
to
look
upon
She
is
my
essence
and
I
leave
to
be
If
I
be
not
by
her
fair
influence
Fosterd
illumind
cherishd
kept
alive
I
fly
not
death
to
fly
his
deadly
doom
Tarry
I
here
I
but
attend
on
death
But
fly
I
hence
I
fly
away
from
life
Enter
and
Run
boy
run
run
seek
him
out
Soho
soho
What
seest
thou
Him
we
go
to
find
theres
not
a
hair
on
s
head
but
tis
a
Valentine
Valentine
No
Who
then
his
spirit
Neither
What
then
Nothing
Can
nothing
speak
Master
shall
I
strike
Who
wouldst
thou
strike
Nothing
Villain
forbear
Why
sir
Ill
strike
nothing
I
pray
you
Sirrah
I
say
forbear
Friend
Valentine
a
word
My
ears
are
stoppd
and
cannot
hear
good
news
So
much
of
bad
already
hath
possessd
them
Then
in
dumb
silence
will
I
bury
mine
For
they
are
harsh
untuneable
and
bad
Is
Silvia
dead
No
Valentine
No
Valentine
indeed
for
sacred
Silvia
Hath
she
forsworn
me
No
Valentine
No
Valentine
if
Silvia
have
forsworn
me
What
is
your
news
Sir
there
is
a
proclamation
that
you
are
vanished
That
thou
art
banished
thats
the
news
From
hence
from
Silvia
and
from
me
thy
friend
I
have
fed
upon
this
woe
already
And
now
excess
of
it
will
make
me
surfeit
Doth
Silvia
know
that
I
am
banished
Ay
ay
and
she
hath
offered
to
the
doom
Which
unreversd
stands
in
effectual
force
sea
of
melting
pearl
which
some
call
tears
Those
at
her
fathers
churlish
feet
she
tenderd
With
them
upon
her
knees
her
humble
self
Wringing
her
hands
whose
whiteness
so
became
them
As
if
but
now
they
waxed
pale
for
woe
But
neither
bended
knees
pure
hands
held
up
Sad
sighs
deep
groans
nor
silvershedding
tears
Could
penetrate
her
uncompassionate
sire
But
Valentine
if
he
be
taen
must
die
Besides
her
intercession
chafd
him
so
When
she
for
thy
repeal
was
suppliant
That
to
close
prison
he
commanded
her
With
many
bitter
threats
of
biding
there
No
more
unless
the
next
word
that
thou
speakst
Have
some
malignant
power
upon
my
life
If
so
I
pray
thee
breathe
it
in
mine
ear
As
ending
anthem
of
my
endless
dolour
Cease
to
lament
for
that
thou
canst
not
help
And
study
help
for
that
which
thou
lamentst
Time
is
the
nurse
and
breeder
of
all
good
Here
if
thou
stay
thou
canst
not
see
thy
love
Besides
thy
staying
will
abridge
thy
life
Hope
is
a
lovers
staff
walk
hence
with
that
And
manage
it
against
despairing
thoughts
Thy
letters
may
be
here
though
thou
art
hence
Which
being
writ
to
me
shall
be
deliverd
Even
in
the
milkwhite
bosom
of
thy
love
The
time
now
serves
not
to
expostulate
Come
Ill
convey
thee
through
the
city
gate
And
ere
I
part
with
thee
confer
at
large
Of
all
that
may
concern
thy
love
affairs
As
thou
lovst
Silvia
though
not
for
thyself
Regard
thy
danger
and
along
with
me
I
pray
thee
Launce
an
if
thou
seest
my
boy
Bid
him
make
haste
and
meet
me
at
the
Northgate
Go
sirrah
find
him
out
Come
Valentine
my
dear
Silvia
Hapless
Valentine
I
am
but
a
fool
look
you
and
yet
I
have
the
wit
to
think
my
master
is
a
kind
of
a
knave
but
thats
all
one
if
he
be
but
one
knave
He
lives
not
now
that
knows
me
to
be
in
love
yet
I
am
in
love
but
a
team
of
horse
shall
not
pluck
that
from
me
nor
who
tis
I
love
and
yet
tis
a
woman
but
what
woman
I
will
not
tell
myself
and
yet
tis
a
milkmaid
yet
tis
not
a
maid
for
she
hath
had
gossips
yet
tis
a
maid
for
she
is
her
masters
maid
and
serves
for
wages
She
hath
more
qualities
than
a
waterspaniel
which
is
much
in
a
bare
Christian

no
names
Here
follow
her
vices
Close
at

More

it
is
more

the
salt
the
hair

turn
Why

Pox

letter
An
unmannerly
slave
that
will
thrust
himself
into
secrets
Ill
after
to
rejoice
in
the
boys
correction
Already
have
I
been
false
to
Valentine
And
now
I
must
be
as
unjust
to
Thurio
Under
the
colour
of
commending
him
I
have
access
my
own
love
to
prefer
But
Silvia
is
too
fair
too
true
too
holy
To
be
corrupted
with
my
worthless
gifts
When
I
protest
true
loyalty
to
her
She
twits
me
with
my
falsehood
to
my
friend
When
to
her
beauty
I
commend
my
vows
She
bids
me
think
how
I
have
been
forsworn
In
breaking
faith
with
Julia
whom
I
lovd
And
notwithstanding
all
her
sudden
quips
The
least
whereof
would
quell
a
lovers
hope
Yet
spaniellike
the
more
she
spurns
my
love
The
more
it
grows
and
fawneth
on
her
still
Enter
and
But
here
comes
Thurio
Now
must
we
to
her
window
And
give
some
evening
music
to
her
ear
How
now
Sir
Proteus
are
you
crept
before
us
Ay
gentle
Thurio
for
you
know
that
love
Will
creep
in
service
where
it
cannot
go
Ay
but
I
hope
sir
that
you
love
not
here
Sir
but
I
do
or
else
I
would
be
hence
Who
Silvia
Ay
Silvia
for
your
sake
I
thank
you
for
your
own
Now
gentlemen
Lets

it
lustily
awhile
Enter

a
distance
and
in
boys
clothes
Now
my
young
guest
methinks
youre
allycholly
I
pray
you
why
is
it
Marry
mine
host
because
I
cannot
be
merry
Come

you
merry
Ill
bring
you
where
you
shall
hear
music
and
see
the
gentleman
that
you
askd
for
But

I
hear
him
speak
Ay
that
you
shall
Music

That
will
be
music
Hark
hark
Is
he
among
these
Ay
but
peace
lets
hear
em
Who
is
Silvia
What
is
she
That
all
our
swains
commend
her
Holy
fair
and
wise
is
she
The
heaven
such
grace
did
lend
her
That
she
might
admired
be
Is
she
kind
as
she
is
fair
For
beauty
lives
with
kindness
Love
doth
to
her
eyes
repair
To
help
him
of
his
blindness
And
being
helpd
inhabits
there
Then
to
Silvia
let
us
sing
That
Silvia
is
excelling
She
excels
each
mortal
thing
Upon
the
dull
earth
dwelling
To
her
let
us
garlands
bring
How
now
are
you
sadder
than
you
were
before
How
do
you
man
The
music
likes
you
not
You
mistake
the
musician
likes
me
not
Why
my
pretty
youth
He
plays
false
father
How
out
of
tune
on
the
strings
Not
so
but
yet
so
false
that
he
grieves
my
very
heartstrings
You
have
a
quick
ear
Ay
I
would
I
were
deaf
it
makes
me
have
a
slow
heart
I
perceive
you
delight
not
in
music
Not
a
whit
when
it
jars
so
Hark
what
fine
change
is
in
the
music
Ay
that
change
is
the
spite
You
would
have
them
always
play
but
one
thing
I
would
always
have
one
play
but
one
thing
But
Host
doth
this
Sir
Proteus
that
we
talk
on
Often
resort
unto
this
gentlewoman
I
tell
you
what
Launce
his
man
told
me
he
lovd
her
out
of
all
nick
Where
is
Launce
Gone
to
seek
his
dog
which
tomorrow
by
his
masters
command
he
must
carry
for
a
present
to
his
lady
Peace
stand
aside
the
company
parts
Sir
Thurio
fear
not
you
I
will
so
plead
That
you
shall
say
my
cunning
drift
excels
Where
meet
we
At
Saint
Gregorys
well
Farewell
Enter
above
at
her
window
Madam
good
evn
to
your
ladyship
I
thank
you
for
your
music
gentlemen
Who
is
that
that
spake
One
lady
if
you
knew
his
pure
hearts
truth
You
would
quickly
learn
to
know
him
by
his
voice
Sir
Proteus
as
I
take
it
Sir
Proteus
gentle
lady
and
your
servant
Whats
your
will
That
I
may
compass
yours
You
have
your
wish
my
will
is
even
this
That
presently
you
hie
you
home
to
bed
Thou
subtle
perjurd
false
disloyal
man
Thinkst
thou
I
am
so
shallow
so
conceitless
To
be
seduced
by
thy
flattery
That
hast
deceivd
so
many
with
thy
vows
Return
return
and
make
thy
love
amends
For
me
by
this
pale
queen
of
night
I
swear
I
am
so
far
from
granting
thy
request
That
I
despise
thee
for
thy
wrongful
suit
And
by
and
by
intend
to
chide
myself
Even
for
this
time
I
spend
in
talking
to
thee
I
grant
sweet
love
that
I
did
love
a
lady
But
she
is
dead
Aside
Twere
false
if
I
should
speak
it
For
I
am
sure
she
is
not
buried
Say
that
she
be
yet
Valentine
thy
friend
Survives
to
whom
thyself
art
witness
I
am
betrothd
and
art
thou
not
ashamd
To
wrong
him
with
thy
importunacy
I
likewise
hear
that
Valentine
is
dead
And
so
suppose
am
I
for
in
his
grave
Assure
thyself
my
love
is
buried
Sweet
lady
let
me
rake
it
from
the
earth
Go
to
thy
ladys
grave
and
call
hers
thence
Or
at
the
least
in
hers
sepulchre
thine
Aside
He
heard
not
that
Madam
if
your
heart
be
so
obdurate
Vouchsafe
me
yet
your
picture
for
my
love
The
picture
that
is
hanging
in
your
chamber
To
that
Ill
speak
to
that
Ill
sigh
and
weep
For
since
the
substance
of
your
perfect
self
Is
else
devoted
I
am
but
a
shadow
And
to
your
shadow
will
I
make
true
love
Aside
If
twere
a
substance
you
would
sure
deceive
it
And
make
it
but
a
shadow
as
I
am
I
am
very
loath
to
be
your
idol
sir
But
since
your
falsehood
shall
become
you
well
To
worship
shadows
and
adore
false
shapes
Send
to
me
in
the
morning
and
Ill
send
it
And
so
good
rest
As
wretches
have
oernight
That
wait
for
execution
in
the
morn
Host
will
you
go
By
my
halidom
I
was
fast
asleep
Pray
you
where
lies
Sir
Proteus
Marry
at
my
house
Trust
me
I
think
tis
almost
day
Not
so
but
it
hath
been
the
longest
night
That
eer
I
watchd
and
the
most
heaviest
When
a
mans
servant
shall
play
the
cur
with
him
look
you
it
goes
hard
one
that
I
brought
up
of
a
puppy
one
that
I
savd
from
drowning
when
three
or
four
of
his
blind
brothers
and
sisters
went
to
it
I
have
taught
him
even
as
one
would
say
precisely
Thus
I
would
teach
a
dog
I
was
sent
to
deliver
him
as
a
present
to
Mistress
Silvia
from
my
master
and
I
came
no
sooner
into
the
diningchamber
but
he
steps
me
to
her
trencher
and
steals
her
capons
leg
tis
a
foul
thing
when
a
cur
cannot
keep
himself
in
all
companies
I
would
have
as
one
should
say
one
that
takes
upon
him
to
be
a
dog
indeed
to
be
as
it
were
a
dog
at
all
things
If
I
had
not
had
more
wit
than
he
to
take
a
fault
upon
me
that
he
did
I
think
verily
he
had
been
hangd
fort
sure
as
I
live
he
had
sufferd
fort
You
shall
judge
He
thrusts
me
himself
into
the
company
of
three
or
four
gentlemanlike
dogs
under
the
Dukes
table
he
had
not
been
there
bless
the
mark
a
pissing
while
but
all
the
chamber
smelt
him
Out
with
the
dog
says
one
What
cur
is
that
says
another
Whip
him
out
says
the
third
Hang
him
up
says
the
Duke
I
having
been
acquainted
with
the
smell
before
knew
it
was
Crab
and
goes
me
to
the
fellow
that
whips
the
dogs
Friend
quoth
I
you
mean
to
whip
the
dog
Ay
marry
do
I
quoth
he
You
do
him
the
more
wrong
quoth
I
twas
I
did
the
thing
you
wot
of
He
makes
me
no
more
ado
but
whips
me
out
of
the
chamber
How
many
masters
would
do
this
for
his
servant
Nay
Ill
be
sworn
I
have
sat
in
the
stock
for
puddings
he
hath
stoln
otherwise
he
had
been
executed
I
have
stood
on
the
pillory
for
geese
he
hath
killd
otherwise
he
had
sufferd
fort
Thou
thinkst
not
of
this
now
Nay
I
remember
the
trick
you
servd
me
when
I
took
my
leave
of
Madam
Silvia
Did
not
I
bid
thee
still
mark
me
and
do
as
I
do
When
didst
thou
see
me
heave
up
my
leg
and
make
water
against
a
gentlewomans
farthingale
Didst
thou
ever
see
me
do
such
a
trick
Enter
and
in
boys
clothes
Sebastian
is
thy
name
I
like
thee
well
And
will
employ
thee
in
some
service
presently
In
what
you
please
Ill
do
what
I
can
hope
thou
wilt
To
How
now
you
whoreson
peasant
Where
have
you
been
these
two
days
loitering
Marry
sir
I
carried
Mistress
Silvia
the
dog
you
bade
me
And
what
says
she
to
my
little
jewel
Marry
she
says
your
dog
was
a
cur
and
tells
you
currish
thanks
is
good
enough
for
such
a
present
But
she
receivd
my
dog
No
indeed
did
she
not
here
have
I
brought
him
back
again
What
didst
thou
offer
her
this
from
me
Ay
sir
the
other
squirrel
was
stoln
from
me
by
the
hangmans
boys
in
the
marketplace
and
then
I
offerd
her
mine
own
who
is
a
dog
as
big
as
ten
of
yours
and
therefore
the
gift
the
greater
Go
get
thee
hence
and
find
my
dog
again
Or
neer
return
again
into
my
sight
Away
I
say
Stayest
thou
to
vex
me
here
slave
that
still
an
end
turns
me
to
shame
Sebastian
I
have
entertained
thee
Partly
that
I
have
need
of
such
a
youth
That
can
with
some
discretion
do
my
business
For
tis
no
trusting
to
yond
foolish
lout
But
chiefly
for
thy
face
and
thy
behaviour
Which
if
my
augury
deceive
me
not
Witness
good
bringing
up
fortune
and
truth
Therefore
know
thou
for
this
I
entertain
thee
Go
presently
and
take
this
ring
with
thee
Deliver
it
to
Madam
Silvia
She
lovd
me
well
deliverd
it
to
me
It
seems
you
lovd
not
her
to
leave
her
token
She
is
dead
belike
Not
so
I
think
she
lives
Alas
Why
dost
thou
cry
Alas
I
cannot
choose
But
pity
her
Wherefore
shouldst
thou
pity
her
Because
methinks
that
she
lovd
you
as
well
As
you
do
love
your
lady
Silvia
She
dreams
on
him
that
has
forgot
her
love
You
dote
on
her
that
cares
not
for
your
love
Tis
pity
love
should
be
so
contrary
And
thinking
on
it
makes
me
cry
Alas
Well
give
her
that
ring
and
therewithal
This
letter
Thats
her
chamber
Tell
my
lady
I
claim
the
promise
for
her
heavenly
picture
Your
message
done
hie
home
unto
my
chamber
Where
thou
shalt
find
me
sad
and
solitary
How
many
women
would
do
such
a
message
Alas
poor
Proteus
thou
hast
entertaind
fox
to
be
the
shepherd
of
thy
lambs
Alas
poor
fool
why
do
I
pity
him
That
with
his
very
heart
despiseth
me
Because
he
loves
her
he
despiseth
me
Because
I
love
him
I
must
pity
him
This
ring
I
gave
him
when
he
parted
from
me
To
bind
him
to
remember
my
good
will
And
now
am
I
unhappy
messenger
To
plead
for
that
which
I
would
not
obtain
To
carry
that
which
I
would
have
refusd
To
praise
his
faith
which
I
would
have
dispraisd
I
am
my
masters
true
confirmed
love
But
cannot
be
true
servant
to
my
master
Unless
I
prove
false
traitor
to
myself
Yet
will
I
woo
for
him
but
yet
so
coldly
As
heaven
it
knows
I
would
not
have

speed
Enter
attended
Gentlewoman
good
day
I
pray
you
be
my
mean
To
bring
me
where
to
speak
with
Madam
Silvia
What
would
you
with
her
if
that
I
be
she
If
you
be
she
I
do
entreat
your
patience
To
hear
me
speak
the
message
I
am
sent
on
From
whom
From
my
master
Sir
Proteus
madam
he
sends
you
for
a
picture
Ay
madam
Ursula
bring
my
picture
there
Go
give
your
master
this
Tell
him
from
me
One
Julia
that
his
changing
thoughts
forget
Would
better
fit
his
chamber
than
this
shadow
Madam
please
you
peruse
this
letter
Pardon
me
madam
I
have
unadvisd
Deliverd
you
a
paper
that
I
should
not
This
is
the
letter
to
your
ladyship
I
pray
thee
let
me
look
on
that
again
It
may
not
be
good
madam
pardon
me
There
hold
I
will
not
look
upon
your
masters
lines
I
know
they
are
stuffd
with
protestations
And
full
of
newfound
oaths
which
he
wul
break
As
easily
as
I
do
tear
his
paper
Madam
he
sends
your
ladyship
this
ring
The
more
shame
for
him
that
he
sends
it
me
For
I
have
heard
him
say
a
thousand
times
His
Julia
gave
it
him
at
his
departure
Though
his
false
finger
have
profand
the
ring
Mine
shall
not
do
his
Julia
so
much
wrong
She
thanks
you
What
sayst
thou
I
thank
you
madam
that
you
tender
her
Poor
gentlewoman
my
master
wrongs
her
much
Dost
thou
know
her
Almost
as
well
as
I
do
know
myself
To
think
upon
her
woes
I
do
protest
That
I
have
wept
a
hundred
several
times
Belike
she
thinks
that
Proteus
hath
forsook
her
I
think
she
doth
and
thats
her
cause
of
sorrow
Is
she
not
passing
fair
She
hath
been
fairer
madam
than
she
is
When
she
did
think
my
master
lovd
her
well
She
in
my
judgment
was
as
fair
as
you
But
since
she
did
neglect
her
lookingglass
And
threw
her
sunexpelling
mask
away
The
air
hath
starvd
the
roses
in
her
cheeks
And
pinchd
the
lilytincture
of
her
face
That
now
she
is
become
as
black
as
I
How
tall
was
she
About
my
stature
for
at
Pentecost
When
all
our
pageants
of
delight
were
playd
Our
youth
got
me
to
play
the
womans
part
And
I
was
trimmd
in
Madam
Julias
gown
Which
served
me
as
fit
by
all
mens
judgments
As
if
the
garment
had
been
made
for
me
Therefore
I
know
she
is
about
my
height
And
at
that
time
I
made
her
weep
a
good
For
I
did
play
a
lamentable
part
Madam
twas
Ariadne
passioning
For
Theseus
perjury
and
unjust
flight
Which
I
so
lively
acted
with
my
tears
That
my
poor
mistress
moved
therewithal
Wept
bitterly
and
would
I
might
be
dead
If
I
in
thought
felt
not
her
very
sorrow
She
is
beholding
to
thee
gentle
youth
Alas
poor
lady
desolate
and
left
I
weep
myself
to
think
upon
thy
words
Here
youth
there
is
my
purse
I
give
thee
this
For
thy
sweet
mistress
sake
because
thou
lovst
her
Farewell
And
she
shall
thank
you
fort
if
eer
you
know
her
virtuous
gentlewoman
mild
and
beautiful
I
hope
my
masters
suit
will
be
but
cold
Since
she
respects
my
mistress
love
so
much
Alas
how
love
can
trifle
with
itself
Here
is
her
picture
let
me
see
I
think
If
I
had
such
a
tire
this
face
of
mine
Were
full
as
lovely
as
is
this
of
hers
And
yet
the
painter
flatterd
her
a
little
Unless
I
flatter
with
myself
too
much
Her
hair
is
auburn
mine
is
perfect
yellow
If
that
be
all
the
difference
in
his
love
Ill
get
me
such
a
colourd
periwig
Her
eyes
are
grey
as
glass
and
so
are
mine
Ay
but
her
foreheads
low
and
mines
as
high
What
should
it
be
that
he
respects
in
her
But
I
can
make
respective
in
myself
If
this
fond
Love
were
not
a
blinded
god
Come
shadow
come
and
take
this
shadow
up
For
tis
thy
rival
thou
senseless
form
Thou
shalt
be
worshippd
kissd
lovd
and
adord
And
were
there
sense
in
his
idolatry
My
substance
should
be
statue
in
thy
stead
Ill
use
thee
kindly
for
thy
mistress
sake
That
usd
me
so
or
else
by
Jove
I
vow
I
should
have
scratchd
out
your
unseeing
eyes
To
make
my
master
out
of
love
with
thee
I
Milan
An
abbey
Enter
The
sun
begins
to
gild
the
western
sky
And
now
it
is
about
the
very
hour
That
Silvia
at
Friar
Patricks
cell
should
meet
me
She
will
not
fail
for
lovers
break
not
hours
Unless
it
be
to
come
before
their
time
So
much
they
spur
their
expedition
Enter
See
where
she
comes
Lady
a
happy
evening
Amen
amen
Go
on
good
Eglamour
Out
at
the
postern
by
the
abbey
wall
I
fear
I
am
attended
by
some
spies
Fear
not
The
forest
is
not
three
leagues
off
If
we
recover
that
we
are
sure
enough
Come
come
Be
patient
we
must
bring
you
to
our
captain
thousand
more
mischances
than
this
one
Have
learnd
me
how
to
brook
this
patiently
Come
bring
her
away
Where
is
the
gentleman
that
was
with
her
Being
nimblefooted
he
hath
outrun
us
But
Moyses
and
Valerius
follow
him
Go
thou
with
her
to
the
west
end
of
the
wood
There
is
our
captain
well
follow
him
thats
fled
The
thicket
is
beset
he
cannot
scape
Come
I
must
bring
you
to
our
captains
cave
Fear
not
he
bears
an
honourable
mind
And
will
not
use
a
woman
lawlessly
Valentine
this
I
endure
for
thee
Nine
changes
of
the
watry
star
hath
been
The
shepherds
note
since
we
have
left
our
throne
Without
a
burden
Time
as
long
again
Would
be
filld
up
my
brother
with
our
thanks
And
yet
we
should
for
perpetuity
Go
hence
in
debt
And
therefore
like
a
cipher
Yet
standing
in
rich
place
I
multiply
With
one
We
thank
you
many
thousands
moe
That
go
before
it
Stay
your
thanks
a
while
And
pay
them
when
you
part
Sir
thats
tomorrow
I
am
questiond
by
my
fears
of
what
may
chance
Or
breed
upon
our
absence
that
may
blow
No
sneaping
winds
at
home
to
make
us
say
This
is
put
forth
too
truly
Besides
I
have
stayd
To
tire
your
royalty
We

No

So

So

Were
there
necessity
in
your
request
although
Twere
needful
I
denied

My
affairs
Do
even
drag

homeward
which
to
hinder
Were
in
your
love
a
whip
to

To

charge
and
trouble
To
save
both
Farewell

brother
Tonguetied

Queen
Speak

I
had
thought
sir
to
have
held
my
peace
until
You

drawn
oaths
from

not
to
stay
You
sir
Charge
him
too
coldly
Tell

All

The
bygone
day

Say

Hes

his
best
ward
Well
said
Hermione
To
tell
he
longs
to
see
his
son

strong
But
let
him
say
so
then
and
let
him
go
But
let
him
swear
so
and
he
shall
not
stay
Well
thwack

with
distaffs
To
Yet

Ill

of
a
week
When

Bohemia
You

lord
Ill
give

my
commission
To
let

a
month
behind
the

Prefixd
fors

Yet
good
deed
Leontes
I
love
thee
not
a
jar
o
th
clock
behind
What
lady
she
her
lord
Youll
stay
No
madam
Nay
but
you
will
I
may
not
verily
Verily
You
put
me
off
with
limber
vows
but
I
Though
you
would
seek
t
unsphere
the
stars
with
oaths
Should
yet
say
Sir
no
going
Verily
You
shall
not
go
a
ladys
verily
is
As
potent
as
a
lords
Will
go
yet
Force
me
to
keep
you
as
a
prisoner
Not
like
a
guest
so
you
shall
pay
your
fees
When
you
depart
and

How

My
prisoner
or
my

By
your
dread
verily
One
of
them
you
shall
be
Your
guest
then
madam
To
be
your
prisoner
should
import
offending
Which
is
for
me
less
easy
to
commit
Than
you
to
punish
Not
your
gaoler
then
But
your
kind
hostess
Come
Ill
question
you
Of
my
lords
tricks
and
yours
when
you
were
boys
You
were
pretty
lordings
then
We
were
fair
Queen
Two
lads
that
thought
there
was
no
more
behind
But
such
a
day
tomorrow
as
today
And
to
be
boy
eternal
Was
not
my
lord
The
verier
wag
o
th
two
We
were
as
twinnd
lambs
that
did
frisk
i
th
sun
And
bleat
the
one
at
th
other
What
we
changd
Was
innocence
for
innocence
we
knew
not
The
doctrine
of
illdoing
nor
dreamd
That
any
did
Had
we
pursud
that
life
And
our
weak
spirits
neer
been
higher
reard
With
stronger
blood
we
should
have
answerd
heaven
Boldly
Not
guilty
the
imposition
cleard
Hereditary
ours
By
this
we
gather
You
have
trippd
since
my
most
sacred
lady
Temptations
have
since
then
been
born
to
s
for
In
those
unfledgd
days
was
my
wife
a
girl
Your
precious
self
had
then
not
crossd
the
eyes
Of
my
young
playfellow
Grace
to
boot
Of
this
make
no
conclusion
lest
you
say
Your
queen
and
I
are
devils
Yet
go
on
Th
offences
we
have
made
you
do
well
answer
If
you
first
sinnd
with
us
and
that
with
us
You
did
continue
fault
and
that
you
slippd
not
With
any
but
with
us
Is
he
won
yet
Hell
stay
my
lord
At
my
request
he
would
not
Hermione
my
dearest
thou
never
spokst
To
better
purpose
Never
Never
but
once
What
Have
I
twice
said
well
When
wast
before
I
prithee
tell
me
crams
with
praise
and
makes
As
fat
as
tame
things
One
good
deed
dying
tongueless
Slaughters
a
thousand
waiting
upon
that
Our
praises
are
our
wages
you
may
rides
With
one
soft
kiss
a
thousand
furlongs
ere
With
spur
we
heat
an
acre
But
to
th
goal
My
last
good
deed
was
to
entreat
his
stay
What
was
my
first
It
has
an
elder
sister
Or
I
mistake
you
would
her
name
were
Grace
But
once
before
I
spoke
to
th
purpose
When
Nay
let
me
havet
I
long
Why
that
was
when
Three
crabbed
months
had
sourd
themselves
to
death
Ere
I
could
make
thee
open
thy
white
hand
And
clap
thyself
my
love
then
didst
thou
utter
I
am
yours
for
ever
Tis
Grace
indeed
Why
lo
you
now
I
have
spoke
to
th
purpose
twice
The
one
for
ever
earnd
a
royal
husband
Th
other
for
some
while
a
friend
Giving
her
hand
to
Aside
Too
hot
too
hot
To
mingle
friendship
far
is
mingling
bloods
I
have
tremor
cordis
on
me
my
heart
dances
But
not
for
joy
not
joy
This
entertainment
May
a
free
face
put
on
derive
a
liberty
From
heartiness
from
bounty
fertile
bosom
And
well
become
the
agent
may
I
grant
But
to
be
paddling
palms
and
pinching
fingers
As
now
they
are
and
making
practisd
smiles
As
in
a
lookingglass
and
then
to
sigh
as
twere
The
mort
o
th
deer
that
is
entertainment
My
bosom
likes
not
nor
my
brows
Mamillius
Art
thou
my
boy
Ay
my
good
lord
I
fecks
Why
thats
my
bawcock
What
hast
smutchd
thy
nose
They
say
it
is
a
copy
out
of
mine
Come
Captain
We
must
be
neat
not
neat
but
cleanly
Captain
And
yet
the
steer
the
heifer
and
the
calf
Are
all
calld
neat
Still
virginalling
Upon
his
palm
How
now
you
wanton
calf
Art
thou
my
calf
Yes
if
you
will
my
lord
Thou
wantst
a
rough
pash
and
the
shoots
that
I
have
To
be
full
like
me
yet
they
say
we
are
Almost
as
like
as
eggs
Women
say
so
That
will
say
anything
But
were
they
false
As
oerdyd
blacks
as
wind
as
waters
false
As
dice
are
to
be
wishd
by
one
that
fixes
No
bourn
twixt
his
and
mine
yet
were
it
true
To
say
this
boy
were
like
me
Come
sir
page
Look
on
me
with
your
welkin
eye
Sweet
villain
Most
dearst
my
collop
Can
thy
dam
mayt

Affection
thy
intention

the
centre
Thou
dost
make
possible
things
not
so
held
Communicatst
with
dreams
how
can
this
be
With
whats
unreal
thou
coactive
art
And
fellowst
nothing
Then
tis
very
credent
Thou
mayst
cojoin
with
something
and
thou
dost
And
that
beyond
commission
and
I
find
it
And
that
to
the
infection
of
my
brains
And
hardning
of
my
brows
What
means
Sicilia
He
something
seems
unsettled
How
my
lord
What
cheer
How
ist
with
you
best
brother
You
look
As
if
you
held
a
brow
of
much
distraction
Are
you
movd
my
lord
No
in
good
earnest
How
sometimes
nature
will
betray
its
folly
Its
tenderness
and
make
itself
a
pastime
To
harder
bosoms
Looking
on
the
lines
Of
my
boys
face
methoughts
I
did
recoil
Twentythree
years
and
saw
myself
unbreechd
In
my
green
velvet
coat
my
dagger
muzzld
Lest
it
should
bite
its
master
and
so
prove
As
ornaments
oft
do
too
dangerous
How
like
methought
I
then
was
to
this
kernel
This
squash
this
gentleman
Mine
honest
friend
Will
you
take
eggs
for
money
No
my
lord
Ill

You

Why

My

Are

so
fond
of
your
young

Do

of
ours
If

Hes

Now

sworn
friend
and
then
mine
enemy
My
parasite
my
soldier
statesman
all
He
makes
a
Julys
day
short
as
December
And
with
his
varying
childness
cures
in
me
Thoughts
that
would
thick
my
blood
So
stands
this
squire
Officd
with
me
We
two
will
walk
my
lord
And
leave
you
to
your
graver
steps

Ay

good
lord
Go

Mamillius
thourt
an
honest
man
Camillo
this
great
sir
will
yet
stay
longer
You
had
much
ado
to
make
his
anchor
hold
When
you
cast
out
it
still
came
home
Didst
note
it
He
would
not
stay
at
your
petitions
made
His
business
more
material
Didst
perceive
it
Aside
Theyre
here
with
me
already
whispring
rounding
Sicilia

a
soforth
Tis
far
gone
When
I
shall
gust
it
last
How
camet
Camillo
That
he
did
stay
At
the
good
Queens
entreaty
At
the
Queens
bet
Good
should
be
pertinent
But
so
it
is
it
is
not
Was
this
taken
By
any
understanding
pate
but
thine
For
thy
conceit
is
soaking
will
draw
in
More
than
the
common
blocks
Not
noted
ist
But
of
the
finer
natures
by
some
severals
Of
headpiece
extraordinary
Lower

Perchance
are
to
this
business
purblind
Say
Business
my
lord
I
think
most
understand
Bohemia
stays
here
longer
Ha
Stays
here
longer
Ay
but
why
To
satisfy
your
Highness
and
the
entreaties
Of
our
most
gracious
mistress
Satisfy
Th
entreaties
of
your
mistress
Satisfy
Let
that
suffice
I
have
trusted
thee
Camillo
With
all
the
nearest
things
to
my
heart
as
well
My
chambercouncils
wherein
priestlike
thou
Hast
cleansd
my
bosom
I
from
thee
departed
Thy
penitent
reformd
but
we
have
been
Deceivd
in
thy
integrity
deceivd
In
that
which
seems
so
Be
it
forbid
my
lord
To
bide
upont
thou
art
not
honest
or
If
thou
inclinst
that
way
thou
art
a
coward
Which
hoxes
honesty
behind
restraining
From
course
requird
or
else
thou
must
be
counted
servant
grafted
in
my
serious
trust
And
therein
negligent
or
else
a
fool
That
seest
a
game
playd
home
the
rich
stake
drawn
And
takst
it
all
for
jest
My
gracious
lord
I
may
be
negligent
foolish
and
fearful
In
every
one
of
these
no
man
is
free
But
that
his
negligence
his
folly
fear
Among
the
infinite
doings
of
the
world
Sometime
puts
forth
In
your
affairs
my
lord
If
ever
I
were
wilfullnegligent
It
was
my
folly
if
industriously
I
playd
the
fool
it
was
my
negligence
Not
weighing
well
the
end
if
ever
fearful
To
do
a
thing
where
I
the
issue
doubted
Whereof
the
execution
did
cry
out
Against
the
nonperformance
twas
a
fear
Which
oft
infects
the
wisest
These
my
lord
Are
such
allowd
infirmities
that
honesty
Is
never
free
of
But
beseech
your
Grace
Be
plainer
with
me
let
me
know
my
trespass
By
its
own
visage
if
I
then
deny
it
Tis
none
of
mine
Ha
not
you
seen
Camillo
But
thats
past
doubt
you
have
or
your
eyeglass
Is
thicker
than
a
cuckolds
horn
or
heard
For
to
a
vision
so
apparent
rumour
Cannot
be
mute
or
thought
for
cogitation
Resides
not
in
that
man
that
does
not
think
My
wife
is
slippery
If
thou
wilt
confess
Or
else
be
impudently
negative
To
have
nor
eyes
nor
ears
nor
thought
then
say
My
wifes
a
hobbyhorse
deserves
a
name
As
rank
as
any
flaxwench
that
puts
to
Before
her
trothplight
Sayt
and
justifyt
I
would
not
be
a
standerby
to
hear
My
sovereign
mistress
clouded
so
without
My
present
vengeance
taken
Shrew
my
heart
You
never
spoke
what
did
become
you
less
Than
this
which
to
reiterate
were
sin
As
deep
as
that
though
true
Is
whispering
nothing
Is
leaning
cheek
to
cheek
Is
meeting
noses
Kissing
with
inside
lip
Stopping
the
career
Of
laughter
with
a
sigh
a
note
infallible
Of
breaking
honesty
Horsing
foot
on
foot
Skulking
in
corners
Wishing
clocks
more
swift
Hours
minutes
noon
midnight
And
all
eyes
Blind
with
the
pin
and
web
but
theirs
theirs
only
That
would
unseen
be
wicked
is
this
nothing
Why
then
the
world
and
all
thats
int
is
nothing
The
covering
sky
is
nothing
Bohemia
nothing
My
is
nothing
nor
nothing
have
these
nothings
If
this
be
nothing
Good
my
lord
be
curd
Of
this
diseasd
opinion
and
betimes
For
tis
most
dangerous
Say
it
be
tis
true
No
no
my
lord
It
is
you
lie
you
lie
I
say
thou
liest
Camillo
and
I
hate
thee
Pronounce
thee
a
gross
lout
a
mindless
slave
Or
else
a
hovering
temporizer
that
Canst
with
thine
eyes
at
once
see
good
and
evil
Inclining
to
them
both
Were
my
wifes
liver
Infected
as
her
life
she
would
not
live
The
running
of
one
glass
Who
does
her
Why
he
that
wears
her
like
her
medal
hanging
About
his
neck
Bohemia
who
if
I
Had
servants
true
about
me
that
bare
eyes
To
see
alike
mine
honour
as
their
profits
Their
own
particular
thrifts
they
would
do
that
Which
should
undo
more
doing
Ay
and
thou
His
cupbearer
whom
I
from
meaner
form
Have
benchd
and
reard
to
worship
who
mayst
see
Plainly
as
heaven
sees
earth
and
earth
sees
heaven
How
I
am
galld
mightst
bespice
a
cup
To
give
mine
enemy
a
lasting
wink
Which
draught
to
me
were
cordial
Sir
my
lord
I
could
do
this
and
that
with
no
rash
potion
But
with
a
lingring
dram
that
should
not
work
Maliciously
like
poison
But
I
cannot
Believe
this
crack
to
be
in
my
dread
mistress
So
sovereignly
being
honourable
I
have
lovd
thee
Make
that
thy
question
and
go
rot
Dost
think
I
am
so
muddy
so
unsettled
To
appoint
myself
in
this
vexation
sully
The
purity
and
whiteness
of
my
sheets
Which
to
preserve
is
sleep
which
being
spotted
Is
goads
thorns
nettles
tails
of
wasps
Give
scandal
to
the
blood
o
th
Prince
my
son
Who
I
do
think
is
mine
and
love
as
mine
Without
ripe
moving
to
t
Would
I
do
this
Could
man
so
blench
I
must
believe
you
sir
I
do
and
will
fetch
off
Bohemia
fort
Provided
that
when
hes
removd
your
Highness
Will
take
again
your
queen
as
yours
at
first
Even
for
your
sons
sake
and
thereby
for
sealing
The
injury
of
tongues
in
courts
and
kingdoms
Known
and
allied
to
yours
Thou
dost
advise
me
Even
so
as
I
mine
own
course
have
set
down
Ill
give
no
blemish
to
her
honour
none
My
lord
Go
then
and
with
a
countenance
as
clear
As
friendship
wears
at
feasts
keep
with
Bohemia
And
with
your
queen
I
am
his
cupbearer
If
from
me
he
have
wholesome
beverage
Account
me
not
your
servant
This
is
all
Dot
and
thou
hast
the
one
half
of
my
heart
Dot
not
thou
splitst
thine
own
Ill
dot
my
lord
I
will
seem
friendly
as
thou
hast
advisd
me
miserable
lady
But
for
me
What
case
stand
I
in
I
must
be
the
poisoner
Of
good
Polixenes
and
my
ground
to
dot
Is
the
obedience
to
a
master
one
Who
in
rebellion
with
himself
will
have
All
that
are
his
so
too
To
do
this
deed
Promotion
follows
If
I
could
find
example
Of
thousands
that
had
struck
anointed
kings
And
flourishd
after
Id
not
dot
but
since
Nor
brass
nor
stone
nor
parchment
bears
not
one
Let
villainy
itself
forsweart
I
must
Forsake
the
court
To
dot
or
no
is
certain
To
me
a
breakneck
Happy
star
reign
now
Here
comes
Bohemia
Enter
This
is
strange
Methinks
My
favour
here
begins
to
warp
Not
speak
Good
day
Camillo
Hail
most
royal
sir
What
is
the
news
i
th
court
None
rare
my
lord
The
King
hath
on
him
such
a
countenance
As
he
had
lost
some
province
and
a
region
Lovd
as
he
loves
himself
even
now
I
met
him
With
customary
compliment
when
he
Wafting
his
eyes
to
th
contrary
and
falling
lip
of
much
contempt
speeds
from
me
So
leaves
me
to
consider
what
is
breeding
That
changes
thus
his
manners
I
dare
not
know
my
lord
How
dare
not
Do
not
Do
you
know
and
dare
not
Be
intelligent
to
me
Tis
thereabouts
For
to
yourself
what
you
do
know
you
must
And
cannot
say
you
dare
not
Good
Camillo
Your
changd
complexions
are
to
me
a
mirror
Which
shows
me
mine
changd
too
for
I
must
be
party
in
this
alteration
finding
Myself
thus
alterd
witht
There
is
a
sickness
Which
puts
some
of
us
in
distemper
but
I
cannot
name
the
disease
and
it
is
caught
Of
you
that
yet
are
well
How
caught
of
me
Make
me
not
sighted
like
the
basilisk
I
have
lookd
on
thousands
who
have
sped
the
better
By
my
regard
but
killd
none
so
Camillo
As
you
are
certainly
a
gentleman
thereto
Clerklike
experiencd
which
no
less
adorns
Our
gentry
than
our
parents
noble
names
In
whose
success
we
are
gentle
I
beseech
you
If
you
know
aught
which
does
behove
my
knowledge
Thereof
to
be
informd
imprisont
not
In
ignorant
concealment
I
may
not
answer
sickness
caught
of
me
and
yet
I
well
I
must
be
answerd
Dost
thou
hear
Camillo
I
conjure
thee
by
all
the
parts
of
man
Which
honour
does
acknowledge
whereof
the
least
Is
not
this
suit
of
mine
that
thou
declare
What
incidency
thou
dost
guess
of
harm
Is
creeping
toward
me
how
far
off
how
near
Which
way
to
be
prevented
if
to
be
If
not
how
best
to
bear
it
Sir
I
will
tell
you
Since
I
am
chargd
in
honour
and
by
him
That
I
think
honourable
Therefore
mark
my
counsel
Which
must
be
evn
as
swiftly
followed
as
I
mean
to
utter
it
or
both
yourself
and
me
Cry
lost
and
so
goodnight
On
good
Camillo
I
am
appointed
him
to
murder
you
By
whom
Camillo
By
the
King
For
what
He
thinks
nay
with
all
confidence
he
swears
As
he
had
seen
t
or
been
an
instrument
To
vice
you
tot
that
you
have
touchd
his
queen
Forbiddenly
then
my
best
blood
turn
To
an
infected
jelly
and
my
name
Be
yokd
with
his
that
did
betray
the
Best
Turn
then
my
freshest
reputation
to
savour
that
may
strike
the
dullest
nostril
Where
I
arrive
and
my
approach
be
shunnd
Nay
hated
too
worse
than
the
greatst
infection
That
eer
was
heard
or
read
Swear
his
thought
over
By
each
particular
star
in
heaven
and
By
all
their
influences
you
may
as
well
Forbid
the
sea
for
to
obey
the
moon
As
or
by
oath
remove
or
counsel
shake
The
fabric
of
his
folly
whose
foundation
Is
pild
upon
his
faith
and
will
continue
The
standing
of
his
body
How
should
this
grow
I
know
not
but
I
am
sure
tis
safer
to
Avoid
whats
grown
than
question
how
tis
born
If
therefore
you
dare
trust
my
honesty
That
lies
enclosed
in
this
trunk
which
you
Shall
bear
along
impawnd
away
tonight
Your
followers
I
will
whisper
to
the
business
And
will
by
twos
and
threes
at
several
posterns
Clear
them
o
th
city
For
myself
Ill
put
My
fortunes
to
your
service
which
are
here
By
this
discovery
lost
Be
not
uncertain
For
by
the
honour
of
my
parents
I
Have
uttred
truth
which
if
you
seek
to
prove
I
dare
not
stand
by
nor
shall
you
be
safer
Than
one
condemnd
by
the
Kings
own
mouth
thereon
His
execution
sworn
I
do
believe
thee
I
saw
his
heart
ins
face
Give
me
thy
hand
Be
pilot
to
me
and
thy
places
shall
Still
neighbour
mine
My
ships
are
ready
and
My
people
did
expect
my
hence
departure
Two
days
ago
This
jealousy
Is
for
a
precious
creature
as
shes
rare
Must
it
be
great
and
as
his
persons
mighty
Must
it
be
violent
and
as
he
does
conceive
He
is
dishonourd
by
a
man
which
ever
Professd
to
him
why
his
revenges
must
In
that
be
made
more
bitter
Fear
oershades
me
Good
expedition
be
my
friend
and
comfort
The
gracious
Queen
part
of
this
theme
but
nothing
Of
his
illtaen
suspicion
Come
Camillo
I
will
respect
thee
as
a
father
if
Thou
bearst
my
life
off
hence
Let
us
avoid
It
is

mine

to
command
The

Behind

Saw
I
men
scour
so
on
their
way
I
eyd

Even
to

ships
How
blest

I
In

just
censure
in
my
true
opinion
Alack
for
lesser
knowledge
How
accursd
In
being
so
blest
There

be
in
the
cup
spider
steepd
and
one
may
drink
depart
And
yet
partake
no
venom
for
his
knowledge
Is
not
infected
but
if
one
present
Th
abhorrd
ingredient
to
his
eye
make
known
How
he
hath
drunk
he
cracks
his
gorge
his
sides
With
violent
hefts
I
have
drunk
and
seen
the
spider
Camillo
was
his
help
in
this
his
pander
There
is
a
plot
against
my
life
my
crown
Alls
true
that

mistrusted
That
false
villain
Whom
I
employd
was
preemployd
by
him
He
has
discoverd
my
design
and
I
Remain
a
pinchd
thing
yea
a
very
trick
For

to
play
at

How

the
posterns
So
easily

By
his

authority
Which
often

prevaild
than
so
On

Give

not
nurse

Though

signs
of
me

Have
too
much
blood
in
him
What

this
Sport
Bear

Away

your
hearts
will
thereto
ad
Tis
pity
shes
not
honest
honourable
Praise
her
but
for
this
her
withoutdoor
form
Which
on
my
faith
deserves
high
speech
and
straight
The
shrug
the
hum
or
ha
these
petty
brands
That
calumny
doth
use
I
am
out
That
mercy
does
for
calumny
will
sear
Virtue

these
shrugs
these
hums
and

When
you
have
said
shes
goodly
come
between
Ere
you
can
say
shes
honest
But
bet
known
From
him
that
has
most
cause
to
grieve
it
should
be
Shes
an
adultress
Should
a
villain
say
so
The
most
replenishd
villain
in
the
world
He
were
as
much
more
villain
you
my
lord
Do
but
mistake
You
have
mistook
my
lady
Polixenes
for
Leontes
thou
thing
Which
Ill
not
call
a
creature
of
thy
place
Lest
barbarism
making
me
the
precedent
Should
a
like
language
use
to
all
degrees
And
mannerly
distinguishment
leave
out
Betwixt
the
prince
and
beggar
I
have
said
Shes
an
adultress
I
have
said
with
whom
More
shes
a
traitor
and
Camillo
is
federary
with
her
and
one
that
knows
What
she
should
shame
to
know
herself
But
with
her
most
vile
principal
that
shes
bedswerver
even
as
bad
as
those
That
vulgars
give
boldst
titles
ay
and
privy
To
this
their
late
escape
No
by
my
life
Privy
to
none
of
this
How
will
this
grieve
you
When
you
shall
come
to
clearer
knowledge
that
You
thus
have
publishd
me
Gentle
my
lord
You
scarce
can
right
me
throughly
then
to
say
You
did
mistake
No
if
I
mistake
In
those
foundations
which
I
build
upon
The
centre
is
not
big
enough
to
bear
schoolboys
top
Away
with
her
to
prison
He
who
shall
speak
for
her
is
afar
off
guilty
But
that
he
speaks
Theres
some
ill
planet
reigns
I
must
be
patient
till
the
heavens
look
With
an
aspect
more
favourable
Good
my
lords
I
am
not
prone
to
weeping
as
our
sex
Commonly
are
the
want
of
which
vain
dew
Perchance
shall
dry
your
pities
but
I
have
That
honourable
grief
lodgd
here
which
burns
Worse
than
tears

Beseech

lords
With

so
qualified
as

charities
Shall

To

highness
My
women

be
with
me

My
plight

Do

fools
There

no
cause
when
you
shall

your
mistress
Has
deservd

in
tears
As
I

action

Beseech

Prove

the
which

great
ones

Yourself

For

stables

wife
Ill
go
in
couples
with
her
Than
when
I
feel
and
see
her
no
farther
trust
her
For
every
inch
of
woman
in
the
world
Ay
every
dram
of
womans
flesh
is
false
If
she
be
Hold
your
peaces
Good
my
lord
It
is
for
you
we
speak
not
for
ourselves
You
are
abusd
and
by
some
putteron
That
will
be
damnd
fort
Would
I
knew
the
villain
I
would
landdamn
him
Be
she
honourflawd
I
have
three
daughters
the
eldest
is
eleven
The
second
and
the
third

and
some
five
If
this
prove
true
theyll
pay
for
t
By
mine
honour
Ill
geld
em
all
fourteen
they
shall
not
see
To
bring
false
generations
They
are
coheirs
And
I
had
rather
glib
myself
than
they
Should
not
produce
fair
issue
Cease
no
more
You
smell
this
business
with
a
sense
as
cold
As
is
a
dead
mans
nose
but
I
do
seet
and
feelt
As
you
feel
doing
thus
and
see
withal
The
instruments
that
feel
If
it
be
so
We
need
no
grave
to
bury
honesty
Theres
not
a
grain
of
it
the
face
to
sweeten
Of
the
whole
dungy
earth
What
Lack
I
credit
I
had
rather
you
did
lack
than
I
my
lord
Upon
this
ground
and
more
it
would
content
me
To
have
her
honour
true
than
your
suspicion
Be
blamd
fort
how
you
might
Why
what
need
we
Commune
with
you
of
this
but
rather
follow
Our
forceful
instigation
Our
prerogative
Calls
not
your
counsels
but
our
natural
goodness
Imparts
this
which
if
you
or
stupified
Or
seeming
so
in
skill
cannot
or
will
not
Relish
a
truth
like
us
inform
yourselves
We
need
no
more
of
your
advice
The
matter
The
loss
the
gain
the
ordring
ont
is
all
Properly
ours
And
I
wish
my
liege
You
had
only
in
your
silent
judgment
tried
it
Without
more
overture
How
could
that
be
Either
thou
art
most
ignorant
by
age
Or
thou
wert
born
a
fool
Camillos
flight
Added
to
their
familiarity
Which
was
as
gross
as
ever
touchd
conjecture
That
lackd
sight
only
nought
for
approbation
But
only
seeing
all
other
circumstances
Made
up
to
th
deed
doth
push
on
this
proceeding
Yet
for
a
greater
confirmation
For
in
an
act
of
this
importance
twere
Most
piteous
to
be
wild
I
have
dispatchd
in
post
To
sacred
Delphos
to
Apollos
temple
Cleomenes
and
Dion
whom
you
know
Of
stuffd
sufficiency
Now
from
the
oracle
They
will
bring
all
whose
spiritual
counsel
had
Shall
stop
or
spur
me
Have
I
done
well
Well
done
my
lord
Though
I
am
satisfied
and
need
no
more
Than
what
I
know
yet
shall
the
oracle
Give
rest
to
th
minds
of
others
such
as
he
Whose
ignorant
credulity
will
not
Come
up
to
th
truth
So
have
we
thought
it
good
From
our
free
person
she
should
be
confind
Lest
that
the
treachery
of
the
two
fled
hence
Be
left
her
to
perform
Come
follow
us
We
are
to
speak
in
public
for
this
business
Will
raise
us
all
Aside
To
laughter
as
I
take
it
If
the
good
truth
were
known
Nor
night
nor
day
no
rest
It
is
but
weakness
To
bear
the
matter
thus
mere
weakness
If
The
cause
were
not
in
being
part
o
th
cause
She
th
adultress
for
the
harlot
king
Is
quite
beyond
mine
arm
out
of
the
blank
And
level
of
my
brain
plotproof
but
she
I
can
hook
to
me
say
that
she
were
gone
Given
to
the
fire
a
moiety
of
my
rest
Might
come
to
me
again
Whos
there
My
lord
How
does
the
boy
He
took
good
rest
tonight
Tis
hopd
his
sickness
is
dischargd
To
see
his
nobleness
Conceiving
the
dishonour
of
his
mother
He
straight
declind
droopd
took
it
deeply
Fastend
and
fixd
the
shame
ont
in
himself
Threw
off
his
spirit
his
appetite
his
sleep
And
downright
languishd
Leave
me
solely
Go
See
how
he
fares
The
very
thought
of
my
revenges
that
way
Recoil
upon
me
in
himself
too
mighty
And
in
his
parties
his
alliance
Let
him
be
Until
a
time
may
serve
for
present
vengeance
Take
it
on
her
Camillo
and
Polixenes
Laugh
at
me
make
their
pastime
at
my
sorrow
They
should
not
laugh
if
I
could
reach
them
nor
Shall
she
within
my
powr
Enter
with
a
You
must
not
enter
Nay
rather
good
my
lords
be
second
to
me
Fear
you
his
tyrannous
passion
more
alas
Than
the
Queens
life
gracious
innocent
soul
More
free
than
he
is
jealous
Thats
enough
Madam
he
hath
not
slept
tonight
commanded
None
should
come
at
him
Not
so
hot
good
sir
I
come
to
bring
him
sleep
Tis
such
as
you
That
creep
like
shadows
by
him
and
do
sigh
At
each
his
needless
heavings
such
as
you
Nourish
the
cause
of
his
awaking
I
Do
come
with
words
as
medicinal
as
true
Honest
as
either
to
purge
him
of
that
humour
That
presses
him
from
sleep
What
noise
there
ho
No
noise
my
lord
but
needful
conference
About
some
gossips
for
your
Highness
How
Away
with
that
audacious
lady
Antigonus
I
chargd
thee
that
she
should
not
come
about
me
I
knew
she
would
I
told
her
so
my
lord
On
your
displeasures
peril
and
on
mine
She
should
not
visit
you
What
canst
not
rule
her
From
all
dishonesty
he
can
in
this
Unless
he
take
the
course
that
you
have
done
Commit
me
for
committing
honour
trust
it
He
shall
not
rule
me
La
you
now
you
hear
When
she
will
take
the
rein
I
let
her
run
But
shell
not
stumble
Good
my
liege
I
come
And
I
beseech
you
hear
me
who
professes
Myself
your
loyal
servant
your
physician
Your
most
obedient
counsellor
yet
that
dares
Less
appear
so
in
comforting
your
evils
Than
such
as
most
seem
yours
I
say
I
come
From
your
good
Queen
Good
Queen
Good
Queen
my
lord
good
Queen
I
say
good
Queen
And
would
by
combat
make
her
good
so
were
I
man
the
worst
about
you
Force
her
hence
Let
him
that
makes
but
trifles
of
his
eyes
First
hand
me
On
mine
own
accord
Ill
off
But
first
Ill
do
my
errand
The
good
Queen
For
she
is
good
hath
brought
you
forth
a
daughter
Here
tis
commends
it
to
your
blessing
Laying
down
the
child
Out
mankind
witch
Hence
with
her
out
o
door
most
intelligencing
bawd
Not
so
I
am
as
ignorant
in
that
as
you
In
so
entitling
me
and
no
less
honest
Than
you
are
mad
which
is
enough
Ill
warrant
As
this
world
goes
to
pass
for
honest
Traitors
Will
you
not
push
her
out
Give
her
the
bastard
To
Thou
dotard
thou
art
womantird
unroosted
By
thy
Dame
Partlet
here
Take
up
the
bastard
Taket
up
I
say
givet
to
thy
crone
For
ever
Unvenerable
be
thy
hands
if
thou
Takst
up
the
Princess
by
that
forced
baseness
Which
he
has
put
upont
He
dreads
his
wife
So
I
would
you
did
then
twere
past
all
doubt
Youd
call
your
children
yours
nest
of
traitors
I
am
none
by
this
good
light
Nor
I
nor
any
But
one
thats
here
and
thats
himself
for
he
The
sacred
honour
of
himself
his
Queens
His
hopeful
sons
his
babes
betrays
to
slander
Whose
sting
is
sharper
than
the
swords
and
will
not
For
as
the
case
now
stands
it
is
a
curse
He
cannot
be
compelld
to
t
once
remove
The
root
of
his
opinion
which
is
rotten
As
ever
oak
or
stone
was
sound
callat
Of
boundless
tongue
who
late
hath
beat
her
husband
And
now
baits
me
This
brat
is
none
of
mine
It
is
the
issue
of
Polixenes
Hence
with
it
and
together
with
the
dam
Commit
them
to
the
fire
It
is
yours
And
might
we
lay
th
old
proverb
to
your
charge
So
like
you
tis
the
worse
Behold
my
lords
Although
the
print
be
little
the
whole
matter
And
copy
of
the
father
eye
nose
lip
The
trick
ofs
frown
his
forehead
nay
the
valley
The
pretty
dimples
of
his
chin
and
cheek
his
smiles
The
very
mould
and
frame
of
hand
nail
finger
And
thou
good
goddess
Nature
which
hast
made
it
So
like
to
him
that
got
it
if
thou
hast
The
ordering
of
the
mind
too
mongst
all
colours
No
yellow
int
lest
she
suspect
as
he
does
Her
children
not
her
husbands
gross
hag
And
lozel
thou
art
worthy
to
be
hangd
That
wilt
not
stay
her
tongue
Hang
all
the
husbands
That
cannot
do
that
feat
youll
leave
yourself
Hardly
one
subject
Once
more
take
her
hence
most
unworthy
and
unnatural
lord
Can
do
no
more
Ill
ha
thee
burnt
I
care
not
It
is
an
heretic
that
makes
the
fire
Not
she
which
burns
int
Ill
not
call
you
tyrant
But
this
most
cruel
usage
of
your
Queen
Not
able
to
produce
more
accusation
Than
your
own
weakhingd
fancy
something
savours
Of
tyranny
and
will
ignoble
make
you
Yea
scandalous
to
the
world
On
your
allegiance
Out
of
the
chamber
with
her
Were
I
a
tyrant
Where
were

life
She
durst
not
call
me
so
If
she
did
know
me
one
Away
with
her
I
pray
you
do
not
push
me
Ill
be
gone
Look
to
your
babe

lord

yours
Jove

guiding
spirit
What

hands
You

are
thus
so
tender
oer
his
follies
Will

do
him
good
not
one
of
you
So
so
Farewell

gone
Thou
traitor

set
on
thy
wife
to
this
My
child
Away

Even

And

Take
it
up
straight
Within
this
hour
bring
me
word

done
And
by
good
testimony
or
Ill
seize
thy
life
With
that
thou
else
callst
thine
If
thou
refuse
And
wilt
encounter
with
my
wrath
say
so
The
bastard
brains
with
these
my
proper
hands
Shall
I
dash
out
Go
take
it
to
the
fire
For

setst
on
thy
wife
I

These

noble
fellows

Can

of
her
coming

Youre

Beseech

credit
We

truly
servd
you
and

So

As
recompense
of
our
dear
services
Past

to
come
that
you
do
change
this
purpose
Which
being
so
horrible
so
bloody
must
Lead
on
to
some
foul
issue
We
all
kneel
I
am
a
feather
for
each
wind
that
blows
Shall
I
live
on
to
see
this
bastard
kneel
And
call
me
father
Better
burn
it
now
Than
curse
it
then
But
be

let
it
live
It
shall
not
neither
To
You

To

So

To

Anything

That
my
ability
may
undergo
And
nobleness

At
least
thus
much
Ill
pawn
the
little
blood
which
I
have
left
To
save
the
innocent

possible
It

be
possible
Swear

For

Of

Death

thyself
but
to
thy
lewdtongud

Whom
for
this
time
we
pardon
We
enjoin
thee
As
thou
art
liegeman
to
us
that
thou
carry
This
female
bastard
hence
and
that
thou
bear
it
To
some
remote
and
desert
place
quite
out
Of
our
dominions
and
that
there
thou
leave
it
Without
more
mercy
to
it
own
protection
And
favour
of
the
climate
As
by
strange
fortune
It
came
to
us
I
do
in
justice
charge
thee
On
thy
souls
peril
and
thy
bodys
torture
That
thou
commend
it
strangely
to
some
place
Where
chance

nurse
or
end
it
Take
it
up
I

to
do
this
though
a
present
death
Had
been
more
merciful
Come

kites
and
ravens
To

Casting
their
savageness
aside

Like
offices
of
pity
Sir

deed
does
require
And

Against
this
cruelty
fight
on
thy
side
Poor

your
Highness
posts
From
those
you
sent
to
th
oracle
are
come
An
hour
since
Cleomenes
and
Dion
Being
well
arrivd
from
Delphos
are
both
landed
Hasting
to
th
court
So
please
you
sir
their
speed
Hath
been
beyond
account
Twentythree
days
They
have
been
absent
tis
good
speed
foretells
The
great
Apollo
suddenly
will
have
The
truth
of
this
appear
Prepare
you
lords
Summon
a
session
that
we
may
arraign
Our
most
disloyal
lady
for
as
she
hath
Been
publicly
accusd
so
shall
she
have
just
and
open
trial
While
she
lives
My
heart
will
be
a
burden
to
me
Leave
me
And
think
upon
my
bidding
I
Sicilia
On
the
road
to
the
Capital
Enter
and
The
climates
delicate
the
air
most
sweet
Fertile
the
isle
the
temple
much
surpassing
The
common
praise
it
bears
I
shall
report
For
most
it
caught
me
the
celestial
habits
Methinks
I
so
should
term
them
and
the
reverence
Of
the
grave
wearers
the
sacrifice
How
ceremonious
solemn
and
unearthly
It
was
i
th
offring
But
of
all
the
burst
And
the
eardeafning
voice
o
th
oracle
Kin
to
Joves
thunder
so
surprisd
my
sense
That
I
was
nothing
If
th
event
o
th
journey
Prove
as
successful
to
the
Queen
bet
so
As
it
hath
been
to
us
rare
pleasant
speedy
The
time
is
worth
the
use
ont
Great
Apollo
Turn
all
to
th
best
These
proclamations
So
forcing
faults
upon
Hermione
I
little
like
The
violent
carriage
of
it
Will
clear
or
end
the
business
When
the
oracle
Thus
by
Apollos
great
divine
seald
up
Shall
the
contents
discover
something
rare
Even
then
will
rush
to
knowledge
Go
fresh
horses
And
gracious
be
the
issue
Thou
art
perfect
then
our
ship
hath
touchd
upon
The
deserts
of
Bohemia
Ay
my
lord
and
fear
We
have
landed
in
ill
time
the
skies
look
grimly
And
threaten
present
blusters
In
my
conscience
The
heavens
with
that
we
have
in
hand
are
angry
And
frown
upon
s
Their
sacred
wills
be
done
Go
get
aboard
Look
to
thy
bark
Ill
not
be
long
before
I
call
upon
thee
Make
your
best
haste
and
go
not
Too
far
i
th
land
tis
like
to
be
loud
weather
Besides
this
place
is
famous
for
the
creatures
Of
prey
that
keep
upont
Go
thou
away
Ill
follow
instantly
I
am
glad
at
heart
To
be
so
rid
o
th
business
Come
poor
babe
I
have
heard
but
not
believd
the
spirits
o
th
dead
May
walk
again
If
such
thing
be
thy
mother
Appeard
to
me
last
night
for
neer
was
dream
So
like
a
waking
To
me
comes
a
creature
Sometimes
her
head
on
one
side
some
another
I
never
saw
a
vessel
of
like
sorrow
So
filld
and
so
becoming
in
pure
white
robes
Like
very
sanctity
she
did
approach
My
cabin
where
I
lay
thrice
bowd
before
me
And
gasping
to
begin
some
speech
her
eyes
Became
two
spouts
the
fury
spent
anon
Did
this
break
from
her
Good
Antigonus
Since
fate
against
thy
better
disposition
Hath
made
thy
person
for
the
throwerout
Of
my
poor
babe
according
to
thine
oath
Places
remote
enough
are
in
Bohemia
There
weep
and
leave
it
crying
and
for
the
babe
Is
counted
lost
for
ever
Perdita
I
prithee
callt
For
this
ungentle
business
Put
on
thee
by
my
lord
thou
neer
shalt
see
Thy
wife
Paulina
more
so
with
shrieks
She
melted
into
air
Affrighted
much
I
did
in
time
collect
myself
and
thought
This
was
so
and
no
slumber
Dreams
are
toys
Yet
for
this
once
yea
superstitiously
I
will
be
squard
by
this
I
do
believe
Hermione
hath
sufferd
death
and
that
Apollo
would
this
being
indeed
the
issue
Of
King
Polixenes
it
should
here
be
laid
Either
for
life
or
death
upon
the
earth
Of
its
right
father
Blossom
speed
thee
well
Laying
down
the
child
There
lie
and
there
thy
character
there
these
Laying
down
a
bundle
Which
may
if
fortune
please
both
breed
thee
pretty
And
still
rest
thine
The
storm
begins
Poor
wretch
That
for
thy
mothers
fault
art
thus
exposd
To
loss
and
what
may
follow
Weep
I
cannot
But
my
heart
bleeds
and
most
accursd
am
I
To
be
by
oath
enjoind
to
this
Farewell
The
day
frowns
more
and
more
Thourt
like
to
have
lullaby
too
rough
I
never
saw
The
heavens
so
dim
by
day
Noise
of
hunt
within
savage
clamour
Well
may
I
get
aboard
This
is
the
chase
I
am
gone
for
ever
Enter
an
old
I
would
there
were
no
age
between
ten
and
three
and
twenty
or
that
youth
would
sleep
out
the
rest
for
there
is
nothing
in
the
between
but
getting
wenches
with
child
wronging
the
ancientry
stealing
fighting
Horns
Hark
you
now
Would
any
but
these
boild
brains
of
nineteen
and
two
and
twenty
hunt
this
weather
They
have
scard
away
two
of
my
best
sheep
which
I
fear
the
wolf
will
sooner
find
than
the
master
If
any
where
I
have
them
tis
by
the
seaside
browsing
of
ivy
Good
luck
ant
be
thy
will
What
have
we
here
Taking
up
the
child
Mercy

very
pretty
barne
boy
or

very
pretty

Though
I

I

in

This
has
been
some
stairwork
some
trunkwork
some
behinddoorwork
they
were
warmer
that
got
this
than
the
poor
thing
is
here
Ill
take
it
up
for
pity
yet
Ill
tarry
till
my
son
come
he
hallood
but
even
now
Whoahohoa
Enter
Hilloa
loa
What
art
so
near
If
thoult
see
a
thing
to
talk
on
when
thou
art
dead
and
rotten
come
hither
What
ailst
thou
man
I
have
seen
two
such
sights
by
sea
and
by
land
But
I
am
not
to
say
it
is
a
sea
for
it
is
now
the
sky
betwixt
the
firmament
and
it
you
cannot
thrust
a
bodkins
point
Why
boy
how
is
it
I
would
you
did
but
see
how
it
chafes
how
it
rages
how
it
takes
up
the
shore
But
thats
not
to
the
point
the
most
piteous
cry
of
the
poor
souls
Sometimes
to
see
em
and
not
to
see
em
now
the
ship
boring
the
moon
with
her
mainmast
and
anon
swallowed
with
yeast
and
froth
as
youd
thrust
a
cork
into
a
hogshead
And
then
for
the
land
service
to
see
how
the
bear
tore
out
his
shoulderbone
how
he
cried
to
me
for
help
and
said
his
name
was
Antigonus
a
nobleman
But
to
make
an
end
of
the
ship
to
see
how
the
sea
flapdragond
it
but
first
how
the
poor
souls
roared
and
the
sea
mockd
them
and
how
the
poor
gentleman
roared
and
the
bear
mockd
him
both
roaring
louder
than
the
sea
or
weather
Name
of
mercy
when
was
this
boy
Now
now
I
have
not
winkd
since
I
saw
these
sights
the
men
are
not
yet
cold
under
water
nor
the
bear
half
dind
on
the
gentleman
hes
at
it
now
Would
I
had
been
by
to
have
helpd
the
old
man
I
would
you
had
been
by
the
shipside
to
have
helpd
her
there
your
charity
would
have
lackd
footing
Heavy
matters
heavy
matters
But
look
thee
here
boy
Now
bless
thyself
thou
metst
with
things
dying
I
with
things
newborn
Heres
a
sight
for
thee
look
thee
a
bearingcloth
for
a
squires
child
Look
thee
here
take
up
take
up
boy
opent
So
lets
see
it
was
told
me
I
should
be
rich
by
the
fairies
This
is
some
changeling
Opent
Whats
within
boy
Youre
a
made
old
man
if
the
sins
of
your
youth
are
forgiven
you
youre
well
to
live
Gold

gold
This
is
fairy
gold
boy
and
twill
prove
so
Up
witht
keep
it
close
Home
home
the
next
way
We
are
lucky
boy
and
to
be
so
still
requires
nothing
but
secrecy
Let
my
sheep
go
Come
good
boy
the
next
way
home
Go
you
the
next
way
with
your
findings
Ill
go
see
if
the
bear
be
gone
from
the
gentleman
and
how
much
he
hath
eaten
They
are
never
curst
but
when
they
are
hungry
If
there
be
any
of
him
left
Ill
bury
it
Thats
a
good
deed
If
thou
mayest
discern
by
that
which
is
left
of
him
what
he
is
fetch
me
to
th
sight
of
him
Marry
will
I
and
you
shall
help
to
put
him
i
th
ground
Tis
a
lucky
day
boy
and
well
do
good
deeds
ont
I
Enter
the
I
that
please
some
try
all
both
joy
and
terror
Of
good
and
bad
that
makes
and
unfolds
error
Now
take
upon
me
in
the
name
of
Time
To
use
my
wings
Impute
it
not
a
crime
To
me
or
my
swift
passage
that
I
slide
Oer
sixteen
years
and
leave
the
growth
untried
Of
that
wide
gap
since
it
is
in
my
powr
To
oerthrow
law
and
in
one
selfborn
hour
To
plant
and
oerwhelm
custom
Let
me
pass
The
same
I
am
ere
ancientst
order
was
Or
what
is
now
receivd
I
witness
to
The
times
that
brought
them
in
so
shall
I
do
To
th
freshest
things
now
reigning
and
make
stale
The
glistering
of
this
present
as
my
tale
Now
seems
to
it
Your
patience
this
allowing
I
turn
my
glass
and
give
my
scene
such
growing
As
you
had
slept
between
Leontes
leaving
Th
effects
of
his
fond
jealousies
so
grieving
That
he
shuts
up
himself
imagine
me
Gentle
spectators
that
I
now
may
be
In
fair
Bohemia
and
remember
well
I
mentiond
a
son
o
th
Kings
which
Florizel
I
now
name
to
you
and
with
speed
so
pace
To
speak
of
Perdita
now
grown
in
grace
Equal
with
wondring
What
of
her
ensues
I
list
not
prophesy
but
let
Times
news
Be
known
when
tis
brought
forth
shepherds
daughter
And
what
to
her
adheres
which
follows
after
Is
th
argument
of
Time
Of
this
allow
If
ever
you
have
spent
time
worse
ere
now
If
never
yet
that
Time
himself
doth
say
He
wishes
earnestly
you
never
may
I
have
servd
Prince
Florizel
and
in
my
time
wore
threepile
but
now
I
am
out
of
service
But
shall
I
go
mourn
for
that
my
dear
The
pale
moon
shines
by
night
And
when
I
wander
here
and
there
I
then
do
most
go
right
If
tinkers
may
have
leave
to
live
And
bear
the
sowskin
budget
Then
my
account
I
well
may
give
And
in
the
stocks
avouch
it
My
traffic
is
sheets
when
the
kite
builds
look
to
lesser
linen
My
father
namd
me
Autolycus
who
being
I
as
am
litterd
under
Mercury
was
likewise
a
snapperup
of
unconsidered
trifles
With

and
drab
I
purchasd
this
caparison
and
my
revenue
is
the
sillycheat
Gallows
and
knock
are
too
powerful
on
the
highway
beating
and
hanging
are
terrors
to
me
for
the

to
come
I

of

Three

But

She

Alack

rags
to
lay
on
thee
rather
than
have
these
off
sir
the
loathsomeness
of
them
offend
me
more
than
the
stripes
I
have
received
which
are
mighty
ones
and

Alas
poor

a
million
of
beating
may
come
to

and
beaten
my
money

and
these
detestable
things
put
upon
me
What
by
a
horseman
or
a
footman
footman
sweet
sir
a
footman
Indeed
he
should
be
a
footman
by
the
garments
he
has
left
with
thee
if
this
be
a
horsemans
coat
it
hath
seen
very
hot
service
Lend

Come

Helping

Alas

my

How

Canst

Softly

Picks

pocket
good
sir
softly
You

done
me
a
charitable
office
Dost

a
little
money
for
thee
No
good
sweet
sir
no
I
beseech
you
sir
I
have
a
kinsman
not
past
three
quarters
of
a
mile
hence
unto
whom
I
was
going
I
shall
there
have
money
or
anything
I
want
Offer
me
no
money
I
pray
you
that
kills
my
heart
What
manner
of
fellow
was
he
that
robbd
you
fellow
sir
that
I
have
known
to
go
about
with
trollmydames
I
knew
him
once
a
servant
of
the
Prince
I
cannot
tell
good
sir
for
which
of
his
virtues
it
was
but
he
was
certainly
whipt
out
of
the
court
His
vices
you
would
say
theres
no
virtue
whipt
out
of
the
court
They
cherish
it
to
make
it
stay
there
and
yet
it
will
no
more
but
abide
Vices
I
would
say
sir
I
know
this
man
well
he
hath
been
since
an
apebearer
then
a
processserver
a
bailiff
then
he
compassd
a
motion
of
the
Prodigal
Son
and
married
a
tinkers
wife
within
a
mile
where
my
land
and
living
lies
and
having
flown
over
many
knavish
professions
he
settled
only
in
rogue
Some
call
him
Autolycus
Out
upon
him
prig
for
my
life
prig
He
haunts
wakes
fairs
and
bearbaitings
Very
true
sir
he
sir
he
thats
the
rogue
that
put
me
into
this
apparel
Not
a
more
cowardly
rogue
in
all
Bohemia
if
you
had
but
lookd
big
and
spit
at
him
hed
have
run
I
must
confess
to
you
sir
I
am
no
fighter
I
am
false
of
heart
that
way
and
that
he
knew
I
warrant
him
How
do
you
now
Sweet
sir
much
better
than
I
was
I
can
stand
and
walk
I
will
even
take
my
leave
of
you
and
pace
softly
towards
my
kinsmans
Shall
I
bring
thee
on
the
way
No
goodfacd
sir
no
sweet
sir
Then
fare
thee
well
I
must
go
buy
spices
for
our
sheepshearing
Prosper
you
sweet
sir
Your
purse
is
not
hot
enough
to
purchase
your
spice
Ill
be
with
you
at
your
sheepshearing
too
If
I
make
not
this
cheat
bring
out
another
and
the
shearers
prove
sheep
let
me
be
unrolld
and
my
name
put
in
the
book
of
virtue
Sings
Jog
on
jog
on
the
footpath
way
And
merrily
hent
the
stilea
merry
heart
goes
all
the
day
Your
sad
tires
in
a
milea
Beseech
you
sir
were
you
present
at
this
relation
I
was
by
at
the
opening
of
the
fardel
heard
the
old
shepherd
deliver
the
manner
how
he
found
it
whereupon
after
a
little
amazedness
we
were
all
commanded
out
of
the
chamber
only
this
methought
I
heard
the
shepherd
say
he
found
the
child
I
would
most
gladly
know
the
issue
of
it
I
make
a
broken
delivery
of
the
business
but
the
changes
I
perceived
in
the
King
and
Camillo
were
very
notes
of
admiration
They
seemd
almost
with
staring
on
one
another
to
tear
the
cases
of
their
eyes
there
was
speech
in
their
dumbness
language
in
their
very
gesture
they
lookd
as
they
had
heard
of
a
world
ransomd
or
one
destroyed
notable
passion
of
wonder
appeared
in
them
but
the
wisest
beholder
that
knew
no
more
but
seeing
could
not
say
if
th
importance
were
joy
or
sorrow
but
in
the
extremity
of
the
one
it
must
needs
be
Enter
another
Here
comes
a
gentleman
that
happily
knows
more
The
news
Rogero
Nothing
but
bonfires
The
oracle
is
fulfilld
the
Kings
daughter
is
found
Such
a
deal
of
wonder
is
broken
out
within
this
hour
that
balladmakers
cannot
be
able
to
express
it
Enter
another
Here
comes
the
Lady
Paulinas
steward
he
can
deliver
you
more
How
goes
it
now
sir
This
news
which
is
calld
true
is
so
like
an
old
tale
that
the
verity
of
it
is
in
strong
suspicion
Has
the
King
found
his
heir
Most
true
if
ever
truth
were
pregnant
by
circumstance
That
which
you
hear
youll
swear
you
see
there
is
such
unity
in
the
proofs
The
mantle
of
Queen
Hermiones
her
jewel
about
the
neck
of
it
the
letters
of
Antigonus
found
with
it
which
they
know
to
be
his
character
the
majesty
of
the
creature
in
resemblance
of
the
mother
the
affection
of
nobleness
which
nature
shows
above
her
breeding
and
many
other
evidences
proclaim
her
with
all
certainty
to
be
the
Kings
daughter
Did
you
see
the
meeting
of
the
two
kings
No
Then
you
have
lost
a
sight
which
was
to
be
seen
cannot
be
spoken
of
There
might
you
have
beheld
one
joy
crown
another
so
and
in
such
manner
that
it
seemd
sorrow
wept
to
take
leave
of
them
for
their
joy
waded
in
tears
There
was
casting
up
of
eyes
holding
up
of
hands
with
countenance
of
such
distraction
that
they
were
to
be
known
by
garment
not
by
favour
Our
king
being
ready
to
leap
out
of
himself
for
joy
of
his
found
daughter
as
if
that
joy
were
now
become
a
loss
cries
thy
mother
thy
mother
then
asks
Bohemia
forgiveness
then
embraces
his
soninlaw
then
again
worries
he
his
daughter
with
clipping
her
Now
he
thanks
the
old
shepherd
which
stands
by
like
a
weatherbitten
conduit
of
many
kings
reigns
I
never
heard
of
such
another
encounter
which
lames
report
to
follow
it
and
undoes
description
to
do
it
What
pray
you
became
of
Antigonus
that
carried
hence
the
child
Like
an
old
tale
still
which
will
have
matter
to
rehearse
though
credit
be
asleep
and
not
an
ear
open
he
was
torn
to
pieces
with
a
bear
This
avouches
the
shepherds
son
who
has
not
only
his
innocence
which
seems
much
to
justify
him
but
a
handkerchief
and
rings
of
his
that
Paulina
knows
What
became
of
his
bark
and
his
followers
Wreckd
the
same
instant
of
their
masters
death
and
in
the
view
of
the
shepherd
so
that
all
the
instruments
which
aided
to
expose
the
child
were
even
then
lost
when
it
was
found
But
the
noble
combat
that
twixt
joy
and
sorrow
was
fought
in
Paulina
She
had
one
eye
declind
for
the
loss
of
her
husband
another
elevated
that
the
oracle
was
fulfilld
She
lifted
the
Princess
from
the
earth
and
so
locks
her
in
embracing
as
if
she
would
pin
her
to
her
heart
that
she
might
no
more
be
in
danger
of
losing
The
dignity
of
this
act
was
worth
the
audience
of
kings
and
princes
for
by
such
was
it
acted
One
of
the
prettiest
touches
of
all
and
that
which
angld
for
mine
eyes
caught
the
water
though
not
the
fish
was
when
at
the
relation
of
the
Queens
death
with
the
manner
how
she
came
tot
bravely
confessd
and
lamented
by
the
King
how
attentivenes
wounded
his
daughter
till
from
one
sign
of
dolour
to
another
she
did
with
an
Alas
I
would
fain
say
bleed
tears
for
I
am
sure
my
heart
wept
blood
Who
was
most
marble
there
changed
colour
some
swooned
all
sorrowed
If
all
the
world
could
have
seent
the
woe
had
been
universal
Are
they
returned
to
the
court
No
The
Princess
hearing
of
her
mothers
statue
which
is
in
the
keeping
of
Paulina
a
piece
many
years
in
doing
and
now
newly
performd
by
that
rare
Italian
master
Julio
Romano
who
had
he
himself
eternity
and
could
put
breath
into
his
work
would
beguile
nature
of
her
custom
so
perfectly
he
is
her
ape
He
so
near
to
Hermione
hath
done
Hermione
that
they
say
one
would
speak
to
her
and
stand
in
hope
of
answer
thither
with
all
greediness
of
affection
are
they
gone
and
there
they
intend
to
sup
I
thought
she
had
some
great
matter
there
in
hand
for
she
hath
privately
twice
or
thrice
a
day
ever
since
the
death
of
Hermione
visited
that
removed
house
Shall
we
thither
and
with
our
company
piece
the
rejoicing
Who
would
be
thence
that
has
the
benefit
of
access
Every
wink
of
an
eye
some
new
grace
will
be
born
Our
absence
makes
us
unthrifty
to
our
knowledge
Lets
along
Now
had
I
not
the
dash
of
my
former
life
in
me
would
preferment
drop
on
my
head
I
brought
the
old
man
and
his
son
aboard
the
Prince
told
him
I
heard
them
talk
of
a
fardel
and
I
know
not
what
but
he
at
that
time
overfond
of
the
shepherds
daughter
so
he
then
took
her
to
be
who
began
to
be
much
seasick
and
himself
little
better
extremity
of
weather
continuing
this
mystery
remained
undiscoverd
But
tis
all
one
to
me
for
had
I
been
the
finderout
of
this
secret
it
would
not
have
relishd
among
my
other
discredits
Enter
and
Here
come
those
I
have
done
good
to
against
my
will
and
already
appearing
in
the
blossoms
of
their
fortune
Come
boy
I
am
past
moe
children
but
thy
sons
and
daughters
will
be
all
gentlemen
born
You
are
well
met
sir
You
denied
to
fight
with
me
this
other
day
because
I
was
no
gentleman
born
See
you
these
clothes
Say
you
see
them
not
and
think
me
still
no
gentleman
born
You
were
best
say
these
robes
are
not
gentlemen
born
Give
me
the
lie
do
and
try
whether
I
am
not
now
a
gentleman
born
I
know
you
are
now
sir
a
gentleman
born
Ay

have
been
so
any
time
these
four
hours
And
so
have
I

So

but
I
was
a
gentleman
born
before
my
father
for
the
Kings
son
took
me
by
the
hand
and
calld
me
brother
and
then
the
two
kings
calld
my
father
brother
and
then
the
Prince
my
brother
and
the
Princess
my
sister
calld
my
father

And
so
we
wept
and
there
was
the
first
gentlemanlike
tears
that
ever
we
shed
We
may
live
son
to
shed
many
more
Ay

franklins

be
drunk
But

swear
it

tall
fellow

thy
hands
